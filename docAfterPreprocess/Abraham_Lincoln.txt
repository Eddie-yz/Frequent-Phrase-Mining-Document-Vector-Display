lincoln letters by abraham lincoln published by the bibilophile society note the letters herein by lincoln are so thoroughly characteristic of the man

that it requires no comment to enable the reader fully to understand and appreciate them
it will be observed that the philosophical admonitions in the letter to his brother
were written on the same sheet with the letter to his father
the promptness and decision with which lincoln despatched the multitudinous affairs of his office during the most turbulent scenes of the civil war are exemplified in his unequivocal order to the attorney general

my dear father
your letter of the 7th was received night before last
i very cheerfully send you the twenty dollars
which sum you say is necessary to save your land from sale
it is singular that you should have forgotten a judgment against you and it is more singular that the plaintiff should have let you forget it so long
particularly as i suppose you have always had property enough to satisfy a judgment of that amount
before you pay it
it would be well to be sure you have not paid it or
at least
that you can not prove you have paid it
give my love to mother
and all the connections
affectionately your son
written on same page with above
dear johnston
your request for eighty dollars
i do not think it best to comply with now
at the various times when i have helped you a little
you have said to me
we can get along very well now
but in a very short time i find you in the same difficulty again
now this can only happen by some defect in your conduct
what that defect is
i think i know
you are not lazy
and still you are an idler
i doubt whether since i saw you
you have done a good whole day's work
in any one day
you do not very much dislike to work
and still you do not work much
merely because it does not seem to you that you could get much for it
this habit of uselessly wasting time
is the whole difficulty and it is vastly important to you
and still more so to your children
that you should break this habit
it is more important to them
because they have longer to live
and can keep out of an idle habit before they are in it easier than they can get out after they are in
you are now in need of some ready money and what i propose is
that you shall go to work
tooth and nail
for somebody who will give you money for it
let father and your boys take charge of things at home prepare for a crop
and make the crop and you go to work for the best money wages
or in discharge of any debt you owe
that you can get
and to secure you a fair reward for your labor
i now promise you that for every dollar you will
between this and the first of next may
get for your own labor either in money or in your own indebtedness
i will then give you one other dollar
by this
if you hire yourself at ten dollars a month
from me you will get ten more
making twenty dollars a month for your work
in this
i do not mean you shall go off to st
or the lead mines
or the gold mines
in california
but i mean for you to go at it for the best wages you can get close to home
in coles county
now if you will do this
you will soon be out of debt
and what is better
you will have a habit that will keep you from getting in debt again
but if i should now clear you out
next year you will be just as deep in as ever
you say you would almost give your place in heaven for 70 or 80
then you value your place in heaven very cheaply
for i am sure you can with the offer i make you get the seventy or eighty dollars for four or five months' work
you say if i furnish you the money you will deed me the land
and if you don't pay the money back
you will deliver possession nonsense
if you can't now live with the land
how will you then live without it
you have always been kind to me
and i do not now mean to be unkind to you
on the contrary
if you will but follow my advice
you will find it worth more than eight times eighty dollars to you
affectionately your brother
04 to general grant washington
april 30
executive mansion
lieutenant general grant
not expecting to see you again before the spring campaign opens
i wish to express
in this way
my entire satisfaction with what you have done up to this time
so far as i understand it
the particulars of your plans i neither know
or seek to know
you are vigilant and self reliant and
pleased with this
i wish not to obtrude any constraints or restraints upon you
while i am very anxious that any great disaster
or the capture of our men in great numbers
shall be avoided
i know these points are less likely to escape your attention than they would be mine
if there is anything wanting which is within my power to give
do not fail to let me know it
and now with a brave army
and a just cause
may god sustain you
yours very truly

at charleston
september 18
ladies and gentlemen
it will be very difficult for an audience so large as this to hear distinctly what a speaker says
and consequently it is important that as profound silence be preserved as possible
while i was at the hotel to day
an elderly gentleman called upon me to know whether i was really in favor of producing a perfect equality between the negroes and white people
while i had not proposed to myself on this occasion to say much on that subject
yet as the question was asked me i thought i would occupy perhaps five minutes in saying something in regard to it
i will say
that i am not
nor ever have been
in favor of bringing about in any way the social and political equality of the white and black races that i am not
nor ever have been
in favor of making voters or jurors of negroes
nor of qualifying them to hold office
nor to intermarry with white people and i will say
in addition to this
that there is a physical difference between the white and black races which i believe will forever forbid the two races living together on terms of social and political equality
and in as much as they cannot so live
while they do remain together there must be the position of superior and inferior
and i as much as any other man am in favor of having the superior position assigned to the white race
i say upon this occasion i do not perceive that because the white man is to have the superior position the negro should be denied everything
i do not understand that because i do not want a negro woman for a slave i must necessarily want her for a wife
my understanding is that i can just let her alone
i am now in my fiftieth year
and i certainly never have had a black woman for either a slave or a wife
so it seems to me quite possible for us to get along without making either slaves or wives of negroes
i will add to this that i have never seen
to my knowledge
a man
or child who was in favor of producing a perfect equality
social and political
between negroes and white men
i recollect of but one distinguished instance that i ever heard of so frequently as to be entirely satisfied of its correctness
and that is the case of judge douglas's old friend colonel richard m
i will also add to the remarks i have made for i am not going to enter at large upon this subject
that i have never had the least apprehension that i or my friends would marry negroes if there was no law to keep them from it but as judge douglas and his friends seem to be in great apprehension that they might
if there were no law to keep them from it
i give him the most solemn pledge that i will to the very last stand by the law of this state which forbids the marrying of white people with negroes
i will add one further word
which is this
that i do not understand that there is any place where an alteration of the social and political relations of the negro and the white man can be made
except in the state legislature
not in the congress of the united states and as i do not really apprehend the approach of any such thing myself
and as judge douglas seems to be in constant horror that some such danger is rapidly approaching
i propose as the best means to prevent it that the judge be kept at home
and placed in the state legislature to fight the measure
i do not propose dwelling longer at this time on this subject
when judge trumbull
our other senator in congress
returned to illinois in the month of august
he made a speech at chicago
in which he made what may be called a charge against judge douglas
which i understand proved to be very offensive to him
the judge was at that time out upon one of his speaking tours through the country
and when the news of it reached him
as i am informed
he denounced judge trumbull in rather harsh terms for having said what he did in regard to that matter
i was traveling at that time
and speaking at the same places with judge douglas on subsequent days
and when i heard of what judge trumbull had said of douglas
and what douglas had said back again
i felt that i was in a position where i could not remain entirely silent in regard to the matter
upon two or three occasions i alluded to it
and alluded to it in no other wise than to say that in regard to the charge brought by trumbull against douglas
i personally knew nothing
and sought to say nothing about it that i did personally know judge trumbull that i believed him to be a man of veracity that i believed him to be a man of capacity sufficient to know very well whether an assertion he was making
as a conclusion drawn from a set of facts
was true or false and as a conclusion of my own from that
i stated it as my belief if trumbull should ever be called upon
he would prove everything he had said
i said this upon two or three occasions
upon a subsequent occasion
judge trumbull spoke again before an audience at alton
and upon that occasion not only repeated his charge against douglas
but arrayed the evidence he relied upon to substantiate it
this speech was published at length and subsequently at jacksonville judge douglas alluded to the matter
in the course of his speech
and near the close of it
he stated in regard to myself what i will now read
judge douglas proceeded to remark that he should not hereafter occupy his time in refuting such charges made by trumbull
but that
lincoln having indorsed the character of trumbull for veracity
he should hold him lincoln responsible for the slanders
i have done simply what i have told you
to subject me to this invitation to notice the charge
i now wish to say that it had not originally been my purpose to discuss that matter at all but in as much as it seems to be the wish of judge douglas to hold me responsible for it
then for once in my life i will play general jackson
and to the just extent i take the responsibility
i wish to say at the beginning that i will hand to the reporters that portion of judge trumbull's alton speech which was devoted to this matter
and also that portion of judge douglas's speech made at jacksonville in answer to it
i shall thereby furnish the readers of this debate with the complete discussion between trumbull and douglas
i cannot now read them
for the reason that it would take half of my first hour to do so
i can only make some comments upon them
trumbull's charge is in the following words
the charge is
that there was a plot entered into to have a constitution formed for kansas
and put in force
without giving the people an opportunity to vote upon it
and that mr
douglas was in the plot
i will state
without quoting further
for all will have an opportunity of reading it hereafter
that judge trumbull brings forward what he regards as sufficient evidence to substantiate this charge
it will be perceived judge trumbull shows that senator bigler
upon the floor of the senate
had declared there had been a conference among the senators
in which conference it was determined to have an enabling act passed for the people of kansas to form a constitution under
and in this conference it was agreed among them that it was best not to have a provision for submitting the constitution to a vote of the people after it should be formed
he then brings forward to show
and showing
as he deemed
that judge douglas reported the bill back to the senate with that clause stricken out
he then shows that there was a new clause inserted into the bill
which would in its nature prevent a reference of the constitution back for a vote of the people
upon a mere silence in the law
it could be assumed that they had the right to vote upon it
these are the general statements that he has made
i propose to examine the points in judge douglas's speech in which he attempts to answer that speech of judge trumbull's
when you come to examine judge douglas's speech
you will find that the first point he makes is
suppose it were true that there was such a change in the bill
and that i struck it out
is that a proof of a plot to force a constitution upon them against their will
his striking out such a provision
if there was such a one in the bill
he argues
does not establish the proof that it was stricken out for the purpose of robbing the people of that right
i would say
in the first place
that that would be a most manifest reason for it
it is true
as judge douglas states
that many territorial bills have passed without having such a provision in them
i believe it is true
though i am not certain
that in some instances constitutions framed under such bills have been submitted to a vote of the people with the law silent upon the subject but it does not appear that they once had their enabling acts framed with an express provision for submitting the constitution to be framed to a vote of the people
then that they were stricken out when congress did not mean to alter the effect of the law
that there have been bills which never had the provision in
i do not question but when was that provision taken out of one that it was in
more especially does the evidence tend to prove the proposition that trumbull advanced
when we remember that the provision was stricken out of the bill almost simultaneously with the time that bigler says there was a conference among certain senators
and in which it was agreed that a bill should be passed leaving that out
judge douglas
in answering trumbull
omits to attend to the testimony of bigler
that there was a meeting in which it was agreed they should so frame the bill that there should be no submission of the constitution to a vote of the people
the judge does not notice this part of it
if you take this as one piece of evidence
and then ascertain that simultaneously judge douglas struck out a provision that did require it to be submitted
and put the two together
i think it will make a pretty fair show of proof that judge douglas did
as trumbull says
enter into a plot to put in force a constitution for kansas
without giving the people any opportunity of voting upon it
but i must hurry on
the next proposition that judge douglas puts is this
but upon examination it turns out that the toombs bill never did contain a clause requiring the constitution to be submitted
this is a mere question of fact
and can be determined by evidence
i only want to ask this question
why did not judge douglas say that these words were not stricken out of the toomb's bill
or this bill from which it is alleged the provision was stricken out
a bill which goes by the name of toomb's
because he originally brought it forward
i ask why
if the judge wanted to make a direct issue with trumbull
did he not take the exact proposition trumbull made in his speech
and say it was not stricken out
trumbull has given the exact words that he says were in the toomb's bill
and he alleges that when the bill came back
they were stricken out
judge douglas does not say that the words which trumbull says were stricken out were not so stricken out
but he says there was no provision in the toomb's bill to submit the constitution to a vote of the people
we see at once that he is merely making an issue upon the meaning of the words
he has not undertaken to say that trumbull tells a lie about these words being stricken out
but he is really
when pushed up to it
only taking an issue upon the meaning of the words
if there be any issue upon the meaning of the words
or if there be upon the question of fact as to whether these words were stricken out
i have before me what i suppose to be a genuine copy of the toomb's bill
in which it can be shown that the words trumbull says were in it were
in fact
originally there
if there be any dispute upon the fact
i have got the documents here to show they were there
if there be any controversy upon the sense of the words
whether these words which were stricken out really constituted a provision for submitting the matter to a vote of the people
as that is a matter of argument
i think i may as well use trumbull's own argument
he says that the proposition is in these words
that the following propositions be and the same are hereby offered to the said convention of the people of kansas when formed
for their free acceptance or rejection which
if accepted by the convention and ratified by the people at the election for the adoption of the constitution
shall be obligatory upon the united states and the said state of kansas
now
trumbull alleges that these last words were stricken out of the bill when it came back
and he says this was a provision for submitting the constitution to a vote of the people and his argument is this
would it have been possible to ratify the land propositions at the election for the adoption of the constitution
unless such an election was to be held
this is trumbull's argument
judge douglas does not meet the charge at all
but he stands up and says there was no such proposition in that bill for submitting the constitution to be framed to a vote of the people
trumbull admits that the language is not a direct provision for submitting it
but it is a provision necessarily implied from another provision
he asks you how it is possible to ratify the land proposition at the election for the adoption of the constitution
if there was no election to be held for the adoption of the constitution
and he goes on to show that it is not any less a law because the provision is put in that indirect shape than it would be if it were put directly
but i presume i have said enough to draw attention to this point
and i pass it by also
another one of the points that judge douglas makes upon trumbull
and at very great length
that trumbull
while the bill was pending
said in a speech in the senate that he supposed the constitution to be made would have to be submitted to the people
he asks
if trumbull thought so then
what ground is there for anybody thinking otherwise now
this much may be said in reply
that bill had been in the hands of a party to which trumbull did not belong
it had been in the hands of the committee at the head of which judge douglas stood
trumbull perhaps had a printed copy of the original toomb's bill
i have not the evidence on that point except a sort of inference i draw from the general course of business there
what alterations
or what provisions in the way of altering
were going on in committee
trumbull had no means of knowing
until the altered bill was reported back
soon afterwards
when it was reported back
there was a discussion over it
and perhaps trumbull in reading it hastily in the altered form did not perceive all the bearings of the alterations
he was hastily borne into the debate
and it does not follow that because there was something in it trumbull did not perceive
that something did not exist
more than this
is it true that what trumbull did can have any effect on what douglas did
suppose trumbull had been in the plot with these other men
would that let douglas out of it
would it exonerate douglas that trumbull did n't then perceive he was in the plot
he also asks the question
why did n't trumbull propose to amend the bill
if he thought it needed any amendment
i believe that everything judge trumbull had proposed
particularly in connection with this question of kansas and nebraska
since he had been on the floor of the senate
had been promptly voted down by judge douglas and his friends
he had no promise that an amendment offered by him to anything on this subject would receive the slightest consideration
judge trumbull did bring to the notice of the senate at that time the fact that there was no provision for submitting the constitution about to be made for the people of kansas to a vote of the people
i believe i may venture to say that judge douglas made some reply to this speech of judge trumbull's
but he never noticed that part of it at all
and so the thing passed by
i think
the fact that judge trumbull offered no amendment does not throw much blame upon him and if it did
it does not reach the question of fact as to what judge douglas was doing
i repeat
that if trumbull had himself been in the plot
it would not at all relieve the others who were in it from blame
if i should be indicted for murder
and upon the trial it should be discovered that i had been implicated in that murder
but that the prosecuting witness was guilty too
that would not at all touch the question of my crime
it would be no relief to my neck that they discovered this other man who charged the crime upon me to be guilty too
another one of the points judge douglas makes upon judge trumbull is
that when he spoke in chicago he made his charge to rest upon the fact that the bill had the provision in it for submitting the constitution to a vote of the people when it went into his judge douglas's hands
that it was missing when he reported it to the senate
and that in a public speech he had subsequently said the alterations in the bill were made while it was in committee
and that they were made in consultation between him judge douglas and toomb's
and judge douglas goes on to comment upon the fact of trumbull's adducing in his alton speech the proposition that the bill not only came back with that proposition stricken out
but with another clause and another provision in it
saying that until the complete execution of this act there shall be no election in said territory
trumbull argued
was not only taking the provision for submitting to a vote of the people out of the bill
but was adding an affirmative one
in that it prevented the people from exercising the right under a bill that was merely silent on the question
in regard to what he says
that trumbull shifts the issue
that he shifts his ground
and i believe he uses the term that
it being proven false
he has changed ground
i call upon all of you
when you come to examine that portion of trumbull's speech for it will make a part of mine
to examine whether trumbull has shifted his ground or not
i say he did not shift his ground
but that he brought forward his original charge and the evidence to sustain it yet more fully
but precisely as he originally made it
in addition thereto
he brought in a new piece of evidence
he shifted no ground
he brought no new piece of evidence inconsistent with his former testimony but he brought a new piece
as he thought
and as i think
to prove his proposition
to illustrate
a man brings an accusation against another
and on trial the man making the charge introduces a and b to prove the accusation
at a second trial he introduces the same witnesses
who tell the same story as before
and a third witness
who tells the same thing
and in addition gives further testimony corroborative of the charge
so with trumbull
there was no shifting of ground
nor inconsistency of testimony between the new piece of evidence and what he originally introduced
but judge douglas says that he himself moved to strike out that last provision of the bill
and that on his motion it was stricken out and a substitute inserted
that i presume is the truth
i presume it is true that that last proposition was stricken out by judge douglas
trumbull has not said it was not trumbull has himself said that it was so stricken out
he says
i am now speaking of the bill as judge douglas reported it back
it was amended somewhat in the senate before it passed
but i am speaking of it as he brought it back
now
when judge douglas parades the fact that the provision was stricken out of the bill when it came back
he asserts nothing contrary to what trumbull alleges
trumbull has only said that he originally put it in
not that he did not strike it out
trumbull says it was not in the bill when it went to the committee
when it came back it was in
and judge douglas said the alterations were made by him in consultation with toomb's
trumbull alleges
as his conclusion
that judge douglas put it in
if douglas wants to contradict trumbull and call him a liar
let him say he did not put it in
and not that he did n't take it out again
it is said that a bear is sometimes hard enough pushed to drop a cub and so i presume it was in this case
i presume the truth is that douglas put it in
and afterward took it out
i take it
is the truth about it
judge trumbull says one thing
douglas says another thing
and the two don't contradict one another at all
the question is
what did he put it in for
in the first place
what did he take the other provision out of the bill for
the provision which trumbull argued was necessary for submitting the constitution to a vote of the people
what did he take that out for and
having taken it out
what did he put this in for
i say that in the run of things it is not unlikely forces conspire to render it vastly expedient for judge douglas to take that latter clause out again
the question that trumbull has made is that judge douglas put it in and he don't meet trumbull at all unless he denies that
in the clause of judge douglas's speech upon this subject he uses this language toward judge trumbull
he says
he forges his evidence from beginning to end and by falsifying the record
he endeavors to bolster up his false charge
well
that is a pretty serious statement trumbull forges his evidence from beginning to end
upon my own authority i say that it is not true
what is a forgery
consider the evidence that trumbull has brought forward
when you come to read the speech
as you will be able to
examine whether the evidence is a forgery from beginning to end
he had the bill or document in his hand like that holding up a paper
he says that is a copy of the toomb's bill
the amendment offered by toomb's
he says that is a copy of the bill as it was introduced and went into judge douglas's hands
does judge douglas say that is a forgery
that is one thing trumbull brought forward
judge douglas says he forged it from beginning to end
that is the beginning
we will say
does douglas say that is a forgery
let him say it to day
and we will have a subsequent examination upon this subject
trumbull then holds up another document like this
and says that is an exact copy of the bill as it came back in the amended form out of judge douglas's hands
does judge douglas say that is a forgery
does he say it in his general sweeping charge
does he say so now
if he does not
then take this toomb's bill and the bill in the amended form
and it only needs to compare them to see that the provision is in the one and not in the other it leaves the inference inevitable that it was taken out
while i am dealing with this question
let us see what trumbull's other evidence is
one other piece of evidence i will read
trumbull says there are in this original toomb's bill these words
that the following propositions be and the same are hereby offered to the said convention of the people of kansas
when formed
for their free acceptance or rejection which
if accepted by the convention and ratified by the people at the election for the adoption of the constitution
shall be obligatory upon the united states and the said state of kansas
now
if it is said that this is a forgery
we will open the paper here and see whether it is or not
trumbull says
as he goes along
that mr
bigler made the following statement in his place in the senate
december 9
i was present when that subject was discussed by senators before the bill was introduced
and the question was raised and discussed
whether the constitution
when formed
should be submitted to a vote of the people
it was held by those most intelligent on the subject that
in view of all the difficulties surrounding that territory
the danger of any experiment at that time of a popular vote
it would be better there should be no such provision in the toomb's bill and it was my understanding
in all the intercourse i had
that the convention would make a constitution
and send it here
without submitting it to the popular vote
then trumbull follows on
in speaking of this meeting again on the 21st december
1857 congressional globe
same vol
page 113
senator bigler said
nothing was further from my mind than to allude to any social or confidential interview
the meeting was not of that character
it was semi official
and called to promote the public good
my recollection was clear that i left the conference under the impression that it had been deemed best to adopt measures to admit kansas as a state through the agency of one popular election
and that for delegates to this convention
this impression was stronger because i thought the spirit of the bill infringed upon the doctrine of non intervention
to which i had great aversion but with the hope of accomplishing a great good
and as no movement had been made in that direction in the territory
i waived this objection
and concluded to support the measure
i have a few items of testimony as to the correctness of these impressions
and with their submission i shall be content
i have before me the bill reported by the senator from illinois on the 7th of march
providing for the admission of kansas as a state
the third section of which reads as follows
that the following propositions be
and the same are hereby offered to the said convention of the people of kansas
when formed
for their free acceptance or rejection which
if accepted by the convention and ratified by the people at the election for the adoption of the constitution
shall be obligatory upon the united states and the said state of kansas
the bill read in his place by the senator from georgia on the 25th of june
and referred to the committee on territories
contained the same section word for word
both these bills were under consideration at the conference referred to but
when the senator from illinois reported the toombs bill to the senate with amendments
the next morning
it did not contain that portion of the third section which indicated to the convention that the constitution should be approved by the people
the words and ratified by the people at the election for the adoption of the constitution had been stricken out
these things trumbull says were stated by bigler upon the floor of the senate on certain days
and that they are recorded in the congressional globe on certain pages
does judge douglas say this is a forgery
does he say there is no such thing in the congressional globe
what does he mean when he says judge trumbull forges his evidence from beginning to end
so again he says in another place that judge douglas
in his speech
december 9
1857 congressional globe
part i
page 15
that during the last session of congress
i mr
douglas reported a bill from the committee on territories
to authorize the people of kansas to assemble and form a constitution for themselves
subsequently the senator from georgia mr
toombs brought forward a substitute for my bill
after having been modified by him and myself in consultation
was passed by the senate
now
trumbull says this is a quotation from a speech of douglas
and is recorded in the congressional globe
is it a forgery
is it there or not
it may not be there
but i want the judge to take these pieces of evidence
and distinctly say they are forgeries if he dare do it
a voice
he will
well
you had better not commit him
he gives other quotations
another from judge douglas
he says
i will ask the senator to show me an intimation
from any one member of the senate
in the whole debate on the toombs bill
and in the union
from any quarter
that the constitution was not to be submitted to the people
i will venture to say that on all sides of the chamber it was so understood at the time
if the opponents of the bill had understood it was not
they would have made the point on it and if they had made it
we should certainly have yielded to it
and put in the clause
that is a discovery made since the president found out that it was not safe to take it for granted that that would be done
which ought in fairness to have been done
judge trumbull says douglas made that speech
and it is recorded
does judge douglas say it is a forgery
and was not true
trumbull says somewhere
and i propose to skip it
but it will be found by any one who will read this debate
that he did distinctly bring it to the notice of those who were engineering the bill
that it lacked that provision and then he goes on to give another quotation from judge douglas
where judge trumbull uses this language
judge douglas
on the same day and in the same debate
probably recollecting or being reminded of the fact that i had objected to the toombs bill when pending that it did not provide for a submission of the constitution to the people
made another statement
which is to be found in the same volume of the globe
page 22
in which he says
that the bill was silent on this subject was true
and my attention was called to that about the time it was passed and i took the fair construction to be
that powers not delegated were reserved
and that of course the constitution would be submitted to the people
 whether this statement is consistent with the statement just before made
that had the point been made it would have been yielded to
or that it was a new discovery
you will determine
so i say
i do not know whether judge douglas will dispute this
and yet maintain his position that trumbull's evidence was forged from beginning to end
i will remark that i have not got these congressional globes with me
they are large books
and difficult to carry about
and if judge douglas shall say that on these points where trumbull has quoted from them there are no such passages there
i shall not be able to prove they are there upon this occasion
but i will have another chance
whenever he points out the forgery and says
i declare that this particular thing which trumbull has uttered is not to be found where he says it is
then my attention will be drawn to that
and i will arm myself for the contest
stating now that i have not the slightest doubt on earth that i will find every quotation just where trumbull says it is
then the question is
how can douglas call that a forgery
how can he make out that it is a forgery
what is a forgery
it is the bringing forward something in writing or in print purporting to be of certain effect when it is altogether untrue
if you come forward with my note for one hundred dollars when i have never given such a note
there is a forgery
if you come forward with a letter purporting to be written by me which i never wrote
there is another forgery
if you produce anything in writing or in print saying it is so and so
the document not being genuine
a forgery has been committed
how do you make this forgery when every piece of the evidence is genuine
if judge douglas does say these documents and quotations are false and forged
he has a full right to do so but until he does it specifically
we don't know how to get at him
if he does say they are false and forged
i will then look further into it
and presume i can procure the certificates of the proper officers that they are genuine copies
i have no doubt each of these extracts will be found exactly where trumbull says it is
then i leave it to you if judge douglas
in making his sweeping charge that judge trumbull's evidence is forged from beginning to end
at all meets the case
if that is the way to get at the facts
i repeat again
if he will point out which one is a forgery
i will carefully examine it
and if it proves that any one of them is really a forgery
it will not be me who will hold to it any longer
i have always wanted to deal with everyone i meet candidly and honestly
if i have made any assertion not warranted by facts
and it is pointed out to me
i will withdraw it cheerfully
but i do not choose to see judge trumbull calumniated
and the evidence he has brought forward branded in general terms a forgery from beginning to end
this is not the legal way of meeting a charge
and i submit it to all intelligent persons
both friends of judge douglas and of myself
whether it is
the point upon judge douglas is this
the bill that went into his hands had the provision in it for a submission of the constitution to the people and i say its language amounts to an express provision for a submission
and that he took the provision out
he says it was known that the bill was silent in this particular but i say
judge douglas
it was not silent when you got it
it was vocal with the declaration
when you got it
for a submission of the constitution to the people
and now
my direct question to judge douglas is
to answer why
if he deemed the bill silent on this point
he found it necessary to strike out those particular harmless words
if he had found the bill silent and without this provision
he might say what he does now
if he supposes it was implied that the constitution would be submitted to a vote of the people
how could these two lines so encumber the statute as to make it necessary to strike them out
how could he infer that a submission was still implied
after its express provision had been stricken from the bill
i find the bill vocal with the provision
while he silenced it
he took it out
and although he took out the other provision preventing a submission to a vote of the people
i ask
why did you first put it in
i ask him whether he took the original provision out
which trumbull alleges was in the bill
if he admits that he did take it
i ask him what he did it for
it looks to us as if he had altered the bill
if it looks differently to him
if he has a different reason for his action from the one we assign him he can tell it
i insist upon knowing why he made the bill silent upon that point when it was vocal before he put his hands upon it
i was told
before my last paragraph
that my time was within three minutes of being out
i presume it is expired now i therefore close
lincoln's rejoinder
it follows as a matter of course that a half hour answer to a speech of an hour and a half can be but a very hurried one
i shall only be able to touch upon a few of the points suggested by judge douglas
and give them a brief attention
while i shall have to totally omit others for the want of time
judge douglas has said to you that he has not been able to get from me an answer to the question whether i am in favor of negro citizenship
so far as i know the judge never asked me the question before
he shall have no occasion to ever ask it again
for i tell him very frankly that i am not in favor of negro citizenship
this furnishes me an occasion for saying a few words upon the subject
i mentioned in a certain speech of mine
which has been printed
that the supreme court had decided that a negro could not possibly be made a citizen and without saying what was my ground of complaint in regard to that
or whether i had any ground of complaint
judge douglas has from that thing manufactured nearly everything that he ever says about my disposition to produce an equality between the negroes and the white people
if any one will read my speech
he will find i mentioned that as one of the points decided in the course of the supreme court opinions
but i did not state what objection i had to it
but judge douglas tells the people what my objection was when i did not tell them myself
my opinion is that the different states have the power to make a negro a citizen under the constitution of the united states if they choose
the dred scott decision decides that they have not that power
if the state of illinois had that power
i should be opposed to the exercise of it
that is all i have to say about it
judge douglas has told me that he heard my speeches north and my speeches south that he had heard me at ottawa and at freeport in the north and recently at jonesboro in the south
and there was a very different cast of sentiment in the speeches made at the different points
i will not charge upon judge douglas that he wilfully misrepresents me
but i call upon every fair minded man to take these speeches and read them
and i dare him to point out any difference between my speeches north and south
while i am here perhaps i ought to say a word
if i have the time
in regard to the latter portion of the judge's speech
which was a sort of declamation in reference to my having said i entertained the belief that this government would not endure half slave and half free
i have said so
and i did not say it without what seemed to me to be good reasons
it perhaps would require more time than i have now to set forth these reasons in detail but let me ask you a few questions
have we ever had any peace on this slavery question
when are we to have peace upon it
if it is kept in the position it now occupies
how are we ever to have peace upon it
that is an important question
to be sure
if we will all stop
and allow judge douglas and his friends to march on in their present career until they plant the institution all over the nation
here and wherever else our flag waves
and we acquiesce in it
there will be peace
but let me ask judge douglas how he is going to get the people to do that
they have been wrangling over this question for at least forty years
this was the cause of the agitation resulting in the missouri compromise this produced the troubles at the annexation of texas
in the acquisition of the territory acquired in the mexican war
this was the trouble which was quieted by the compromise of 1850
when it was settled forever as both the great political parties declared in their national conventions
that forever turned out to be just four years
when judge douglas himself reopened it
when is it likely to come to an end
he introduced the nebraska bill in 1854 to put another end to the slavery agitation
he promised that it would finish it all up immediately
and he has never made a speech since
until he got into a quarrel with the president about the lecompton constitution
in which he has not declared that we are just at the end of the slavery agitation
but in one speech
i think last winter
he did say that he did n't quite see when the end of the slavery agitation would come
now he tells us again that it is all over and the people of kansas have voted down the lecompton constitution
how is it over
that was only one of the attempts at putting an end to the slavery agitation one of these final settlements
is kansas in the union
has she formed a constitution that she is likely to come in under
is not the slavery agitation still an open question in that territory
has the voting down of that constitution put an end to all the trouble
is that more likely to settle it than every one of these previous attempts to settle the slavery agitation
at this day in the history of the world we can no more foretell where the end of this slavery agitation will be than we can see the end of the world itself
the nebraska kansas bill was introduced four years and a half ago
and if the agitation is ever to come to an end we may say we are four years and a half nearer the end
we can say we are four years and a half nearer the end of the world
and we can just as clearly see the end of the world as we can see the end of this agitation
the kansas settlement did not conclude it
if kansas should sink to day
and leave a great vacant space in the earth's surface
this vexed question would still be among us
i say
there is no way of putting an end to the slavery agitation amongst us but to put it back upon the basis where our fathers placed it no way but to keep it out of our new territories
to restrict it forever to the old states where it now exists
then the public mind will rest in the belief that it is in the course of ultimate extinction
that is one way of putting an end to the slavery agitation
the other way is for us to surrender and let judge douglas and his friends have their way and plant slavery over all the states cease speaking of it as in any way a wrong regard slavery as one of the common matters of property
and speak of negroes as we do of our horses and cattle
but while it drives on in its state of progress as it is now driving
and as it has driven for the last five years
i have ventured the opinion
and i say to day
that we will have no end to the slavery agitation until it takes one turn or the other
i do not mean that when it takes a turn toward ultimate extinction it will be in a day
nor in a year
nor in two years
i do not suppose that in the most peaceful way ultimate extinction would occur in less than a hundred years at least but that it will occur in the best way for both races
in god's own good time
i have no doubt
my friends
i have used up more of my time than i intended on this point
in regard to this matter about trumbull and myself having made a bargain to sell out the entire whig and democratic parties in 1854
judge douglas brings forward no evidence to sustain his charge
except the speech matheny is said to have made in 1856
in which he told a cock and bull story of that sort
upon the same moral principles that judge douglas tells it here to day
this is the simple truth
i do not care greatly for the story
but this is the truth of it
and i have twice told judge douglas to his face that from beginning to end there is not one word of truth in it
i have called upon him for the proof
and he does not at all meet me as trumbull met him upon that of which we were just talking
by producing the record
he did n't bring the record because there was no record for him to bring
when he asks if i am ready to indorse trumbull's veracity after he has broken a bargain with me
i reply that if trumbull had broken a bargain with me i would not be likely to indorse his veracity but i am ready to indorse his veracity because neither in that thing
nor in any other
in all the years that i have known lyman trumbull
have i known him to fail of his word or tell a falsehood large or small
it is for that reason that i indorse lyman trumbull
james brown douglas postmaster
what does ford's history say about him
some gentleman asks me what ford's history says about him
my own recollection is that ford speaks of trumbull in very disrespectful terms in several portions of his book
and that he talks a great deal worse of judge douglas
i refer you
to the history for examination
judge douglas complains at considerable length about a disposition on the part of trumbull and myself to attack him personally
i want to attend to that suggestion a moment
i don't want to be unjustly accused of dealing illiberally or unfairly with an adversary
either in court or in a political canvass or anywhere else
i would despise myself if i supposed myself ready to deal less liberally with an adversary than i was willing to be treated myself
judge douglas in a general way
without putting it in a direct shape
revives the old charge against me in reference to the mexican war
he does not take the responsibility of putting it in a very definite form
but makes a general reference to it
that charge is more than ten years old
he complains of trumbull and myself because he says we bring charges against him one or two years old
he knows
that in regard to the mexican war story the more respectable papers of his own party throughout the state have been compelled to take it back and acknowledge that it was a lie
here mr
lincoln turned to the crowd on the platform
selecting hon
orlando b
led him forward and said
i do not mean to do anything with mr
ficklin except to present his face and tell you that he personally knows it to be a lie
he was a member of congress at the only time i was in congress
and ficklin knows that whenever there was an attempt to procure a vote of mine which would indorse the origin and justice of the war
i refused to give such indorsement and voted against it but i never voted against the supplies for the army
and he knows
as well as judge douglas
that whenever a dollar was asked by way of compensation or otherwise for the benefit of the soldiers i gave all the votes that ficklin or douglas did
and perhaps more
my friends
i wish to say this in reference to the matter
lincoln and myself are just as good personal friends as judge douglas and myself
in reference to this mexican war
my recollection is that when ashmun's resolution amendment was offered by mr
ashmun of massachusetts
in which he declared that the mexican war was unnecessary and unconstitutionally commenced by the president my recollection is that mr
lincoln voted for that resolution
that is the truth
you all remember that was a resolution censuring the president for the manner in which the war was begun
you know they have charged that i voted against the supplies
by which i starved the soldiers who were out fighting the battles of their country
i say that ficklin knows it is false
when that charge was brought forward by the chicago times
the springfield register douglas's organ reminded the times that the charge really applied to john henry and i do know that john henry is now making speeches and fiercely battling for judge douglas
if the judge now says that he offers this as a sort of setoff to what i said to day in reference to trumbull's charge
then i remind him that he made this charge before i said a word about trumbull's
he brought this forward at ottawa
the first time we met face to face and in the opening speech that judge douglas made he attacked me in regard to a matter ten years old
is n't he a pretty man to be whining about people making charges against him only two years old
the judge thinks it is altogether wrong that i should have dwelt upon this charge of trumbull's at all
i gave the apology for doing so in my opening speech
perhaps it did n't fix your attention
i said that when judge douglas was speaking at place where i spoke on the succeeding day he used very harsh language about this charge
two or three times afterward i said i had confidence in judge trumbull's veracity and intelligence and my own opinion was
from what i knew of the character of judge trumbull
that he would vindicate his position and prove whatever he had stated to be true
this i repeated two or three times and then i dropped it
without saying anything more on the subject for weeks perhaps a month
i passed it by without noticing it at all till i found
at jacksonville
judge douglas in the plenitude of his power is not willing to answer trumbull and let me alone
but he comes out there and uses this language
he should not hereafter occupy his time in refuting such charges made by trumbull but that
lincoln having indorsed the character of trumbull for veracity
he should hold him lincoln responsible for the slanders
what was lincoln to do
did he not do right
when he had the fit opportunity of meeting judge douglas here
to tell him he was ready for the responsibility
i ask a candid audience whether in doing thus judge douglas was not the assailant rather than i
here i meet him face to face
and say i am ready to take the responsibility
so far as it rests on me
having done so i ask the attention of this audience to the question whether i have succeeded in sustaining the charge
and whether judge douglas has at all succeeded in rebutting it
you all heard me call upon him to say which of these pieces of evidence was a forgery
does he say that what i present here as a copy of the original toombs bill is a forgery
does he say that what i present as a copy of the bill reported by himself is a forgery
or what is presented as a transcript from the globe of the quotations from bigler's speech is a forgery
does he say the quotations from his own speech are forgeries
does he say this transcript from trumbull's speech is a forgery
he didn't deny one of them
i would then like to know how it comes about that when each piece of a story is true the whole story turns out false
i take it these people have some sense they see plainly that judge douglas is playing cuttle fish
a small species of fish that has no mode of defending itself when pursued except by throwing out a black fluid
which makes the water so dark the enemy cannot see it
and thus it escapes
ain't the judge playing the cuttle fish
i would ask very special attention to the consideration of judge douglas's speech at jacksonville and when you shall read his speech of to day
i ask you to watch closely and see which of these pieces of testimony
every one of which he says is a forgery
he has shown to be such
not one of them has he shown to be a forgery
then i ask the original question
if each of the pieces of testimony is true
how is it possible that the whole is a falsehood
in regard to trumbull's charge that he douglas inserted a provision into the bill to prevent the constitution being submitted to the people
what was his answer
he comes here and reads from the congressional globe to show that on his motion that provision was struck out of the bill
trumbull has not said it was not stricken out
but trumbull says he douglas put it in and it is no answer to the charge to say he afterwards took it out
both are perhaps true
it was in regard to that thing precisely that i told him he had dropped the cub
trumbull shows you that by his introducing the bill it was his cub
it is no answer to that assertion to call trumbull a liar merely because he did not specially say that douglas struck it out
suppose that were the case
does it answer trumbull
i assert that you pointing to an individual are here to day
and you undertake to prove me a liar by showing that you were in mattoon yesterday
i say that you took your hat off your head
and you prove me a liar by putting it on your head
that is the whole force of douglas's argument
i want to come back to my original question
trumbull says that judge douglas had a bill with a provision in it for submitting a constitution to be made to a vote of the people of kansas
does judge douglas deny that fact
does he deny that the provision which trumbull reads was put in that bill
then trumbull says he struck it out
does he dare to deny that
he does not
and i have the right to repeat the question
why judge douglas took it out
bigler has said there was a combination of certain senators
among whom he did not include judge douglas
by which it was agreed that the kansas bill should have a clause in it not to have the constitution formed under it submitted to a vote of the people
he did not say that douglas was among them
but we prove by another source that about the same time douglas comes into the senate with that provision stricken out of the bill
although bigler cannot say they were all working in concert
yet it looks very much as if the thing was agreed upon and done with a mutual understanding after the conference and while we do not know that it was absolutely so
yet it looks so probable that we have a right to call upon the man who knows the true reason why it was done to tell what the true reason was
when he will not tell what the true reason was
he stands in the attitude of an accused thief who has stolen goods in his possession
and when called to account refuses to tell where he got them
not only is this the evidence
but when he comes in with the bill having the provision stricken out
he tells us in a speech
not then but since
that these alterations and modifications in the bill had been made by him
in consultation with toombs
the originator of the bill
he tells us the same to day
he says there were certain modifications made in the bill in committee that he did not vote for
i ask you to remember
while certain amendments were made which he disapproved of
but which a majority of the committee voted in
he has himself told us that in this particular the alterations and modifications were made by him
upon consultation with toombs
we have his own word that these alterations were made by him
and not by the committee
i ask
what is the reason judge douglas is so chary about coming to the exact question
what is the reason he will not tell you anything about how it was made
by whom it was made
or that he remembers it being made at all
why does he stand playing upon the meaning of words and quibbling around the edges of the evidence
if he can explain all this
but leaves it unexplained
i have the right to infer that judge douglas understood it was the purpose of his party
in engineering that bill through
to make a constitution
and have kansas come into the union with that constitution
without its being submitted to a vote of the people
if he will explain his action on this question
by giving a better reason for the facts that happened than he has done
it will be satisfactory
but until he does that until he gives a better or more plausible reason than he has offered against the evidence in the case i suggest to him it will not avail him at all that he swells himself up
takes on dignity
and calls people liars
there is not a word in trumbull's speech that depends on trumbull's veracity at all
he has only arrayed the evidence and told you what follows as a matter of reasoning
there is not a statement in the whole speech that depends on trumbull's word
if you have ever studied geometry
you remember that by a course of reasoning euclid proves that all the angles in a triangle are equal to two right angles
euclid has shown you how to work it out
if you undertake to disprove that proposition
and to show that it is erroneous
would you prove it to be false by calling euclid a liar
they tell me that my time is out
and therefore i close
fifth joint debate
at galesburgh
october 7
1858 mr
lincoln's reply
my fellow citizens
a very large portion of the speech which judge douglas has addressed to you has previously been delivered and put in print
i do not mean that for a hit upon the judge at all
if i had not been interrupted
i was going to say that such an answer as i was able to make to a very large portion of it had already been more than once made and published
there has been an opportunity afforded to the public to see our respective views upon the topics discussed in a large portion of the speech which he has just delivered
i make these remarks for the purpose of excusing myself for not passing over the entire ground that the judge has traversed
i however desire to take up some of the points that he has attended to
and ask your attention to them
and i shall follow him backwards upon some notes which i have taken
reversing the order
by beginning where he concluded
the judge has alluded to the declaration of independence
and insisted that negroes are not included in that declaration and that it is a slander upon the framers of that instrument to suppose that negroes were meant therein and he asks you
is it possible to believe that mr
who penned the immortal paper
could have supposed himself applying the language of that instrument to the negro race
and yet held a portion of that race in slavery
would he not at once have freed them
i only have to remark upon this part of the judge's speech and that
very briefly
for i shall not detain myself
or you
upon that point for any great length of time
that i believe the entire records of the world
from the date of the declaration of independence up to within three years ago
may be searched in vain for one single affirmation
from one single man
that the negro was not included in the declaration of independence i think i may defy judge douglas to show that he ever said so
that washington ever said so
that any president ever said so
that any member of congress ever said so
or that any living man upon the whole earth ever said so
until the necessities of the present policy of the democratic party
in regard to slavery
had to invent that affirmation
and i will remind judge douglas and this audience that while mr
jefferson was the owner of slaves
as undoubtedly he was
in speaking upon this very subject he used the strong language that he trembled for his country when he remembered that god was just and i will offer the highest premium in my power to judge douglas if he will show that he
in all his life
ever uttered a sentiment at all akin to that of jefferson
the next thing to which i will ask your attention is the judge's comments upon the fact
as he assumes it to be
that we cannot call our public meetings as republican meetings and he instances tazewell county as one of the places where the friends of lincoln have called a public meeting and have not dared to name it a republican meeting
he instances monroe county as another
where judge trumbull and jehu baker addressed the persons whom the judge assumes to be the friends of lincoln calling them the free democracy
i have the honor to inform judge douglas that he spoke in that very county of tazewell last saturday
and i was there on tuesday last and when he spoke there
he spoke under a call not venturing to use the word democrat
turning to judge douglas
what think you of this
there is another thing to which i would ask the judge's attention upon this subject
in the contest of 1856 his party delighted to call themselves together as the national democracy but now
if there should be a notice put up anywhere for a meeting of the national democracy
judge douglas and his friends would not come
they would not suppose themselves invited
they would understand that it was a call for those hateful postmasters whom he talks about
now a few words in regard to these extracts from speeches of mine which judge douglas has read to you
and which he supposes are in very great contrast to each other
those speeches have been before the public for a considerable time
and if they have any inconsistency in them
if there is any conflict in them
the public have been able to detect it
when the judge says
in speaking on this subject
that i make speeches of one sort for the people of the northern end of the state
and of a different sort for the southern people
he assumes that i do not understand that my speeches will be put in print and read north and south
i knew all the while that the speech that i made at chicago
and the one i made at jonesboro and the one at charleston
would all be put in print
and all the reading and intelligent men in the community would see them and know all about my opinions
and i have not supposed
and do not now suppose
that there is any conflict whatever between them
but the judge will have it that if we do not confess that there is a sort of inequality between the white and black races which justifies us in making them slaves
we must then insist that there is a degree of equality that requires us to make them our wives
i have all the while taken a broad distinction in regard to that matter and that is all there is in these different speeches which he arrays here and the entire reading of either of the speeches will show that that distinction was made
perhaps by taking two parts of the same speech he could have got up as much of a conflict as the one he has found
i have all the while maintained that in so far as it should be insisted that there was an equality between the white and black races that should produce a perfect social and political equality
it was an impossibility
this you have seen in my printed speeches
and with it i have said that in their right to life
and the pursuit of happiness
as proclaimed in that old declaration
the inferior races are our equals
and these declarations i have constantly made in reference to the abstract moral question
to contemplate and consider when we are legislating about any new country which is not already cursed with the actual presence of the evil
i have never manifested any impatience with the necessities that spring from the actual presence of black people amongst us
and the actual existence of slavery amongst us where it does already exist but i have insisted that
in legislating for new countries where it does not exist there is no just rule other than that of moral and abstract right
with reference to those new countries
those maxims as to the right of a people to life
and the pursuit of happiness were the just rules to be constantly referred to
there is no misunderstanding this
except by men interested to misunderstand it
i take it that i have to address an intelligent and reading community
who will peruse what i say
weigh it
and then judge whether i advanced improper or unsound views
or whether i advanced hypocritical
and deceptive
and contrary views in different portions of the country
i believe myself to be guilty of no such thing as the latter
of course
i cannot claim that i am entirely free from all error in the opinions i advance
the judge has also detained us awhile in regard to the distinction between his party and our party
his he assumes to be a national party
ours a sectional one
he does this in asking the question whether this country has any interest in the maintenance of the republican party
he assumes that our party is altogether sectional
that the party to which he adheres is national and the argument is
that no party can be a rightful party and be based upon rightful principles unless it can announce its principles everywhere
i presume that judge douglas could not go into russia and announce the doctrine of our national democracy he could not denounce the doctrine of kings and emperors and monarchies in russia and it may be true of this country that in some places we may not be able to proclaim a doctrine as clearly true as the truth of democracy
because there is a section so directly opposed to it that they will not tolerate us in doing so
is it the true test of the soundness of a doctrine that in some places people won't let you proclaim it
is that the way to test the truth of any doctrine
i understood that at one time the people of chicago would not let judge douglas preach a certain favorite doctrine of his
i commend to his consideration the question whether he takes that as a test of the unsoundness of what he wanted to preach
there is another thing to which i wish to ask attention for a little while on this occasion
what has always been the evidence brought forward to prove that the republican party is a sectional party
the main one was that in the southern portion of the union the people did not let the republicans proclaim their doctrines amongst them
that has been the main evidence brought forward
that they had no supporters
or substantially none
in the slave states
the south have not taken hold of our principles as we announce them nor does judge douglas now grapple with those principles
we have a republican state platform
laid down in springfield in june last stating our position all the way through the questions before the country
we are now far advanced in this canvass
judge douglas and i have made perhaps forty speeches apiece
and we have now for the fifth time met face to face in debate
and up to this day i have not found either judge douglas or any friend of his taking hold of the republican platform
or laying his finger upon anything in it that is wrong
i ask you all to recollect that
judge douglas turns away from the platform of principles to the fact that he can find people somewhere who will not allow us to announce those principles
if he had great confidence that our principles were wrong
he would take hold of them and demonstrate them to be wrong
but he does not do so
the only evidence he has of their being wrong is in the fact that there are people who won't allow us to preach them
i ask again
is that the way to test the soundness of a doctrine
i ask his attention also to the fact that by the rule of nationality he is himself fast becoming sectional
i ask his attention to the fact that his speeches would not go as current now south of the ohio river as they have formerly gone there i ask his attention to the fact that he felicitates himself to day that all the democrats of the free states are agreeing with him
while he omits to tell us that the democrats of any slave state agree with him
if he has not thought of this
i commend to his consideration the evidence in his own declaration
on this day
of his becoming sectional too
i see it rapidly approaching
whatever may be the result of this ephemeral contest between judge douglas and myself
i see the day rapidly approaching when his pill of sectionalism
which he has been thrusting down the throats of republicans for years past
will be crowded down his own throat
in regard to what judge douglas said in the beginning of his speech about the compromise of 1850 containing the principles of the nebraska bill
although i have often presented my views upon that subject
yet as i have not done so in this canvass
i will
if you please
detain you a little with them
i have always maintained
so far as i was able
that there was nothing of the principle of the nebraska bill in the compromise of 1850 at all
nothing whatever
where can you find the principle of the nebraska bill in that compromise
if anywhere
in the two pieces of the compromise organizing the territories of new mexico and utah
it was expressly provided in these two acts that when they came to be admitted into the union they should be admitted with or without slavery
as they should choose
by their own constitutions
nothing was said in either of those acts as to what was to be done in relation to slavery during the territorial existence of those territories
while henry clay constantly made the declaration judge douglas recognizing him as a leader that
in his opinion
the old mexican laws would control that question during the territorial existence
and that these old mexican laws excluded slavery
how can that be used as a principle for declaring that during the territorial existence as well as at the time of framing the constitution the people
if you please
might have slaves if they wanted them
i am not discussing the question whether it is right or wrong but how are the new mexican and utah laws patterns for the nebraska bill
i maintain that the organization of utah and new mexico did not establish a general principle at all
it had no feature of establishing a general principle
the acts to which i have referred were a part of a general system of compromises
they did not lay down what was proposed as a regular policy for the territories
only an agreement in this particular case to do in that way
because other things were done that were to be a compensation for it
they were allowed to come in in that shape
because in another way it was paid for
considering that as a part of that system of measures called the compromise of 1850
which finally included half a dozen acts
it included the admission of california as a free state
which was kept out of the union for half a year because it had formed a free constitution
it included the settlement of the boundary of texas
which had been undefined before
which was in itself a slavery question for if you pushed the line farther west
you made texas larger
and made more slave territory while
if you drew the line toward the east
you narrowed the boundary and diminished the domain of slavery
and by so much increased free territory
it included the abolition of the slave trade in the district of columbia
it included the passage of a new fugitive slave law
all these things were put together
though passed in separate acts
were nevertheless
in legislation as the speeches at the time will show
made to depend upon each other
each got votes with the understanding that the other measures were to pass
and by this system of compromise
in that series of measures
those two bills the new mexico and utah bills were passed
and i say for that reason they could not be taken as models
framed upon their own intrinsic principle
for all future territories
and i have the evidence of this in the fact that judge douglas
a year afterward
or more than a year afterward
when he first introduced bills for the purpose of framing new territories
did not attempt to follow these bills of new mexico and utah and even when he introduced this nebraska bill
i think you will discover that he did not exactly follow them
but i do not wish to dwell at great length upon this branch of the discussion
my own opinion is
that a thorough investigation will show most plainly that the new mexico and utah bills were part of a system of compromise
and not designed as patterns for future territorial legislation and that this nebraska bill did not follow them as a pattern at all
the judge tells
in proceeding
that he is opposed to making any odious distinctions between free and slave states
i am altogether unaware that the republicans are in favor of making any odious distinctions between the free and slave states
but there is still a difference
i think
between judge douglas and the republicans in this
i suppose that the real difference between judge douglas and his friends
and the republicans on the contrary
that the judge is not in favor of making any difference between slavery and liberty that he is in favor of eradicating
of pressing out of view
the questions of preference in this country for free or slave institutions and consequently every sentiment he utters discards the idea that there is any wrong in slavery
everything that emanates from him or his coadjutors in their course of policy carefully excludes the thought that there is anything wrong in slavery
all their arguments
if you will consider them
will be seen to exclude the thought that there is anything whatever wrong in slavery
if you will take the judge's speeches
and select the short and pointed sentences expressed by him
as his declaration that he don't care whether slavery is voted up or down
you will see at once that this is perfectly logical
if you do not admit that slavery is wrong
if you do admit that it is wrong
judge douglas cannot logically say he don't care whether a wrong is voted up or voted down
judge douglas declares that if any community wants slavery they have a right to have it
he can say that logically
if he says that there is no wrong in slavery but if you admit that there is a wrong in it
he cannot logically say that anybody has a right to do wrong
he insists that upon the score of equality the owners of slaves and owners of property of horses and every other sort of property should be alike
and hold them alike in a new territory
that is perfectly logical if the two species of property are alike and are equally founded in right
but if you admit that one of them is wrong
you cannot institute any equality between right and wrong
and from this difference of sentiment
the belief on the part of one that the institution is wrong
and a policy springing from that belief which looks to the arrest of the enlargement of that wrong
and this other sentiment
that it is no wrong
and a policy sprung from that sentiment
which will tolerate no idea of preventing the wrong from growing larger
and looks to there never being an end to it through all the existence of things
arises the real difference between judge douglas and his friends on the one hand and the republicans on the other
i confess myself as belonging to that class in the country who contemplate slavery as a moral
and political evil
having due regard for its actual existence amongst us and the difficulties of getting rid of it in any satisfactory way
and to all the constitutional obligations which have been thrown about it but
desire a policy that looks to the prevention of it as a wrong
and looks hopefully to the time when as a wrong it may come to an end
judge douglas has again
i believe
the fifth time
if not the seventh
in my presence
reiterated his charge of a conspiracy or combination between the national democrats and republicans
what evidence judge douglas has upon this subject i know not
inasmuch as he never favors us with any
i have said upon a former occasion
and i do not choose to suppress it now
that i have no objection to the division in the judge's party
he got it up himself
it was all his and their work
he had
i think
a great deal more to do with the steps that led to the lecompton constitution than mr
buchanan had though at last
when they reached it
they quarreled over it
and their friends divided upon it
i am very free to confess to judge douglas that i have no objection to the division but i defy the judge to show any evidence that i have in any way promoted that division
unless he insists on being a witness himself in merely saying so
i can give all fair friends of judge douglas here to understand exactly the view that republicans take in regard to that division
don't you remember how two years ago the opponents of the democratic party were divided between fremont and fillmore
i guess you do
any democrat who remembers that division will remember also that he was at the time very glad of it
and then he will be able to see all there is between the national democrats and the republicans
what we now think of the two divisions of democrats
you then thought of the fremont and fillmore divisions
that is all there is of it
but if the judge continues to put forward the declaration that there is an unholy and unnatural alliance between the republicans and the national democrats
i now want to enter my protest against receiving him as an entirely competent witness upon that subject
i want to call to the judge's attention an attack he made upon me in the first one of these debates
at ottawa
on the 21st of august
in order to fix extreme abolitionism upon me
judge douglas read a set of resolutions which he declared had been passed by a republican state convention
in october
at springfield
and he declared i had taken part in that convention
it turned out that although a few men calling themselves an anti nebraska state convention had sat at springfield about that time
yet neither did i take any part in it
nor did it pass the resolutions or any such resolutions as judge douglas read
so apparent had it become that the resolutions which he read had not been passed at springfield at all
nor by a state convention in which i had taken part
that seven days afterward
at freeport
judge douglas declared that he had been misled by charles h
editor of the state register
and thomas l
member of congress in that district
and he promised in that speech that when he went to springfield he would investigate the matter
since then judge douglas has been to springfield
and i presume has made the investigation but a month has passed since he has been there
so far as i know
he has made no report of the result of his investigation
i have waited as i think sufficient time for the report of that investigation
and i have some curiosity to see and hear it
a fraud
an absolute forgery was committed
and the perpetration of it was traced to the three
and douglas
whether it can be narrowed in any way so as to exonerate any one of them
is what judge douglas's report would probably show
it is true that the set of resolutions read by judge douglas were published in the illinois state register on the 16th of october
as being the resolutions of an anti nebraska convention which had sat in that same month of october
at springfield
but it is also true that the publication in the register was a forgery then
and the question is still behind
which of the three
if not all of them
committed that forgery
the idea that it was done by mistake is absurd
the article in the illinois state register contains part of the real proceedings of that springfield convention
showing that the writer of the article had the real proceedings before him
and purposely threw out the genuine resolutions passed by the convention and fraudulently substituted the others
lanphier then
as now
was the editor of the register
so that there seems to be but little room for his escape
but then it is to be borne in mind that lanphier had less interest in the object of that forgery than either of the other two
the main object of that forgery at that time was to beat yates and elect harris to congress
and that object was known to be exceedingly dear to judge douglas at that time
harris and douglas were both in springfield when the convention was in session
and although they both left before the fraud appeared in the register
subsequent events show that they have both had their eyes fixed upon that convention
the fraud having been apparently successful upon the occasion
both harris and douglas have more than once since then been attempting to put it to new uses
as the fisherman's wife
whose drowned husband was brought home with his body full of eels
said when she was asked what was to be done with him
take the eels out and set him again
so harris and douglas have shown a disposition to take the eels out of that stale fraud by which they gained harris's election
and set the fraud again more than once
on the 9th of july
douglas attempted a repetition of it upon trumbull on the floor of the senate of the united states
as will appear from the appendix of the congressional globe of that date
on the 9th of august
harris attempted it again upon norton in the house of representatives
as will appear by the same documents
the appendix to the congressional globe of that date
on the 21st of august last
all three lanphier
and harris reattempted it upon me at ottawa
it has been clung to and played out again and again as an exceedingly high trump by this blessed trio
and now that it has been discovered publicly to be a fraud we find that judge douglas manifests no surprise at it at all
he makes no complaint of lanphier
who must have known it to be a fraud from the beginning
and harris are just as cozy now and just as active in the concoction of new schemes as they were before the general discovery of this fraud
all this is very natural if they are all alike guilty in that fraud
and it is very unnatural if any one of them is innocent
lanphier perhaps insists that the rule of honor among thieves does not quite require him to take all upon himself
and consequently my friend judge douglas finds it difficult to make a satisfactory report upon his investigation
but meanwhile the three are agreed that each is a most honorable man
judge douglas requires an indorsement of his truth and honor by a re election to the united states senate
and he makes and reports against me and against judge trumbull
day after day
charges which we know to be utterly untrue
without for a moment seeming to think that this one unexplained fraud
which he promised to investigate
will be the least drawback to his claim to belief
harris ditto
he asks a re election to the lower house of congress without seeming to remember at all that he is involved in this dishonorable fraud
the illinois state register
edited by lanphier
as now
the central organ of both harris and douglas
continues to din the public ear with this assertion
without seeming to suspect that these assertions are at all lacking in title to belief
after all
the question still recurs upon us
how did that fraud originally get into the state register
lanphier then
as now
was the editor of that paper
lanphier knows
lanphier cannot be ignorant of how and by whom it was originally concocted
can he be induced to tell
if he has told
can judge douglas be induced to tell how it originally was concocted
it may be true that lanphier insists that the two men for whose benefit it was originally devised shall at least bear their share of it
how that is
i do not know
and while it remains unexplained i hope to be pardoned if i insist that the mere fact of judge douglas making charges against trumbull and myself is not quite sufficient evidence to establish them
while we were at freeport
in one of these joint discussions
i answered certain interrogatories which judge douglas had propounded to me
and then in turn propounded some to him
which he in a sort of way answered
the third one of these interrogatories i have with me
and wish now to make some comments upon it
it was in these words
if the supreme court of states cannot exclude slavery from their limits
are you in favor of acquiescing in
adhering to
and following such decision as a rule of political action
to this interrogatory judge douglas made no answer in any just sense of the word
he contented himself with sneering at the thought that it was possible for the supreme court ever to make such a decision
he sneered at me for propounding the interrogatory
i had not propounded it without some reflection
and i wish now to address to this audience some remarks upon it
in the second clause of the sixth article
i believe it is
of the constitution of the united states
we find the following language
this constitution and the laws of the united states which shall be made in pursuance thereof
and all treaties made
or which shall be made
under the authority of the united states
shall be the supreme law of the land and the judges in every state shall be bound thereby
anything in the constitution or laws of any state to the contrary notwithstanding
the essence of the dred scott case is compressed into the sentence which i will now read
as we have already said in an earlier part of this opinion
upon a different point
the right of property in a slave is distinctly and expressly affirmed in the constitution
i repeat it
the right of property in a slave is distinctly and expressly affirmed in the constitution
what is it to be affirmed in the constitution
made firm in the constitution
so made that it cannot be separated from the constitution without breaking the constitution durable as the constitution
and part of the constitution
remembering the provision of the constitution which i have read affirming that that instrument is the supreme law of the land that the judges of every state shall be bound by it
any law or constitution of any state to the contrary notwithstanding that the right of property in a slave is affirmed in that constitution
is made
formed into
and cannot be separated from it without breaking it durable as the instrument part of the instrument what follows as a short and even syllogistic argument from it
i think it follows
and i submit to the consideration of men capable of arguing whether
as i state it
in syllogistic form
the argument has any fault in it
nothing in the constitution or laws of any state can destroy a right distinctly and expressly affirmed in the constitution of the united states
the right of property in a slave is distinctly and expressly affirmed in the constitution of the united states
nothing in the constitution or laws of any state can destroy the right of property in a slave
i believe that no fault can be pointed out in that argument assuming the truth of the premises
the conclusion
so far as i have capacity at all to understand it
follows inevitably
there is a fault in it as i think
but the fault is not in the reasoning but the falsehood in fact is a fault of the premises
i believe that the right of property in a slave is not distinctly and expressly affirmed in the constitution
and judge douglas thinks it is
i believe that the supreme court and the advocates of that decision may search in vain for the place in the constitution where the right of property in a slave is distinctly and expressly affirmed i say
that i think one of the premises is not true in fact
but it is true with judge douglas
it is true with the supreme court who pronounced it
they are estopped from denying it
and being estopped from denying it
the conclusion follows that
the constitution of the united states being the supreme law
no constitution or law can interfere with it
it being affirmed in the decision that the right of property in a slave is distinctly and expressly affirmed in the constitution
the conclusion inevitably follows that no state law or constitution can destroy that right
i then say to judge douglas and to all others that i think it will take a better answer than a sneer to show that those who have said that the right of property in a slave is distinctly and expressly affirmed in the constitution
are not prepared to show that no constitution or law can destroy that right
i say i believe it will take a far better argument than a mere sneer to show to the minds of intelligent men that whoever has so said is not prepared
whenever public sentiment is so far advanced as to justify it
to say the other
this is but an opinion
and the opinion of one very humble man but it is my opinion that the dred scott decision
as it is
never would have been made in its present form if the party that made it had not been sustained previously by the elections
my own opinion is
that the new dred scott decision
deciding against the right of the people of the states to exclude slavery
will never be made if that party is not sustained by the elections
i believe
that it is just as sure to be made as to morrow is to come
if that party shall be sustained
i have said
upon a former occasion
and i repeat it now
that the course of arguement that judge douglas makes use of upon this subject i charge not his motives in this
is preparing the public mind for that new dred scott decision
i have asked him again to point out to me the reasons for his first adherence to the dred scott decision as it is
i have turned his attention to the fact that general jackson differed with him in regard to the political obligation of a supreme court decision
i have asked his attention to the fact that jefferson differed with him in regard to the political obligation of a supreme court decision
jefferson said that judges are as honest as other men
and not more so
and he said
that whenever a free people should give up in absolute submission to any department of government
retaining for themselves no appeal from it
their liberties were gone
i have asked his attention to the fact that the cincinnati platform
upon which he says he stands
disregards a time honored decision of the supreme court
in denying the power of congress to establish a national bank
i have asked his attention to the fact that he himself was one of the most active instruments at one time in breaking down the supreme court of the state of illinois because it had made a decision distasteful to him
a struggle ending in the remarkable circumstance of his sitting down as one of the new judges who were to overslaugh that decision getting his title of judge in that very way
so far in this controversy i can get no answer at all from judge douglas upon these subjects
not one can i get from him
except that he swells himself up and says
all of us who stand by the decision of the supreme court are the friends of the constitution all you fellows that dare question it in any way are the enemies of the constitution
now
in this very devoted adherence to this decision
in opposition to all the great political leaders whom he has recognized as leaders
in opposition to his former self and history
there is something very marked
and the manner in which he adheres to it
not as being right upon the merits
as he conceives because he did not discuss that at all
but as being absolutely obligatory upon every one simply because of the source from whence it comes
as that which no man can gainsay
whatever it may be
this is another marked feature of his adherence to that decision
it marks it in this respect
that it commits him to the next decision
whenever it comes
as being as obligatory as this one
since he does not investigate it
and won't inquire whether this opinion is right or wrong
so he takes the next one without inquiring whether it is right or wrong
he teaches men this doctrine
and in so doing prepares the public mind to take the next decision when it comes
without any inquiry
in this i think i argue fairly without questioning motives at all that judge douglas is most ingeniously and powerfully preparing the public mind to take that decision when it comes and not only so
but he is doing it in various other ways
in these general maxims about liberty
in his assertions that he don't care whether slavery is voted up or voted down
that whoever wants slavery has a right to have it that upon principles of equality it should be allowed to go everywhere that there is no inconsistency between free and slave institutions in this he is also preparing whether purposely or not the way for making the institution of slavery national
i repeat again
for i wish no misunderstanding
that i do not charge that he means it so but i call upon your minds to inquire
if you were going to get the best instrument you could
and then set it to work in the most ingenious way
to prepare the public mind for this movement
operating in the free states
where there is now an abhorrence of the institution of slavery
could you find an instrument so capable of doing it as judge douglas
or one employed in so apt a way to do it
i have said once before
and i will repeat it now
that mr
when he was once answering an objection to the colonization society
that it had a tendency to the ultimate emancipation of the slaves
said that
those who would repress all tendencies to liberty and ultimate emancipation must do more than put down the benevolent efforts of the colonization society
they must go back to the era of our liberty and independence
and muzzle the cannon that thunders its annual joyous return they must blow out the moral lights around us they must penetrate the human soul
and eradicate the light of reason and the love of liberty
and i do think i repeat
though i said it on a former occasion that judge douglas and whoever
like him
teaches that the negro has no share
humble though it may be
in the declaration of independence
is going back to the era of our liberty and independence
so far as in him lies
muzzling the cannon that thunders its annual joyous return that he is blowing out the moral lights around us
when he contends that whoever wants slaves has a right to hold them that he is penetrating
so far as lies in his power
the human soul
and eradicating the light of reason and the love of liberty
when he is in every possible way preparing the public mind
by his vast influence
for making the institution of slavery perpetual and national
there is
my friends
only one other point to which i will call your attention for the remaining time that i have left me
and perhaps i shall not occupy the entire time that i have
as that one point may not take me clear through it
among the interrogatories that judge douglas propounded to me at freeport
there was one in about this language
are you opposed to the acquisition of any further territory to the united states
unless slavery shall first be prohibited therein
i answered
as i thought
in this way
that i am not generally opposed to the acquisition of additional territory
and that i would support a proposition for the acquisition of additional territory according as my supporting it was or was not calculated to aggravate this slavery question amongst us
i then proposed to judge douglas another interrogatory
which was correlative to that
are you in favor of acquiring additional territory
in disregard of how it may affect us upon the slavery question
judge douglas answered
that is
in his own way he answered it
i believe that
although he took a good many words to answer it
it was a little more fully answered than any other
the substance of his answer was that this country would continue to expand that it would need additional territory that it was as absurd to suppose that we could continue upon our present territory
enlarging in population as we are
as it would be to hoop a boy twelve years of age
and expect him to grow to man's size without bursting the hoops
i believe it was something like that
he was in favor of the acquisition of further territory as fast as we might need it
in disregard of how it might affect the slavery question
i do not say this as giving his exact language
but he said so substantially and he would leave the question of slavery
where the territory was acquired
to be settled by the people of the acquired territory
that's the doctrine
may be it is let us consider that for a while
this will probably
in the run of things
become one of the concrete manifestations of this slavery question
if judge douglas's policy upon this question succeeds
and gets fairly settled down
until all opposition is crushed out
the next thing will be a grab for the territory of poor mexico
an invasion of the rich lands of south america
then the adjoining islands will follow
each one of which promises additional slave fields
and this question is to be left to the people of those countries for settlement
when we get mexico
i don't know whether the judge will be in favor of the mexican people that we get with it settling that question for themselves and all others because we know the judge has a great horror for mongrels
and i understand that the people of mexico are most decidedly a race of mongrels
i understand that there is not more than one person there out of eight who is pure white
and i suppose from the judge's previous declaration that when we get mexico
or any considerable portion of it
that he will be in favor of these mongrels settling the question
which would bring him somewhat into collision with his horror of an inferior race
it is to be remembered
that this power of acquiring additional territory is a power confided to the president and the senate of the united states
it is a power not under the control of the representatives of the people any further than they
the president and the senate
can be considered the representatives of the people
let me illustrate that by a case we have in our history
when we acquired the territory from mexico in the mexican war
the house of representatives
composed of the immediate representatives of the people
all the time insisted that the territory thus to be acquired should be brought in upon condition that slavery should be forever prohibited therein
upon the terms and in the language that slavery had been prohibited from coming into this country
that was insisted upon constantly and never failed to call forth an assurance that any territory thus acquired should have that prohibition in it
so far as the house of representatives was concerned
but at last the president and senate acquired the territory without asking the house of representatives anything about it
and took it without that prohibition
they have the power of acquiring territory without the immediate representatives of the people being called upon to say anything about it
and thus furnishing a very apt and powerful means of bringing new territory into the union
when it is once brought into the country
involving us anew in this slavery agitation
it is therefore
as i think
a very important question for due consideration of the american people
whether the policy of bringing in additional territory
without considering at all how it will operate upon the safety of the union in reference to this one great disturbing element in our national politics
shall be adopted as the policy of the country
you will bear in mind that it is to be acquired
according to the judge's view
as fast as it is needed
and the indefinite part of this proposition is that we have only judge douglas and his class of men to decide how fast it is needed
we have no clear and certain way of determining or demonstrating how fast territory is needed by the necessities of the country
whoever wants to go out filibustering
thinks that more territory is needed
whoever wants wider slave fields feels sure that some additional territory is needed as slave territory
then it is as easy to show the necessity of additional slave territory as it is to assert anything that is incapable of absolute demonstration
whatever motive a man or a set of men may have for making annexation of property or territory
it is very easy to assert
but much less easy to disprove
that it is necessary for the wants of the country
and now it only remains for me to say that i think it is a very grave question for the people of this union to consider
in view of the fact that this slavery question has been the only one that has ever endangered our republican institutions
the only one that has ever threatened or menaced a dissolution of the union
that has ever disturbed us in such a way as to make us fear for the perpetuity of our liberty
in view of these facts
i think it is an exceedingly interesting and important question for this people to consider whether we shall engage in the policy of acquiring additional territory
discarding altogether from our consideration
while obtaining new territory
the question how it may affect us in regard to this
the only endangering element to our liberties and national greatness
the judge's view has been expressed
in my answer to his question
have expressed mine
i think it will become an important and practical question
our views are before the public
i am willing and anxious that they should consider them fully that they should turn it about and consider the importance of the question
and arrive at a just conclusion as to whether it is or is not wise in the people of this union
in the acquisition of new territory
to consider whether it will add to the disturbance that is existing amongst us whether it will add to the one only danger that has ever threatened the perpetuity of the union or our own liberties
i think it is extremely important that they shall decide
and rightly decide
that question before entering upon that policy
and now
my friends
having said the little i wish to say upon this head
whether i have occupied the whole of the remnant of my time or not
i believe i could not enter upon any new topic so as to treat it fully
without transcending my time
which i would not for a moment think of doing
i give way to judge douglas
sixth joint debate
at quincy
october 13
ladies and gentlemen
i have had no immediate conference with judge douglas
but i will venture to say that he and i will perfectly agree that your entire silence
both when i speak and when he speaks
will be most agreeable to us
in the month of may
the elements in the state of illinois which have since been consolidated into the republican party assembled together in a state convention at bloomington
they adopted at that time what
in political language
is called a platform
in june of the same year the elements of the republican party in the nation assembled together in a national convention at philadelphia
they adopted what is called the national platform
in june
the present year
the republicans of illinois reassembled at springfield
in state convention
and adopted again their platform
as i suppose not differing in any essential particular from either of the former ones
but perhaps adding something in relation to the new developments of political progress in the country
the convention that assembled in june last did me the honor
if it be one
and i esteem it such
to nominate me as their candidate for the united states senate
i have supposed that
in entering upon this canvass
i stood generally upon these platforms
we are now met together on the 13th of october of the same year
only four months from the adoption of the last platform
and i am unaware that in this canvass
from the beginning until to day
any one of our adversaries has taken hold of our platforms
or laid his finger upon anything that he calls wrong in them
in the very first one of these joint discussions between senator douglas and myself
senator douglas
without alluding at all to these platforms
or any one of them
of which i have spoken
attempted to hold me responsible for a set of resolutions passed long before the meeting of either one of these conventions of which i have spoken
and as a ground for holding me responsible for these resolutions
he assumed that they had been passed at a state convention of the republican party
and that i took part in that convention
it was discovered afterward that this was erroneous
that the resolutions which he endeavored to hold me responsible for had not been passed by any state convention anywhere
had not been passed at springfield
where he supposed they had
or assumed that they had
and that they had been passed in no convention in which i had taken part
the judge
was not willing to give up the point that he was endeavoring to make upon me
and he therefore thought to still hold me to the point that he was endeavoring to make
by showing that the resolutions that he read had been passed at a local convention in the northern part of the state
although it was not a local convention that embraced my residence at all
nor one that reached
as i suppose
nearer than one hundred and fifty or two hundred miles of where i was when it met
nor one in which i took any part at all
he also introduced other resolutions
passed at other meetings
and by combining the whole
although they were all antecedent to the two state conventions and the one national convention i have mentioned
still he insisted
and now insists
as i understand
that i am in some way responsible for them
at jonesboro
on our third meeting
i insisted to the judge that i was in no way rightfully held responsible for the proceedings of this local meeting or convention
in which i had taken no part
and in which i was in no way embraced but i insisted to him that if he thought i was responsible for every man or every set of men everywhere
who happen to be my friends
the rule ought to work both ways
and he ought to be responsible for the acts and resolutions of all men or sets of men who were or are now his supporters and friends
and gave him a pretty long string of resolutions
passed by men who are now his friends
and announcing doctrines for which he does not desire to be held responsible
this still does not satisfy judge douglas
he still adheres to his proposition
that i am responsible for what some of my friends in different parts of the state have done
but that he is not responsible for what his have done
at least
so i understand him
but in addition to that
the judge
at our meeting in galesburgh
last week
undertakes to establish that i am guilty of a species of double dealing with the public that i make speeches of a certain sort in the north
among the abolitionists
which i would not make in the south
and that i make speeches of a certain sort in the south which i would not make in the north
i apprehend
in the course i have marked out for myself
that i shall not have to dwell at very great length upon this subject
as this was done in the judge's opening speech at galesburgh
i had an opportunity
as i had the middle speech then
of saying something in answer to it
he brought forward a quotation or two from a speech of mine delivered at chicago
and then
to contrast with it
he brought forward an extract from a speech of mine at charleston
in which he insisted that i was greatly inconsistent
and insisted that his conclusion followed
that i was playing a double part
and speaking in one region one way
and in another region another way
i have not time now to dwell on this as long as i would like
and wish only now to requote that portion of my speech at charleston which the judge quoted
and then make some comments upon it
this he quotes from me as being delivered at charleston
and i believe correctly
i will say
that i am not
nor ever have been
in favor of bringing about in any way the social and political equality of the white and black races that i am not
nor ever have been
in favor of making voters or jurors of negroes
nor of qualifying them to hold office
nor to intermarry with white people and i will say
in addition to this
that there is a physical difference between the white and black races which will forever forbid the two races living together on terms of social and political equality
and inasmuch as they cannot so live while they do remain together
there must be the position of superior and inferior
i am as much as any other man in favor of having the superior position assigned to the white race
this
i believe
is the entire quotation from charleston speech
as judge douglas made it his comments are as follows
here you find men who hurrah for lincoln
and say he is right when he discards all distinction between races
or when he declares that he discards the doctrine that there is such a thing as a superior and inferior race and abolitionists are required and expected to vote for mr
lincoln because he goes for the equality of races
holding that in the declaration of independence the white man and negro were declared equal
and endowed by divine law with equality
and down south
with the old line whigs
with the kentuckians
the virginians and the tennesseeans
he tells you that there is a physical difference between the races
making the one superior
the other inferior
and he is in favor of maintaining the superiority of the white race over the negro
those are the judges comments
i wish to show you that a month
or only lacking three days of a month
before i made the speech at charleston
which the judge quotes from
he had himself heard me say substantially the same thing it was in our first meeting
at ottawa and i will say a word about where it was
and the atmosphere it was in
after a while but at our first meeting
at ottawa
i read an extract from an old speech of mine
made nearly four years ago
not merely to show my sentiments
but to show that my sentiments were long entertained and openly expressed in which extract i expressly declared that my own feelings would not admit a social and political equality between the white and black races
and that even if my own feelings would admit of it
i still knew that the public sentiment of the country would not
and that such a thing was an utter impossibility
or substantially that
that extract from my old speech the reporters by some sort of accident passed over
and it was not reported
i lay no blame upon anybody
i suppose they thought that i would hand it over to them
and dropped reporting while i was giving it
but afterward went away without getting it from me
at the end of that quotation from my old speech
which i read at ottawa
i made the comments which were reported at that time
and which i will now read
and ask you to notice how very nearly they are the same as judge douglas says were delivered by me down in egypt
after reading
i added these words
i don't want to read at any great length but this is the true complexion of all i have ever said in regard to the institution of slavery or the black race
and this is the whole of it
anything that argues me into his idea of perfect social and political equality with the negro
is but a specious and fantastical arrangement of words by which a man can prove a horse chestnut to be a chestnut horse
i will say here
while upon this subject
that i have no purpose
directly or indirectly
to interfere with the institution in the states where it exists
i believe i have no right to do so
i have no inclination to do so
i have no purpose to introduce political and social equality between the white and black races
there is a physical difference between the two which
in my judgment
will probably forever forbid their living together on the footing of perfect equality and inasmuch as it becomes a necessity that there must be a difference
as well as judge douglas
am in favor of the race to which i belong having the superior position
i have never said anything to the contrary
but i hold that
notwithstanding all this
there is no reason in the world why the negro is not entitled to all the rights enumerated in the declaration of independence
the right of life
and the pursuit of happiness
i hold that he is as much entitled to these as the white man
i agree with judge douglas that he is not my equal in many respects
certainly not in color
perhaps not in intellectual and moral endowments but in the right to eat the bread
without the leave of anybody else
which his own hand earns
he is my equal and the equal of judge douglas
and the equal of every other man
i have chiefly introduced this for the purpose of meeting the judge's charge that the quotation he took from my charleston speech was what i would say down south among the kentuckians
the virginians
but would not say in the regions in which was supposed to be more of the abolition element
i now make this comment
that speech from which i have now read the quotation
and which is there given correctly perhaps too much so for good taste was made away up north in the abolition district of this state par excellence
in the lovejoy district
in the personal presence of lovejoy
for he was on the stand with us when i made it
it had been made and put in print in that region only three days less than a month before the speech made at charleston
the like of which judge douglas thinks i would not make where there was any abolition element
i only refer to this matter to say that i am altogether unconscious of having attempted any double dealing anywhere that upon one occasion i may say one thing
and leave other things unsaid
and vice versa
but that i have said anything on one occasion that is inconsistent with what i have said elsewhere
i deny
at least i deny it so far as the intention is concerned
i find that i have devoted to this topic a larger portion of my time than i had intended
i wished to show
but i will pass it upon this occasion
that in the sentiment i have occasionally advanced upon the declaration of independence i am entirely borne out by the sentiments advanced by our old whig leader
henry clay
and i have the book here to show it from but because i have already occupied more time than i intended to do on that topic
i pass over it
at galesburgh
i tried to show that by the dred scott decision
pushed to its legitimate consequences
slavery would be established in all the states as well as in the territories
i did this because
upon a former occasion
i had asked judge douglas whether
if the supreme court should make a decision declaring that the states had not the power to exclude slavery from their limits
he would adopt and follow that decision as a rule of political action and because he had not directly answered that question
but had merely contented himself with sneering at it
i again introduced it
and tried to show that the conclusion that i stated followed inevitably and logically from the proposition already decided by the court
judge douglas had the privilege of replying to me at galesburgh
and again he gave me no direct answer as to whether he would or would not sustain such a decision if made
i give him his third chance to say yes or no
he is not obliged to do either
probably he will not do either but i give him the third chance
i tried to show then that this result
this conclusion
inevitably followed from the point already decided by the court
the judge
in his reply
again sneers at the thought of the court making any such decision
and in the course of his remarks upon this subject uses the language which i will now read
speaking of me
the judge says
he goes on and insists that the dred scott decision would carry slavery into the free states
notwithstanding the decision itself says the contrary
and he adds
lincoln knows that there is no member of the supreme court that holds that doctrine
he knows that every one of them in their opinions held the reverse
i especially introduce this subject again for the purpose of saying that i have the dred scott decision here
and i will thank judge douglas to lay his finger upon the place in the entire opinions of the court where any one of them says the contrary
it is very hard to affirm a negative with entire confidence
i say
that i have examined that decision with a good deal of care
as a lawyer examines a decision and
so far as i have been able to do so
the court has nowhere in its opinions said that the states have the power to exclude slavery
nor have they used other language substantially that
i also say
so far as i can find
not one of the concurring judges has said that the states can exclude slavery
nor said anything that was substantially that
the nearest approach that any one of them has made to it
so far as i can find
was by judge nelson
and the approach he made to it was exactly
in substance
the nebraska bill
that the states had the exclusive power over the question of slavery
so far as they are not limited by the constitution of the united states
i asked the question
if the non concurring judges
mclean or curtis
had asked to get an express declaration that the states could absolutely exclude slavery from their limits
what reason have we to believe that it would not have been voted down by the majority of the judges
just as chase's amendment was voted down by judge douglas and his compeers when it was offered to the nebraska bill
at galesburgh
i said something in regard to those springfield resolutions that judge douglas had attempted to use upon me at ottawa
and commented at some length upon the fact that they were
as presented
not genuine
judge douglas in his reply to me seemed to be somewhat exasperated
he said he would never have believed that abraham lincoln
as he kindly called me
would have attempted such a thing as i had attempted upon that occasion and among other expressions which he used toward me
was that i dared to say forgery
that i had dared to say forgery turning to judge douglas
i did dare to say forgery
but in this political canvass the judge ought to remember that i was not the first who dared to say forgery
at jacksonville
judge douglas made a speech in answer to something said by judge trumbull
and at the close of what he said upon that subject
he dared to say that trumbull had forged his evidence
he said
that he should not concern himself with trumbull any more
but thereafter he should hold lincoln responsible for the slanders upon him
when i met him at charleston after that
although i think that i should not have noticed the subject if he had not said he would hold me responsible for it
i spread out before him the statements of the evidence that judge trumbull had used
and i asked judge douglas
piece by piece
to put his finger upon one piece of all that evidence that he would say was a forgery
when i went through with each and every piece
judge douglas did not dare then to say that any piece of it was a forgery
so it seems that there are some things that judge douglas dares to do
and some that he dares not to do
a voice
it is the same thing with you
yes
it is the same thing with me
i do dare to say forgery when it is true
and don't dare to say forgery when it is false
now i will say here to this audience and to judge douglas i have not dared to say he committed a forgery
and i never shall until i know it but i did dare to say just to suggest to the judge that a forgery had been committed
which by his own showing had been traced to him and two of his friends
i dared to suggest to him that he had expressly promised in one of his public speeches to investigate that matter
and i dared to suggest to him that there was an implied promise that when he investigated it he would make known the result
i dared to suggest to the judge that he could not expect to be quite clear of suspicion of that fraud
for since the time that promise was made he had been with those friends
and had not kept his promise in regard to the investigation and the report upon it
i am not a very daring man
but i dared that much
and i am not much scared about it yet
when the judge says he would n't have believed of abraham lincoln that he would have made such an attempt as that he reminds me of the fact that he entered upon this canvass with the purpose to treat me courteously that touched me somewhat
it sets me to thinking
i was aware
when it was first agreed that judge douglas and i were to have these seven joint discussions
that they were the successive acts of a drama
perhaps i should say
to be enacted
not merely in the face of audiences like this
but in the face of the nation
and to some extent
by my relation to him
and not from anything in myself
in the face of the world and i am anxious that they should be conducted with dignity and in the good temper which would be befitting the vast audiences before which it was conducted
but when judge douglas got home from washington and made his first speech in chicago
the evening afterward i made some sort of a reply to it
his second speech was made at bloomington
in which he commented upon my speech at chicago and said that i had used language ingeniously contrived to conceal my intentions
or words to that effect
i understand that this is an imputation upon my veracity and my candor
i do not know what the judge understood by it
but in our first discussion
at ottawa
he led off by charging a bargain
somewhat corrupt in its character
upon trumbull and myself
that we had entered into a bargain
one of the terms of which was that trumbull was to abolitionize the old democratic party
and i lincoln was to abolitionize the old whig party i pretending to be as good an old line whig as ever
judge douglas may not understand that he implicated my truthfulness and my honor when he said i was doing one thing and pretending another and i misunderstood him if he thought he was treating me in a dignified way
as a man of honor and truth
as he now claims he was disposed to treat me
even after that time
at galesburgh
when he brings forward an extract from a speech made at chicago and an extract from a speech made at charleston
to prove that i was trying to play a double part
that i was trying to cheat the public
and get votes upon one set of principles at one place
and upon another set of principles at another place
i do not understand but what he impeaches my honor
my veracity
and my candor and because he does this
i do not understand that i am bound
if i see a truthful ground for it
to keep my hands off of him
as soon as i learned that judge douglas was disposed to treat me in this way
i signified in one of my speeches that i should be driven to draw upon whatever of humble resources i might have
to adopt a new course with him
i was not entirely sure that i should be able to hold my own with him
but i at least had the purpose made to do as well as i could upon him and now i say that i will not be the first to cry hold
i think it originated with the judge
and when he quits
i probably will
but i shall not ask any favors at all
he asks me
or he asks the audience
if i wish to push this matter to the point of personal difficulty
i tell him
he did not make a mistake
in one of his early speeches
when he called me an amiable man
though perhaps he did when he called me an intelligent man
it really hurts me very much to suppose that i have wronged anybody on earth
i again tell him
i very much prefer
when this canvass shall be over
however it may result
that we at least part without any bitter recollections of personal difficulties
the judge
in his concluding speech at galesburgh
says that i was pushing this matter to a personal difficulty
to avoid the responsibility for the enormity of my principles
i say to the judge and this audience
that i will again state our principles
as well as i hastily can
in all their enormity
and if the judge hereafter chooses to confine himself to a war upon these principles
he will probably not find me departing from the same course
we have in this nation this element of domestic slavery
it is a matter of absolute certainty that it is a disturbing element
it is the opinion of all the great men who have expressed an opinion upon it
that it is a dangerous element
we keep up a controversy in regard to it
that controversy necessarily springs from difference of opinion and if we can learn exactly can reduce to the lowest elements what that difference of opinion is
we perhaps shall be better prepared for discussing the different systems of policy that we would propose in regard to that disturbing element
i suggest that the difference of opinion
reduced to its lowest of terms
is no other than the difference between the men who think slavery a wrong and those who do not think it wrong
the republican party think it wrong we think it is a moral
a social
and a political wrong
we think it as a wrong not confining itself merely to the persons or the states where it exists
but that it is a wrong in its tendency
to say the least
that extends itself to the existence of the whole nation
because we think it wrong
we propose a course of policy that shall deal with it as a wrong
we deal with it as with any other wrong
in so far as we can prevent its growing any larger
and so deal with it that in the run of time there may be some promise of an end to it
we have a due regard to the actual presence of it amongst us
and the difficulties of getting rid of it in any satisfactory way
and all the constitutional obligations thrown about it
i suppose that in reference both to its actual existence in the nation
and to our constitutional obligations
we have no right at all to disturb it in the states where it exists
and we profess that we have no more inclination to disturb it than we have the right to do it
we go further than that
we don't propose to disturb it where
in one instance
we think the constitution would permit us
we think the constitution would permit us to disturb it in the district of columbia
we do not propose to do that
unless it should be in terms which i don't suppose the nation is very likely soon to agree to
the terms of making the emancipation gradual
and compensating the unwilling owners
where we suppose we have the constitutional right
we restrain ourselves in reference to the actual existence of the institution and the difficulties thrown about it
we also oppose it as an evil so far as it seeks to spread itself
we insist on the policy that shall restrict it to its present limits
we don't suppose that in doing this we violate anything due to the actual presence of the institution
or anything due to the constitutional guaranties thrown around it
we oppose the dred scott decision in a certain way
upon which i ought perhaps to address you a few words
we do not propose that when dred scott has been decided to be a slave by the court
as a mob
will decide him to be free
we do not propose that
when any other one
or one thousand
shall be decided by that court to be slaves
we will in any violent way disturb the rights of property thus settled but we nevertheless do oppose that decision as a political rule which shall be binding on the voter to vote for nobody who thinks it wrong
which shall be binding on the members of congress or the president to favor no measure that does not actually concur with the principles of that decision
we do not propose to be bound by it as a political rule in that way
because we think it lays the foundation
not merely of enlarging and spreading out what we consider an evil
but it lays the foundation for spreading that evil into the states themselves
we propose so resisting it as to have it reversed if we can
and a new judicial rule established upon this subject
i will add this
that if there be any man who does not believe that slavery is wrong in the three aspects which i have mentioned
or in any one of them
that man is misplaced
and ought to leave us while on the other hand
if there be any man in the republican party who is impatient over the necessity springing from its actual presence
and is impatient of the constitutional guaranties thrown around it
and would act in disregard of these
he too is misplaced
standing with us
he will find his place somewhere else for we have a due regard
so far as we are capable of understanding them
for all these things
as well as i can give it
is a plain statement of our principles in all their enormity
i will say now that there is a sentiment in the country contrary to me
a sentiment which holds that slavery is not wrong
and therefore it goes for the policy that does not propose dealing with it as a wrong
that policy is the democratic policy
and that sentiment is the democratic sentiment
if there be a doubt in the mind of any one of this vast audience that this is really the central idea of the democratic party in relation to this subject
i ask him to bear with me while i state a few things tending
as i think
to prove that proposition
in the first place
the leading man i think i may do my friend judge douglas the honor of calling him such advocating the present democratic policy never himself says it is wrong
he has the high distinction
so far as i know
of never having said slavery is either right or wrong
almost everybody else says one or the other
but the judge never does
if there be a man in the democratic party who thinks it is wrong
and yet clings to that party
i suggest to him
in the first place
that his leader don't talk as he does
for he never says that it is wrong
in the second place
i suggest to him that if he will examine the policy proposed to be carried forward
he will find that he carefully excludes the idea that there is anything wrong in it
if you will examine the arguments that are made on it
you will find that every one carefully excludes the idea that there is anything wrong in slavery
perhaps that democrat who says he is as much opposed to slavery as i am will tell me that i am wrong about this
i wish him to examine his own course in regard to this matter a moment
and then see if his opinion will not be changed a little
you say it is wrong but don't you constantly object to anybody else saying so
do you not constantly argue that this is not the right place to oppose it
you say it must not be opposed in the free states
because slavery is not here it must not be opposed in the slave states
because it is there it must not be opposed in politics
because that will make a fuss it must not be opposed in the pulpit
because it is not religion
then where is the place to oppose it
there is no suitable place to oppose it
there is no place in the country to oppose this evil overspreading the continent
which you say yourself is coming
frank blair and gratz brown tried to get up a system of gradual emancipation in missouri
had an election in august
and got beat
and you
threw up your hat
and hallooed hurrah for democracy
so i say
that in regard to the arguments that are made
when judge douglas says he don't care whether slavery is voted up or voted down
whether he means that as an individual expression of sentiment
or only as a sort of statement of his views on national policy
it is alike true to say that he can thus argue logically if he don't see anything wrong in it but he cannot say so logically if he admits that slavery is wrong
he cannot say that he would as soon see a wrong voted up as voted down
when judge douglas says that whoever or whatever community wants slaves
they have a right to have them
he is perfectly logical
if there is nothing wrong in the institution but if you admit that it is wrong
he cannot logically say that anybody has a right to do wrong
when he says that slave property and horse and hog property are alike to be allowed to go into the territories
upon the principles of equality
he is reasoning truly
if there is no difference between them as property but if the one is property held rightfully
and the other is wrong
then there is no equality between the right and wrong so that
turn it in anyway you can
in all the arguments sustaining the democratic policy
and in that policy itself
there is a careful
studied exclusion of the idea that there is anything wrong in slavery
let us understand this
i am not
just here
trying to prove that we are right
and they are wrong
i have been stating where we and they stand
and trying to show what is the real difference between us and i now say that whenever we can get the question distinctly stated
can get all these men who believe that slavery is in some of these respects wrong to stand and act with us in treating it as a wrong
and not till then
i think we will in some way come to an end of this slavery agitation
lincoln's rejoinder
my friends
since judge douglas has said to you in his conclusion that he had not time in an hour and a half to answer all i had said in an hour
it follows of course that i will not be able to answer in half an hour all that he said in an hour and a half
i wish to return to judge douglas my profound thanks for his public annunciation here to day
to be put on record
that his system of policy in regard to the institution of slavery contemplates that it shall last forever
we are getting a little nearer the true issue of this controversy
and i am profoundly grateful for this one sentence
judge douglas asks you
why cannot the institution of slavery
or rather
why cannot the nation
part slave and part free
continue as our fathers made it
in the first place
i insist that our fathers did not make this nation half slave and half free
or part slave and part free
i insist that they found the institution of slavery existing here
they did not make it so but they left it so because they knew of no way to get rid of it at that time
when judge douglas undertakes to say that
as a matter of choice
the fathers of the government made this nation part slave and part free
he assumes what is historically a falsehood
more than that
when the fathers of the government cut off the source of slavery by the abolition of the slave trade
and adopted a system of restricting it from the new territories where it had not existed
i maintain that they placed it where they understood
and all sensible men understood
it was in the course of ultimate extinction and when judge douglas asks me why it cannot continue as our fathers made it
i ask him why he and his friends could not let it remain as our fathers made it
it is precisely all i ask of him in relation to the institution of slavery
that it shall be placed upon the basis that our fathers placed it upon
of south carolina
once said
and truly said
that when this government was established
no one expected the institution of slavery to last until this day
and that the men who formed this government were wiser and better than the men of these days but the men of these days had experience which the fathers had not
and that experience had taught them the invention of the cotton gin
and this had made the perpetuation of the institution of slavery a necessity in this country
judge douglas could not let it stand upon the basis which our fathers placed it
but removed it
and put it upon the cotton gin basis
it is a question
for him and his friends to answer
why they could not let it remain where the fathers of the government originally placed it
i hope nobody has understood me as trying to sustain the doctrine that we have a right to quarrel with kentucky
or virginia
or any of the slave states
about the institution of slavery
thus giving the judge an opportunity to be eloquent and valiant against us in fighting for their rights
i expressly declared in my opening speech that i had neither the inclination to exercise
nor the belief in the existence of
the right to interfere with the states of kentucky or virginia in doing as they pleased with slavery or any other existing institution
then what becomes of all his eloquence in behalf of the rights of states
which are assailed by no living man
but i have to hurry on
for i have but a half hour
the judge has informed me
or informed this audience
that the washington union is laboring for my election to the united states senate
this is news to me
not very ungrateful news either
turning to mr
who was on the stand i hope that carlin will be elected to the state senate
and will vote for me
carlin shook his head
carlin don't fall in
i perceive
and i suppose he will not do much for me but i am glad of all the support i can get
if i can get it without practicing any deception to obtain it
in respect to this large portion of judge douglas's speech in which he tries to show that in the controversy between himself and the administration party he is in the right
i do not feel myself at all competent or inclined to answer him
i say to him
give it to them
give it to them just all you can
and
on the other hand
i say to carlin
and jake davis
and to this man wogley up here in hancock
give it to douglas
just pour it into him
now
in regard to this matter of the dred scott decision
i wish to say a word or two
after all
the judge will not say whether
if a decision is made holding that the people of the states cannot exclude slavery
he will support it or not
he obstinately refuses to say what he will do in that case
the judges of the supreme court as obstinately refused to say what they would do on this subject
before this i reminded him that at galesburgh he said the judges had expressly declared the contrary
and you remember that in my opening speech i told him i had the book containing that decision here
and i would thank him to lay his finger on the place where any such thing was said
he has occupied his hour and a half
and he has not ventured to try to sustain his assertion
he never will
but he is desirous of knowing how we are going to reverse that dred scott decision
judge douglas ought to know how
did not he and his political friends find a way to reverse the decision of that same court in favor of the constitutionality of the national bank
didn't they find a way to do it so effectually that they have reversed it as completely as any decision ever was reversed
so far as its practical operation is concerned
and let me ask you
did n't judge douglas find a way to reverse the decision of our supreme court when it decided that carlin's father old governor carlin had not the constitutional power to remove a secretary of state
did he not appeal to the mobs
as he calls them
did he not make speeches in the lobby to show how villainous that decision was
and how it ought to be overthrown
did he not succeed
in getting an act passed by the legislature to have it overthrown
and did n't he himself sit down on that bench as one of the five added judges
who were to overslaugh the four old ones
getting his name of judge in that way
and no other
if there is a villainy in using disrespect or making opposition to supreme court decisions
i commend it to judge douglas's earnest consideration
i know of no man in the state of illinois who ought to know so well about how much villainy it takes to oppose a decision of the supreme court as our honorable friend stephen a
judge douglas also makes the declaration that i say the democrats are bound by the dred scott decision
while the republicans are not
in the sense in which he argues
i never said it but i will tell you what i have said and what i do not hesitate to repeat to day
i have said that as the democrats believe that decision to be correct
and that the extension of slavery is affirmed in the national constitution
they are bound to support it as such and i will tell you here that general jackson once said each man was bound to support the constitution as he understood it
now
judge douglas understands the constitution according to the dred scott decision
and he is bound to support it as he understands it
i understand it another way
and therefore i am bound to support it in the way in which i understand it
and as judge douglas believes that decision to be correct
i will remake that argument if i have time to do so
let me talk to some gentleman down there among you who looks me in the face
we will say you are a member of the territorial legislature
like judge douglas
you believe that the right to take and hold slaves there is a constitutional right the first thing you do is to swear you will support the constitution
and all rights guaranteed therein that you will
whenever your neighbor needs your legislation to support his constitutional rights
not withhold that legislation
if you withhold that necessary legislation for the support of the constitution and constitutional rights
do you not commit perjury
i ask every sensible man if that is not so
that is undoubtedly just so
say what you please
that is precisely what judge douglas says
that this is a constitutional right
does the judge mean to say that the territorial legislature in legislating may
by withholding necessary laws
or by passing unfriendly laws
nullify that constitutional right
does he mean to say that
does he mean to ignore the proposition so long and well established in law
that what you cannot do directly
you cannot do indirectly
does he mean that
the truth about the matter is this
judge douglas has sung paeans to his popular sovereignty doctrine until his supreme court
co operating with him
has squatted his squatter sovereignty out
but he will keep up this species of humbuggery about squatter sovereignty
he has at last invented this sort of do nothing sovereignty
that the people may exclude slavery by a sort of sovereignty that is exercised by doing nothing at all
is not that running his popular sovereignty down awfully
has it not got down as thin as the homeopathic soup that was made by boiling the shadow of a pigeon that had starved to death
but at last
when it is brought to the test of close reasoning
there is not even that thin decoction of it left
it is a presumption impossible in the domain of thought
it is precisely no other than the putting of that most unphilosophical proposition
that two bodies can occupy the same space at the same time
the dred scott decision covers the whole ground
and while it occupies it
there is no room even for the shadow of a starved pigeon to occupy the same ground
judge douglas
in reply to what i have said about having upon a previous occasion made the speech at ottawa as the one he took an extract from at charleston
says it only shows that i practiced the deception twice
my friends
are any of you obtuse enough to swallow that
judge douglas had said i had made a speech at charleston that i would not make up north
and i turned around and answered him by showing i had made that same speech up north
had made it at ottawa made it in his hearing made it in the abolition district
in lovejoy's district
in the personal presence of lovejoy himself
in the same atmosphere exactly in which i had made my chicago speech
of which he complains so much
in relation to my not having said anything about the quotation from the chicago speech
he thinks that is a terrible subject for me to handle
i can show you that the substance of the chicago speech i delivered two years ago in egypt
as he calls it
it was down at springfield
that speech is here in this book
and i could turn to it and read it to you but for the lack of time
i have not now the time to read it
read it
read it
no
i am obliged to use discretion in disposing most advantageously of my brief time
the judge has taken great exception to my adopting the heretical statement in the declaration of independence
that all men are created equal
and he has a great deal to say about negro equality
i want to say that in sometimes alluding to the declaration of independence
i have only uttered the sentiments that henry clay used to hold
allow me to occupy your time a moment with what he said
clay was at one time called upon in indiana
and in a way that i suppose was very insulting
to liberate his slaves and he made a written reply to that application
and one portion of it is in these words
what is the foundation of this appeal to me in indiana to liberate the slaves under my care in kentucky
it is a general declaration in the act announcing to the world the independence of the thirteen american colonies
that men are created equal
as an abstract principle
there is no doubt of the truth of that declaration
and it is desirable in the original construction of society
and in organized societies
to keep it in view as a great fundamental principle
when i sometimes
in relation to the organization of new societies in new countries
where the soil is clean and clear
insisted that we should keep that principle in view
judge douglas will have it that i want a negro wife
he never can be brought to understand that there is any middle ground on this subject
i have lived until my fiftieth year
and have never had a negro woman either for a slave or a wife
and i think i can live fifty centuries
for that matter
without having had one for either
i maintain that you may take judge douglas's quotations from my chicago speech
and from my charleston speech
and the galesburgh speech
in his speech of to day
and compare them over
and i am willing to trust them with you upon his proposition that they show rascality or double dealing
i deny that they do
the judge does not seem at all disposed to have peace
but i find he is disposed to have a personal warfare with me
he says that my oath would not be taken against the bare word of charles h
lanphier or thomas l
that is altogether a matter of opinion
it is certainly not for me to vaunt my word against oaths of these gentlemen
but i will tell judge douglas again the facts upon which i dared to say they proved a forgery
i pointed out at galesburgh that the publication of these resolutions in the illinois state register could not have been the result of accident
as the proceedings of that meeting bore unmistakable evidence of being done by a man who knew it was a forgery that it was a publication partly taken from the real proceedings of the convention
and partly from the proceedings of a convention at another place
which showed that he had the real proceedings before him
and taking one part of the resolutions
he threw out another part
and substituted false and fraudulent ones in their stead
i pointed that out to him
and also that his friend lanphier
who was editor of the register at that time and now is
must have known how it was done
whether he did it
or got some friend to do it for him
i could not tell
but he certainly knew all about it
i pointed out to judge douglas that in his freeport speech he had promised to investigate that matter
does he now say that he did not make that promise
i have a right to ask why he did not keep it
i call upon him to tell here to day why he did not keep that promise
that fraud has been traced up so that it lies between him
and lanphier
there is little room for escape for lanphier
lanphier is doing the judge good service
and douglas desires his word to be taken for the truth
he desires lanphier to be taken as authority in what he states in his newspaper
he desires harris to be taken as a man of vast credibility and when this thing lies among them
they will not press it to show where the guilt really belongs
as he has said that he would investigate it
and implied that he would tell us the result of his investigation
i demand of him to tell why he did not investigate it
if he did not and if he did
why he won't tell the result
i call upon him for that
this is the third time that judge douglas has assumed that he learned about these resolutions by harris's attempting to use them against norton on the floor of congress
i tell judge douglas the public records of the country show that he himself attempted it upon trumbull a month before harris tried them on norton that harris had the opportunity of learning it from him
rather than he from harris
i now ask his attention to that part of the record on the case
my friends
i am not disposed to detain you longer in regard to that matter
i am told that i still have five minutes left
there is another matter i wish to call attention to
he says
when he discovered there was a mistake in that case
he came forward magnanimously
without my calling his attention to it
and explained it
i will tell you how he became so magnanimous
when the newspapers of our side had discovered and published it
and put it beyond his power to deny it
then he came forward and made a virtue of necessity by acknowledging it
now he argues that all the point there was in those resolutions
although never passed at springfield
is retained by their being passed at other localities
is that true
he said i had a hand in passing them
in his opening speech
that i was in the convention and helped to pass them
do the resolutions touch me at all
it strikes me there is some difference between holding a man responsible for an act which he has not done and holding him responsible for an act that he has done
you will judge whether there is any difference in the spots
and he has taken credit for great magnanimity in coming forward and acknowledging what is proved on him beyond even the capacity of judge douglas to deny and he has more capacity in that way than any other living man
then he wants to know why i won't withdraw the charge in regard to a conspiracy to make slavery national
as he has withdrawn the one he made
may it please his worship
i will withdraw it when it is proven false on me as that was proven false on him
i will add a little more than that
i will withdraw it whenever a reasonable man shall be brought to believe that the charge is not true
i have asked judge douglas's attention to certain matters of fact tending to prove the charge of a conspiracy to nationalize slavery
and he says he convinces me that this is all untrue because buchanan was not in the country at that time
and because the dred scott case had not then got into the supreme court and he says that i say the democratic owners of dred scott got up the case
i never did say that i defy judge douglas to show that i ever said so
for i never uttered it
one of mr
douglas's reporters gesticulated affirmatively at mr
i don't care if your hireling does say i did
i tell you myself that i never said the democratic owners of dred scott got up the case
i have never pretended to know whether dred scott's owners were democrats
or abolitionists
or freesoilers or border ruffians
i have said that there is evidence about the case tending to show that it was a made up case
for the purpose of getting that decision
i have said that that evidence was very strong in the fact that when dred scott was declared to be a slave
the owner of him made him free
showing that he had had the case tried and the question settled for such use as could be made of that decision he cared nothing about the property thus declared to be his by that decision
but my time is out
and i can say no more
last debate
at alton
october 15
1858 mr
lincoln's reply ladies and gentlemen
i have been somewhat
in my own mind
complimented by a large portion of judge douglas's speech
i mean that portion which he devotes to the controversy between himself and the present administration
this is the seventh time judge douglas and myself have met in these joint discussions
and he has been gradually improving in regard to his war with the administration
at quincy
day before yesterday
he was a little more severe upon the administration than i had heard him upon any occasion
and i took pains to compliment him for it
i then told him to give it to them with all the power he had and as some of them were present
i told them i would be very much obliged if they would give it to him in about the same way
i take it he has now vastly improved upon the attack he made then upon the administration
i flatter myself he has really taken my advice on this subject
all i can say now is to re commend to him and to them what i then commended
to prosecute the war against one another in the most vigorous manner
i say to them again
go it
go it
there is one other thing i will mention before i leave this branch of the discussion
although i do not consider it much of my business
i refer to that part of the judge's remarks where he undertakes to involve mr
buchanan in an inconsistency
he reads something from mr
from which he undertakes to involve him in an inconsistency and he gets something of a cheer for having done so
i would only remind the judge that while he is very valiantly fighting for the nebraska bill and the repeal of the missouri compromise
it has been but a little while since he was the valiant advocate of the missouri compromise
i want to know if buchanan has not as much right to be inconsistent as douglas has
has douglas the exclusive right
in this country
of being on all sides of all questions
is nobody allowed that high privilege but himself
is he to have an entire monopoly on that subject
so far as judge douglas addressed his speech to me
or so far as it was about me
it is my business to pay some attention to it
i have heard the judge state two or three times what he has stated to day
that in a speech which i made at springfield
i had in a very especial manner complained that the supreme court in the dred scott case had decided that a negro could never be a citizen of the united states
i have omitted by some accident heretofore to analyze this statement
and it is required of me to notice it now
in point of fact it is untrue
i never have complained especially of the dred scott decision because it held that a negro could not be a citizen
and the judge is always wrong when he says i ever did so complain of it
i have the speech here
and i will thank him or any of his friends to show where i said that a negro should be a citizen
and complained especially of the dred scott decision because it declared he could not be one
i have done no such thing and judge douglas
so persistently insisting that i have done so
has strongly impressed me with the belief of a predetermination on his part to misrepresent me
he could not get his foundation for insisting that i was in favor of this negro equality anywhere else as well as he could by assuming that untrue proposition
let me tell this audience what is true in regard to that matter and the means by which they may correct me if i do not tell them truly is by a recurrence to the speech itself
i spoke of the dred scott decision in my springfield speech
and i was then endeavoring to prove that the dred scott decision was a portion of a system or scheme to make slavery national in this country
i pointed out what things had been decided by the court
i mentioned as a fact that they had decided that a negro could not be a citizen that they had done so
as i supposed
to deprive the negro
under all circumstances
of the remotest possibility of ever becoming a citizen and claiming the rights of a citizen of the united states under a certain clause of the constitution
i stated that
without making any complaint of it at all
i then went on and stated the other points decided in the case namely
that the bringing of a negro into the state of illinois and holding him in slavery for two years here was a matter in regard to which they would not decide whether it would make him free or not that they decided the further point that taking him into a united states territory where slavery was prohibited by act of congress did not make him free
because that act of congress
as they held
was unconstitutional
i mentioned these three things as making up the points decided in that case
i mentioned them in a lump
taken in connection with the introduction of the nebraska bill
and the amendment of chase
offered at the time
declaratory of the right of the people of the territories to exclude slavery
which was voted down by the friends of the bill
i mentioned all these things together
as evidence tending to prove a combination and conspiracy to make the institution of slavery national
in that connection and in that way i mentioned the decision on the point that a negro could not be a citizen
and in no other connection
out of this judge douglas builds up his beautiful fabrication of my purpose to introduce a perfect social and political equality between the white and black races
his assertion that i made an especial objection that is his exact language to the decision on this account is untrue in point of fact
while i am upon this subject
and as henry clay has been alluded to
i desire to place myself
in connection with mr
as nearly right before this people as may be
i am quite aware what the judge's object is here by all these allusions
he knows that we are before an audience having strong sympathies southward
by relationship
place of birth
and so on
he desires to place me in an extremely abolition attitude
he read upon a former occasion
and alludes
without reading
to day to a portion of a speech which i delivered in chicago
in his quotations from that speech
as he has made them upon former occasions
the extracts were taken in such a way as
i suppose
brings them within the definition of what is called garbling
taking portions of a speech which
when taken by themselves
do not present the entire sense of the speaker as expressed at the time
i propose
out of that same speech
to show how one portion of it which he skipped over taking an extract before and an extract after will give a different idea
and the true idea i intended to convey
it will take me some little time to read it
but i believe i will occupy the time that way
you have heard him frequently allude to my controversy with him in regard to the declaration of independence
i confess that i have had a struggle with judge douglas on that matter
and i will try briefly to place myself right in regard to it on this occasion
i said and it is between the extracts judge douglas has taken from this speech
and put in his published speeches
it may be argued that there are certain conditions that make necessities and impose them upon us
and to the extent that a necessity is imposed upon a man he must submit to it
i think that was the condition in which we found ourselves when we established this government
we had slaves among us
we could not get our constitution unless we permitted them to remain in slavery
we could not secure the good we did secure if we grasped for more and having by necessity submitted to that much
it does not destroy the principle that is the charter of our liberties
let the charter remain as our standard
now
i have upon all occasions declared as strongly as judge douglas against the disposition to interfere with the existing institution of slavery
you hear me read it from the same speech from which he takes garbled extracts for the purpose of proving upon me a disposition to interfere with the institution of slavery
and establish a perfect social and political equality between negroes and white people
allow me while upon this subject briefly to present one other extract from a speech of mine
more than a year ago
at springfield
in discussing this very same question
soon after judge douglas took his ground that negroes were
not included in the declaration of independence
i think the authors of that notable instrument intended to include all men
but they did not mean to declare all men equal in all respects
they did not mean to say all men were equal in color
moral development
or social capacity
they defined with tolerable distinctness in what they did consider all men created equal
equal in certain inalienable rights
among which are life
and the pursuit of happiness
this they said
and this they meant
they did not mean to assert the obvious untruth that all were then actually enjoying that equality
or yet that they were about to confer it immediately upon them
in fact they had no power to confer such a boon
they meant simply to declare the right
so that the enforcement of it might follow as fast as circumstances should permit
they meant to set up a standard maxim for free society which should be familiar to all
constantly looked to
constantly labored for
and even
though never perfectly attained
constantly approximated
and thereby constantly spreading and deepening its influence
and augmenting the happiness and value of life to all people
of all colors
there again are the sentiments i have expressed in regard to the declaration of independence upon a former occasion
sentiments which have been put in print and read wherever anybody cared to know what so humble an individual as myself chose to say in regard to it
at galesburgh
the other day
i said
in answer to judge douglas
that three years ago there never had been a man
so far as i knew or believed
in the whole world
who had said that the declaration of independence did not include negroes in the term all men
i reassert it to day
i assert that judge douglas and all his friends may search the whole records of the country
and it will be a matter of great astonishment to me if they shall be able to find that one human being three years ago had ever uttered the astounding sentiment that the term all men in the declaration did not include the negro
do not let me be misunderstood
i know that more than three years ago there were men who
finding this assertion constantly in the way of their schemes to bring about the ascendency and perpetuation of slavery
denied the truth of it
i know that mr
calhoun and all the politicians of his school denied the truth of the declaration
i know that it ran along in the mouth of some southern men for a period of years
ending at last in that shameful
though rather forcible
declaration of pettit of indiana
upon the floor of the united states senate
that the declaration of independence was in that respect a self evident lie
rather than a self evident truth
but i say
with a perfect knowledge of all this hawking at the declaration without directly attacking it
that three years ago there never had lived a man who had ventured to assail it in the sneaking way of pretending to believe it
and then asserting it did not include the negro
i believe the first man who ever said it was chief justice taney in the dred scott case
and the next to him was our friend stephen a
and now it has become the catchword of the entire party
i would like to call upon his friends everywhere to consider how they have come in so short a time to view this matter in a way so entirely different from their former belief to ask whether they are not being borne along by an irresistible current
they know not
in answer to my proposition at galesburgh last week
i see that some man in chicago has got up a letter
addressed to the chicago times
to show
as he professes
that somebody had said so before and he signs himself an old line whig
if i remember correctly
in the first place
i would say he was not an old line whig
i am somewhat acquainted with old line whigs from the origin to the end of that party i became pretty well acquainted with them
and i know they always had some sense
whatever else you could ascribe to them
i know there never was one who had not more sense than to try to show by the evidence he produces that some men had
prior to the time i named
said that negroes were not included in the term all men in the declaration of independence
what is the evidence he produces
i will bring forward his evidence
and let you see what he offers by way of showing that somebody more than three years ago had said negroes were not included in the declaration
he brings forward part of a speech from henry clay
the part of the speech of henry clay which i used to bring forward to prove precisely the contrary
i guess we are surrounded to some extent to day by the old friends of mr
and they will be glad to hear anything from that authority
while he was in indiana a man presented a petition to liberate his negroes
and he mr
clay made a speech in answer to it
which i suppose he carefully wrote out himself and caused to be published
i have before me an extract from that speech which constitutes the evidence this pretended old line whig at chicago brought forward to show that mr
clay did n't suppose the negro was included in the declaration of independence
hear what mr
clay said
and what is the foundation of this appeal to me in indiana to liberate the slaves under my care in kentucky
it is a general declaration in the act announcing to the world the independence of the thirteen american colonies
that all men are created equal
as an abstract principle
there is no doubt of the truth of that declaration and it is desirable
in the original construction of society and in organized societies
to keep it in view as a great fundamental principle
i apprehend that in no society that ever did exist
or ever shall be formed
was or can the equality asserted among the members of the human race be practically enforced and carried out
there are portions
large portions
transient sojourners
that will always probably remain subject to the government of another portion of the community
that declaration
whatever may be the extent of its import
was made by the delegations of the thirteen states
in most of them slavery existed
and had long existed
and was established by law
it was introduced and forced upon the colonies by the paramount law of england
do you believe that in making that declaration the states that concurred in it intended that it should be tortured into a virtual emancipation of all the slaves within their respective limits
would virginia and other southern states have ever united in a declaration which was to be interpreted into an abolition of slavery among them
did any one of the thirteen colonies entertain such a design or expectation
to impute such a secret and unavowed purpose
would be to charge a political fraud upon the noblest band of patriots that ever assembled in council
a fraud upon the confederacy of the revolution a fraud upon the union of those states whose constitution not only recognized the lawfulness of slavery
but permitted the importation of slaves from africa until the year 1808
this is the entire quotation brought forward to prove that somebody previous to three years ago had said the negro was not included in the term all men in the declaration
how does it do so
in what way has it a tendency to prove that
clay says it is true as an abstract principle that all men are created equal
but that we cannot practically apply it in all eases
he illustrates this by bringing forward the cases of females
and insane persons
with whom it cannot be enforced but he says it is true as an abstract principle in the organization of society as well as in organized society and it should be kept in view as a fundamental principle
let me read a few words more before i add some comments of my own
clay says
a little further on
i desire no concealment of my opinions in regard to the institution of slavery
i look upon it as a great evil
and deeply lament that we have derived it from the parental government and from our ancestors
i wish every slave in the united states was in the country of his ancestors
but here they are
and the question is
how can they be best dealt with
if a state of nature existed
and we were about to lay the foundations of society
no man would be more strongly opposed than i should be to incorporate the institution of slavery amongst its elements
now
here in this same book
in this same speech
in this same extract
brought forward to prove that mr
clay held that the negro was not included in the declaration of independence
is no such statement on his part
but the declaration that it is a great fundamental truth which should be constantly kept in view in the organization of society and in societies already organized
but if i say a word about it if i attempt
as mr
clay said all good men ought to do
to keep it in view if
in this organized society
i ask to have the public eye turned upon it if i ask
in relation to the organization of new territories
that the public eye should be turned upon it
forthwith i am vilified as you hear me to day
what have i done that i have not the license of henry clay's illustrious example here in doing
have i done aught that i have not his authority for
while maintaining that in organizing new territories and societies this fundamental principle should be regarded
and in organized society holding it up to the public view and recognizing what he recognized as the great principle of free government
and when this new principle this new proposition that no human being ever thought of three years ago is brought forward
i combat it as having an evil tendency
if not an evil design
i combat it as having a tendency to dehumanize the negro
to take away from him the right of ever striving to be a man
i combat it as being one of the thousand things constantly done in these days to prepare the public mind to make property
and nothing but property
of the negro in all the states of this union
but there is a point that i wish
before leaving this part of the discussion
to ask attention to
i have read and i repeat the words of henry clay
i desire no concealment of my opinions in regard to the institution of slavery
i look upon it as a great evil
and deeply lament that we have derived it from the parental government and from our ancestors
i wish every slave in the united states was in the country of his ancestors
but here they are
and the question is
how can they be best dealt with
if a state of nature existed
and we were about to lay the foundations of society
no man would be more strongly opposed than i should be to incorporate the institution of slavery amongst its elements
the principle upon which i have insisted in this canvass is in relation to laying the foundations of new societies
i have never sought to apply these principles to the old states for the purpose of abolishing slavery in those states
it is nothing but a miserable perversion of what i have said
to assume that i have declared missouri
or any other slave state
shall emancipate her slaves i have proposed no such thing
but when mr
clay says that in laying the foundations of society in our territories where it does not exist
he would be opposed to the introduction of slavery as an element
i insist that we have his warrant his license for insisting upon the exclusion of that element which he declared in such strong and emphatic language was most hurtful to him
judge douglas has again referred to a springfield speech in which i said a house divided against itself cannot stand
the judge has so often made the entire quotation from that speech that i can make it from memory
i used this language
we are now far into the fifth year since a policy was initiated with the avowed object and confident promise of putting an end to the slavery agitation
under the operation of this policy
that agitation has not only not ceased
but has constantly augmented
in my opinion it will not cease until a crisis shall have been reached and passed
a house divided against itself cannot stand
 i believe this government cannot endure permanently
half slave and half free
i do not expect the house to fall
but i do expect it will cease to be divided
it will become all one thing
or all the other
either the opponents of slavery will arrest the further spread of it
and place it where the public mind shall rest in the belief that it is in the course of ultimate extinction
or its advocates will push it forward till it shall become alike lawful in all the states
old as well as new
north as well as south
that extract and the sentiments expressed in it have been extremely offensive to judge douglas
he has warred upon them as satan wars upon the bible
his perversions upon it are endless
here now are my views upon it in brief
i said we were now far into the fifth year since a policy was initiated with the avowed object and confident promise of putting an end to the slavery agitation
is it not so
when that nebraska bill was brought forward four years ago last january
was it not for the avowed object of putting an end to the slavery agitation
we were to have no more agitation in congress it was all to be banished to the territories
by the way
i will remark here that
as judge douglas is very fond of complimenting mr
crittenden in these days
crittenden has said there was a falsehood in that whole business
for there was no slavery agitation at that time to allay
we were for a little while quiet on the troublesome thing
and that very allaying plaster of judge douglas's stirred it up again
but was it not understood or intimated with the confident promise of putting an end to the slavery agitation
surely it was
in every speech you heard judge douglas make
until he got into this imbroglio
as they call it
with the administration about the lecompton constitution
every speech on that nebraska bill was full of his felicitations that we were just at the end of the slavery agitation
the last tip of the last joint of the old serpent's tail was just drawing out of view
but has it proved so
i have asserted that under that policy that agitation has not only not ceased
but has constantly augmented
when was there ever a greater agitation in congress than last winter
when was it as great in the country as to day
there was a collateral object in the introduction of that nebraska policy
which was to clothe the people of the territories with a superior degree of self government
beyond what they had ever had before
the first object and the main one of conferring upon the people a higher degree of self government is a question of fact to be determined by you in answer to a single question
have you ever heard or known of a people anywhere on earth who had as little to do as
in the first instance of its use
the people of kansas had with this same right of self government
in its main policy and in its collateral object
it has been nothing but a living
creeping lie from the time of its introduction till to day
i have intimated that i thought the agitation would not cease until a crisis should have been reached and passed
i have stated in what way i thought it would be reached and passed
i have said that it might go one way or the other
we might
by arresting the further spread of it
and placing it where the fathers originally placed it
put it where the public mind should rest in the belief that it was in the course of ultimate extinction
thus the agitation may cease
it may be pushed forward until it shall become alike lawful in all the states
old as well as new
north as well as south
i have said
and i repeat
my wish is that the further spread of it may be arrested
and that it may be where the public mind shall rest in the belief that it is in the course of ultimate extinction i have expressed that as my wish i entertain the opinion
upon evidence sufficient to my mind
that the fathers of this government placed that institution where the public mind did rest in the belief that it was in the course of ultimate extinction
let me ask why they made provision that the source of slavery the african slave trade should be cut off at the end of twenty years
why did they make provision that in all the new territory we owned at that time slavery should be forever inhibited
why stop its spread in one direction
and cut off its source in another
if they did not look to its being placed in the course of its ultimate extinction
the institution of slavery is only mentioned in the constitution of the united states two or three times
and in neither of these cases does the word slavery or negro race occur but covert language is used each time
and for a purpose full of significance
what is the language in regard to the prohibition of the african slave trade
it runs in about this way
the migration or importation of such persons as any of the states now existing shall think proper to admit
shall not be prohibited by the congress prior to the year one thousand eight hundred and eight
the next allusion in the constitution to the question of slavery and the black race is on the subject of the basis of representation
and there the language used is
representatives and direct taxes shall be apportioned among the several states which may be included within this union
according to their respective numbers
which shall be determined by adding to the whole number of free persons
including those bound to service for a term of years
and excluding indians not taxed
three fifths of all other persons
it says persons
not slaves
not negroes but this three fifths can be applied to no other class among us than the negroes
in the provision for the reclamation of fugitive slaves
it is said
no person held to service or labor in one state
under the laws thereof
escaping into another
shall in consequence of any law or regulation therein be discharged from such service or labor
but shall be delivered up
on claim of the party to whom such service or labor may be due
there again there is no mention of the word negro or of slavery
in all three of these places
being the only allusions to slavery in the instrument
covert language is used
language is used not suggesting that slavery existed or that the black race were among us
and i understand the contemporaneous history of those times to be that covert language was used with a purpose
and that purpose was that in our constitution
which it was hoped and is still hoped will endure forever
when it should be read by intelligent and patriotic men
after the institution of slavery had passed from among us
there should be nothing on the face of the great charter of liberty suggesting that such a thing as negro slavery had ever existed among us
this is part of the evidence that the fathers of the government expected and intended the institution of slavery to come to an end
they expected and intended that it should be in the course of ultimate extinction
and when i say that i desire to see the further spread of it arrested
i only say i desire to see that done which the fathers have first done
when i say i desire to see it placed where the public mind will rest in the belief that it is in the course of ultimate extinction
i only say i desire to see it placed where they placed it
it is not true that our fathers
as judge douglas assumes
made this government part slave and part free
understand the sense in which he puts it
he assumes that slavery is a rightful thing within itself
was introduced by the framers of the constitution
the exact truth is
that they found the institution existing among us
and they left it as they found it
but in making the government they left this institution with many clear marks of disapprobation upon it
they found slavery among them
and they left it among them because of the difficulty the absolute impossibility of its immediate removal
and when judge douglas asks me why we cannot let it remain part slave and part free
as the fathers of the government made it
he asks a question based upon an assumption which is itself a falsehood and i turn upon him and ask him the question
when the policy that the fathers of the government had adopted in relation to this element among us was the best policy in the world
the only wise policy
the only policy that we can ever safely continue upon that will ever give us peace
unless this dangerous element masters us all and becomes a national institution
i turn upon him and ask him why he could not leave it alone
i turn and ask him why he was driven to the necessity of introducing a new policy in regard to it
he has himself said he introduced a new policy
he said so in his speech on the 22d of march of the present year
i ask him why he could not let it remain where our fathers placed it
i ask
of judge douglas and his friends why we shall not again place this institution upon the basis on which the fathers left it
i ask you
when he infers that i am in favor of setting the free and slave states at war
when the institution was placed in that attitude by those who made the constitution
did they make any war
if we had no war out of it when thus placed
wherein is the ground of belief that we shall have war out of it if we return to that policy
have we had any peace upon this matter springing from any other basis
i maintain that we have not
i have proposed nothing more than a return to the policy of the fathers
i confess
when i propose a certain measure of policy
it is not enough for me that i do not intend anything evil in the result
but it is incumbent on me to show that it has not a tendency to that result
i have met judge douglas in that point of view
i have not only made the declaration that i do not mean to produce a conflict between the states
but i have tried to show by fair reasoning
and i think i have shown to the minds of fair men
that i propose nothing but what has a most peaceful tendency
the quotation that i happened to make in that springfield speech
that a house divided against itself cannot stand
and which has proved so offensive to the judge
was part and parcel of the same thing
he tries to show that variety in the democratic institutions of the different states is necessary and indispensable
i do not dispute it
i have no controversy with judge douglas about that
i shall very readily agree with him that it would be foolish for us to insist upon having a cranberry law here in illinois
where we have no cranberries
because they have a cranberry law in indiana
where they have cranberries
i should insist that it would be exceedingly wrong in us to deny to virginia the right to enact oyster laws
where they have oysters
because we want no such laws here
i understand
i hope
quite as well as judge douglas or anybody else
that the variety in the soil and climate and face of the country
and consequent variety in the industrial pursuits and productions of a country
require systems of law conforming to this variety in the natural features of the country
i understand quite as well as judge douglas that if we here raise a barrel of flour more than we want
and the louisianians raise a barrel of sugar more than they want
it is of mutual advantage to exchange
that produces commerce
brings us together
and makes us better friends
we like one another the more for it
and i understand as well as judge douglas
or anybody else
that these mutual accommodations are the cements which bind together the different parts of this union that instead of being a thing to divide the house
figuratively expressing the union
they tend to sustain it they are the props of the house
tending always to hold it up
but when i have admitted all this
i ask if there is any parallel between these things and this institution of slavery
i do not see that there is any parallel at all between them
consider it
when have we had any difficulty or quarrel amongst ourselves about the cranberry laws of indiana
or the oyster laws of virginia
or the pine lumber laws of maine
or the fact that louisiana produces sugar
and illinois flour
when have we had any quarrels over these things
when have we had perfect peace in regard to this thing which i say is an element of discord in this union
we have sometimes had peace
but when was it
it was when the institution of slavery remained quiet where it was
we have had difficulty and turmoil whenever it has made a struggle to spread itself where it was not
i ask
if experience does not speak in thunder tones telling us that the policy which has given peace to the country heretofore
being returned to
gives the greatest promise of peace again
you may say
and judge douglas has intimated the same thing
that all this difficulty in regard to the institution of slavery is the mere agitation of office seekers and ambitious northern politicians
he thinks we want to get his place
i suppose
i agree that there are office seekers amongst us
the bible says somewhere that we are desperately selfish
i think we would have discovered that fact without the bible
i do not claim that i am any less so than the average of men
but i do claim that i am not more selfish than judge douglas
but is it true that all the difficulty and agitation we have in regard to this institution of slavery spring from office seeking
from the mere ambition of politicians
is that the truth
how many times have we had danger from this question
go back to the day of the missouri compromise
go back to the nullification question
at the bottom of which lay this same slavery question
go back to the time of the annexation of texas
go back to the troubles that led to the compromise of 1850
you will find that every time
with the single exception of the nullification question
they sprung from an endeavor to spread this institution
there never was a party in the history of this country
and there probably never will be
of sufficient strength to disturb the general peace of the country
parties themselves may be divided and quarrel on minor questions
yet it extends not beyond the parties themselves
but does not this question make a disturbance outside of political circles
does it not enter into the churches and rend them asunder
what divided the great methodist church into two parts
north and south
what has raised this constant disturbance in every presbyterian general assembly that meets
what disturbed the unitarian church in this very city two years ago
what has jarred and shaken the great american tract society recently
not yet splitting it
but sure to divide it in the end
is it not this same mighty
deep seated power that somehow operates on the minds of men
exciting and stirring them up in every avenue of society
in politics
in religion
in literature
in morals
in all the manifold relations of life
is this the work of politicians
is that irresistible power
which for fifty years has shaken the government and agitated the people
to be stifled and subdued by pretending that it is an exceedingly simple thing
and we ought not to talk about it
if you will get everybody else to stop talking about it
i assure you i will quit before they have half done so
but where is the philosophy or statesmanship which assumes that you can quiet that disturbing element in our society which has disturbed us for more than half a century
which has been the only serious danger that has threatened our institutions
i say
where is the philosophy or the statesmanship based on the assumption that we are to quit talking about it
and that the public mind is all at once to cease being agitated by it
yet this is the policy here in the north that douglas is advocating
that we are to care nothing about it
i ask you if it is not a false philosophy
is it not a false statesmanship that undertakes to build up a system of policy upon the basis of caring nothing about the very thing that everybody does care the most about a thing which all experience has shown we care a very great deal about
the judge alludes very often in the course of his remarks to the exclusive right which the states have to decide the whole thing for themselves
i agree with him very readily that the different states have that right
he is but fighting a man of straw when he assumes that i am contending against the right of the states to do as they please about it
our controversy with him is in regard to the new territories
we agree that when the states come in as states they have the right and the power to do as they please
we have no power as citizens of the free states
or in our federal capacity as members of the federal union through the general government
to disturb slavery in the states where it exists
we profess constantly that we have no more inclination than belief in the power of the government to disturb it yet we are driven constantly to defend ourselves from the assumption that we are warring upon the rights of the sates
what i insist upon is
that the new territories shall be kept free from it while in the territorial condition
judge douglas assumes that we have no interest in them
that we have no right whatever to interfere
i think we have some interest
i think that as white men we have
do we not wish for an outlet for our surplus population
if i may so express myself
do we not feel an interest in getting to that outlet with such institutions as we would like to have prevail there
if you go to the territory opposed to slavery
and another man comes upon the same ground with his slave
upon the assumption that the things are equal
it turns out that he has the equal right all his way
and you have no part of it your way
if he goes in and makes it a slave territory
and by consequence a slave state
is it not time that those who desire to have it a free state were on equal ground
let me suggest it in a different way
how many democrats are there about here a thousand who have left slave states and come into the free state of illinois to get rid of the institution of slavery
another voice
a thousand and one
i reckon there are a thousand and one
i will ask you
if the policy you are now advocating had prevailed when this country was in a territorial condition
where would you have gone to get rid of it
where would you have found your free state or territory to go to
and when hereafter
for any cause
the people in this place shall desire to find new homes
if they wish to be rid of the institution
where will they find the place to go to
irrespective of the moral aspect of this question as to whether there is a right or wrong in enslaving a negro
i am still in favor of our new territories being in such a condition that white men may find a home
may find some spot where they can better their condition where they can settle upon new soil and better their condition in life
i am in favor of this
not merely i must say it here as i have elsewhere for our own people who are born amongst us
but as an outlet for free white people everywhere the world over in which hans
and baptiste
and patrick
and all other men from all the world
may find new homes and better their conditions in life
i have stated upon former occasions
and i may as well state again
what i understand to be the real issue in this controversy between judge douglas and myself
on the point of my wanting to make war between the free and the slave states
there has been no issue between us
when he assumes that i am in favor of producing a perfect social and political equality between the white and black races
these are false issues
upon which judge douglas has tried to force the controversy
there is no foundation in truth for the charge that i maintain either of these propositions
the real issue in this controversy the one pressing upon every mind is the sentiment on the part of one class that looks upon the institution of slavery as a wrong
and of another class that does not look upon it as a wrong
the sentiment that contemplates the institution of slavery in this country as a wrong is the sentiment of the republican party
it is the sentiment around which all their actions
all their arguments
from which all their propositions radiate
they look upon it as being a moral
and political wrong and while they contemplate it as such
they nevertheless have due regard for its actual existence among us
and the difficulties of getting rid of it in any satisfactory way
and to all the constitutional obligations thrown about it
having a due regard for these
they desire a policy in regard to it that looks to its not creating any more danger
they insist that it should
as far as may be
be treated as a wrong and one of the methods of treating it as a wrong is to make provision that it shall grow no larger
they also desire a policy that looks to a peaceful end of slavery at some time
these are the views they entertain in regard to it as i understand them and all their sentiments
all their arguments and propositions
are brought within this range
i have said
and i repeat it here
that if there be a man amongst us who does not think that the institution of slavery is wrong in any one of the aspects of which i have spoken
he is misplaced
and ought not to be with us
and if there be a man amongst us who is so impatient of it as a wrong as to disregard its actual presence among us and the difficulty of getting rid of it suddenly in a satisfactory way
and to disregard the constitutional obligations thrown about it
that man is misplaced if he is on our platform
we disclaim sympathy with him in practical action
he is not placed properly with us
on this subject of treating it as a wrong
and limiting its spread
let me say a word
has anything ever threatened the existence of this union save and except this very institution of slavery
what is it that we hold most dear amongst us
our own liberty and prosperity
what has ever threatened our liberty and prosperity
save and except this institution of slavery
if this is true
how do you propose to improve the condition of things by enlarging slavery
by spreading it out and making it bigger
you may have a wen or cancer upon your person
and not be able to cut it out
lest you bleed to death but surely it is no way to cure it
to engraft it and spread it over your whole body
that is no proper way of treating what you regard a wrong
you see this peaceful way of dealing with it as a wrong
restricting the spread of it
and not allowing it to go into new countries where it has not already existed
that is the peaceful way
the old fashioned way
the way in which the fathers themselves set us the example
on the other hand
i have said there is a sentiment which treats it as not being wrong
that is the democratic sentiment of this day
i do not mean to say that every man who stands within that range positively asserts that it is right
that class will include all who positively assert that it is right
and all who
like judge douglas
treat it as indifferent and do not say it is either right or wrong
these two classes of men fall within the general class of those who do not look upon it as a wrong
and if there be among you anybody who supposes that he
as a democrat
can consider himself as much opposed to slavery as anybody
i would like to reason with him
you never treat it as a wrong
what other thing that you consider as a wrong do you deal with as you deal with that
perhaps you say it is wrong but your leader never does
and you quarrel with anybody who says it is wrong
although you pretend to say so yourself
you can find no fit place to deal with it as a wrong
you must not say anything about it in the free states
because it is not here
you must not say anything about it in the slave states
because it is there
you must not say anything about it in the pulpit
because that is religion
and has nothing to do with it
you must not say anything about it in politics
because that will disturb the security of my place
there is no place to talk about it as being a wrong
although you say yourself it is a wrong
you will screw yourself up to the belief that if the people of the slave states should adopt a system of gradual emancipation on the slavery question
you would be in favor of it
you would be in favor of it
you say that is getting it in the right place
and you would be glad to see it succeed
but you are deceiving yourself
you all know that frank blair and gratz brown
down there in st
undertook to introduce that system in missouri
they fought as valiantly as they could for the system of gradual emancipation which you pretend you would be glad to see succeed
i will bring you to the test
after a hard fight they were beaten
and when the news came over here
you threw up your hats and hurrahed for democracy
more than that
take all the argument made in favor of the system you have proposed
and it carefully excludes the idea that there is anything wrong in the institution of slavery
the arguments to sustain that policy carefully exclude it
even here to day you heard judge douglas quarrel with me because i uttered a wish that it might sometime come to an end
although henry clay could say he wished every slave in the united states was in the country of his ancestors
i am denounced by those pretending to respect henry clay for uttering a wish that it might sometime
in some peaceful way
come to an end
the democratic policy in regard to that institution will not tolerate the merest breath
the slightest hint
of the least degree of wrong about it
try it by some of judge douglas's arguments
he says he don't care whether it is voted up or voted down in the territories
i do not care myself
in dealing with that expression
whether it is intended to be expressive of his individual sentiments on the subject
or only of the national policy he desires to have established
it is alike valuable for my purpose
any man can say that who does not see anything wrong in slavery but no man can logically say it who does see a wrong in it
because no man can logically say he don't care whether a wrong is voted up or voted down
he may say he don't care whether an indifferent thing is voted up or down
but he must logically have a choice between a right thing and a wrong thing
he contends that whatever community wants slaves has a right to have them
so they have
if it is not a wrong
but if it is a wrong
he cannot say people have a right to do wrong
he says that upon the score of equality slaves should be allowed to go in a new territory
like other property
this is strictly logical if there is no difference between it and other property
if it and other property are equal
this argument is entirely logical
but if you insist that one is wrong and the other right
there is no use to institute a comparison between right and wrong
you may turn over everything in the democratic policy from beginning to end
whether in the shape it takes on the statute book
in the shape it takes in the dred scott decision
in the shape it takes in conversation
or the shape it takes in short maxim like arguments
it everywhere carefully excludes the idea that there is anything wrong in it
that is the real issue
that is the issue that will continue in this country when these poor tongues of judge douglas and myself shall be silent
it is the eternal struggle between these two principles right and wrong throughout the world
they are the two principles that have stood face to face from the beginning of time
and will ever continue to struggle
the one is the common right of humanity
and the other the divine right of kings
it is the same principle in whatever shape it develops itself
it is the same spirit that says
you work and toil and earn bread
and i'll eat it
no matter in what shape it comes
whether from the mouth of a king who seeks to bestride the people of his own nation and live by the fruit of their labor
or from one race of men as an apology for enslaving another race
it is the same tyrannical principle
i was glad to express my gratitude at quincy
and i re express it here
to judge douglas
that he looks to no end of the institution of slavery
that will help the people to see where the struggle really is
it will hereafter place with us all men who really do wish the wrong may have an end
and whenever we can get rid of the fog which obscures the real question
when we can get judge douglas and his friends to avow a policy looking to its perpetuation
we can get out from among that class of men and bring them to the side of those who treat it as a wrong
then there will soon be an end of it
and that end will be its ultimate extinction
whenever the issue can be distinctly made
and all extraneous matter thrown out so that men can fairly see the real difference between the parties
this controversy will soon be settled
and it will be done peaceably too
there will be no war
no violence
it will be placed again where the wisest and best men of the world placed it
brooks of south carolina once declared that when this constitution was framed its framers did not look to the institution existing until this day
when he said this
i think he stated a fact that is fully borne out by the history of the times
but he also said they were better and wiser men than the men of these days
yet the men of these days had experience which they had not
and by the invention of the cotton gin it became a necessity in this country that slavery should be perpetual
i now say that
willingly or unwillingly purposely or without purpose
judge douglas has been the most prominent instrument in changing the position of the institution of slavery
which the fathers of the government expected to come to an end ere this
and putting it upon brooks's cotton gin basis placing it where he openly confesses he has no desire there shall ever be an end of it
i understand i have ten minutes yet
i will employ it in saying something about this argument judge douglas uses
while he sustains the dred scott decision
that the people of the territories can still somehow exclude slavery
the first thing i ask attention to is the fact that judge douglas constantly said
before the decision
that whether they could or not
was a question for the supreme court
but after the court had made the decision he virtually says it is not a question for the supreme court
but for the people
and how is it he tells us they can exclude it
he says it needs police regulations
and that admits of unfriendly legislation
although it is a right established by the constitution of the united states to take a slave into a territory of the united states and hold him as property
yet unless the territorial legislature will give friendly legislation
and more especially if they adopt unfriendly legislation
they can practically exclude him
without meeting this proposition as a matter of fact
i pass to consider the real constitutional obligation
let me take the gentleman who looks me in the face before me
and let us suppose that he is a member of the territorial legislature
the first thing he will do will be to swear that he will support the constitution of the united states
his neighbor by his side in the territory has slaves and needs territorial legislation to enable him to enjoy that constitutional right
can he withhold the legislation which his neighbor needs for the enjoyment of a right which is fixed in his favor in the constitution of the united states which he has sworn to support
can he withhold it without violating his oath
more especially
can he pass unfriendly legislation to violate his oath
this is a monstrous sort of talk about the constitution of the united states
there has never been as outlandish or lawless a doctrine from the mouth of any respectable man on earth
i do not believe it is a constitutional right to hold slaves in a territory of the united states
i believe the decision was improperly made and i go for reversing it
judge douglas is furious against those who go for reversing a decision
but he is for legislating it out of all force while the law itself stands
i repeat that there has never been so monstrous a doctrine uttered from the mouth of a respectable man
i suppose most of us i know it of myself believe that the people of the southern states are entitled to a congressional fugitive slave law
that is a right fixed in the constitution
but it cannot be made available to them without congressional legislation
in the judge's language
it is a barren right
which needs legislation before it can become efficient and valuable to the persons to whom it is guaranteed
and as the right is constitutional
i agree that the legislation shall be granted to it
and that not that we like the institution of slavery
we profess to have no taste for running and catching niggers
at least
i profess no taste for that job at all
why then do i yield support to a fugitive slave law
because i do not understand that the constitution
which guarantees that right
can be supported without it
and if i believed that the right to hold a slave in a territory was equally fixed in the constitution with the right to reclaim fugitives
i should be bound to give it the legislation necessary to support it
i say that no man can deny his obligation to give the necessary legislation to support slavery in a territory
who believes it is a constitutional right to have it there
no man can
who does not give the abolitionists an argument to deny the obligation enjoined by the constitution to enact a fugitive state law
try it now
it is the strongest abolition argument ever made
i say if that dred scott decision is correct
then the right to hold slaves in a territory is equally a constitutional right with the right of a slaveholder to have his runaway returned
no one can show the distinction between them
the one is express
so that we cannot deny it
the other is construed to be in the constitution
so that he who believes the decision to be correct believes in the right
and the man who argues that by unfriendly legislation
in spite of that constitutional right
slavery may be driven from the territories
cannot avoid furnishing an argument by which abolitionists may deny the obligation to return fugitives
and claim the power to pass laws unfriendly to the right of the slaveholder to reclaim his fugitive
i do not know how such an arguement may strike a popular assembly like this
but i defy anybody to go before a body of men whose minds are educated to estimating evidence and reasoning
and show that there is an iota of difference between the constitutional right to reclaim a fugitive and the constitutional right to hold a slave
in a territory
provided this dred scott decision is correct
i defy any man to make an argument that will justify unfriendly legislation to deprive a slaveholder of his right to hold his slave in a territory
that will not equally
in all its length
and thickness
furnish an argument for nullifying the fugitive slave law
there is not such an abolitionist in the nation as douglas
after all
such an abolitionist in the nation as douglas
after all
the papers and writings of abraham lincoln volume one constitutional edition by abraham lincoln edited by arthur brooks lapsley with an introduction by theodore roosevelt the essay on lincoln by carl schurz the address on lincoln by joseph choate volume 1
introductory immediately after lincoln's re election to the presidency
in an off hand speech
delivered in response to a serenade by some of his admirers on the evening of november 10
he spoke as follows
it has long been a grave question whether any government not too strong for the liberties of its people can be strong enough to maintain its existence in great emergencies
on this point
the present rebellion brought our republic to a severe test
and the presidential election
occurring in regular course during the rebellion
added not a little to the strain
the strife of the election is but human nature practically applied to the facts in the case
what has occurred in this case must ever occur in similar cases
human nature will not change
in any future great national trial
compared with the men of this
we shall have as weak and as strong
as silly and as wise
as bad and as good
let us therefore study the incidents in this as philosophy to learn wisdom from and none of them as wrongs to be avenged
now that the election is over
may not all having a common interest reunite in a common fort to save our common country
for my own part
i have striven and shall strive to avoid placing any obstacle in the way
so long as i have been here
i have not willingly planted a thorn in any man's bosom
while i am deeply sensible to the high compliment of a re election and duly grateful
as i trust
to almighty god for having directed my countrymen to a right conclusion
as i think for their own good
it adds nothing to my satisfaction that any other man may be disappointed or pained by the result
this speech has not attracted much general attention
yet it is in a peculiar degree both illustrative and typical of the great statesman who made it
alike in its strong common sense and in its lofty standard of morality
lincoln's life
lincoln's deeds and words
are not only of consuming interest to the historian
but should be intimately known to every man engaged in the hard practical work of american political life
it is difficult to overstate how much it means to a nation to have as the two foremost figures in its history men like washington and lincoln
it is good for every man in any way concerned in public life to feel that the highest ambition any american can possibly have will be gratified just in proportion as he raises himself toward the standards set by these two men
it is a very poor thing
whether for nations or individuals
to advance the history of great deeds done in the past as an excuse for doing poorly in the present but it is an excellent thing to study the history of the great deeds of the past
and of the great men who did them
with an earnest desire to profit thereby so as to render better service in the present
in their essentials
the men of the present day are much like the men of the past
and the live issues of the present can be faced to better advantage by men who have in good faith studied how the leaders of the nation faced the dead issues of the past
such a study of lincoln's life will enable us to avoid the twin gulfs of immorality and inefficiency the gulfs which always lie one on each side of the careers alike of man and of nation
it helps nothing to have avoided one if shipwreck is encountered in the other
the fanatic
the well meaning moralist of unbalanced mind
the parlor critic who condemns others but has no power himself to do good and but little power to do ill all these were as alien to lincoln as the vicious and unpatriotic themselves
his life teaches our people that they must act with wisdom
because otherwise adherence to right will be mere sound and fury without substance and that they must also act high mindedly
or else what seems to be wisdom will in the end turn out to be the most destructive kind of folly
throughout his entire life
and especially after he rose to leadership in his party
lincoln was stirred to his depths by the sense of fealty to a lofty ideal but throughout his entire life
he also accepted human nature as it is
and worked with keen
practical good sense to achieve results with the instruments at hand
it is impossible to conceive of a man farther removed from baseness
farther removed from corruption
from mere self seeking but it is also impossible to conceive of a man of more sane and healthy mind a man less under the influence of that fantastic and diseased morality so fantastic and diseased as to be in reality profoundly immoral which makes a man in this work a day world refuse to do what is possible because he cannot accomplish the impossible
in the fifth volume of lecky's history of england
the historian draws an interesting distinction between the qualities needed for a successful political career in modern society and those which lead to eminence in the spheres of pure intellect or pure moral effort
he says
the moral qualities that are required in the higher spheres of statesmanship are not those of a hero or a saint
passionate earnestness and self devotion
complete concentration of every faculty on an unselfish aim
uncalculating daring
a delicacy of conscience and a loftiness of aim far exceeding those of the average of men
are here likely to prove rather a hindrance than an assistance
the politician deals very largely with the superficial and the commonplace his art is in a great measure that of skilful compromise
and in the conditions of modern life
the statesman is likely to succeed best who possesses secondary qualities to an unusual degree
who is in the closest intellectual and moral sympathy with the average of the intelligent men of his time
and who pursues common ideals with more than common ability
business talent
knowledge of men
promptitude and sagacity in dealing with immediate emergencies
a character which lends itself easily to conciliation
diminishes friction and inspires confidence
are especially needed
and they are more likely to be found among shrewd and enlightened men of the world than among men of great original genius or of an heroic type of character
the american people should feel profoundly grateful that the greatest american statesman since washington
the statesman who in this absolutely democratic republic succeeded best
was the very man who actually combined the two sets of qualities which the historian thus puts in antithesis
abraham lincoln
the rail splitter
the western country lawyer
was one of the shrewdest and most enlightened men of the world
and he had all the practical qualities which enable such a man to guide his countrymen and yet he was also a genius of the heroic type
a leader who rose level to the greatest crisis through which this nation or any other nation had to pass in the nineteenth century

introductory note i have endured
wrote lincoln not long before his death
a great deal of ridicule without much malice
and have received a great deal of kindness not quite free from ridicule
on easter day
the world knew how little this ridicule
how much this kindness
had really signified
lincoln the man became lincoln the hero
year by year more heroic
until to day
with the swift passing of those who knew him
his figure grows ever dimmer
less real
this should not be
for lincoln the man
set in a high resolve
is worth far more than lincoln the hero
vaguely glorious
invaluable is the example of the man
intangible that of the hero
though it is not for us
as for those who in awed stillness listened at gettysburg with inspired perception
to know abraham lincoln
yet there is for us another way whereby we may attain such knowledge through his words uttered in all sincerity to those who loved or hated him
unsatisfying they may seem
these printed words
while we can yet speak with those who knew him
and look into eyes that once looked into his
but in truth it is here that we find his simple greatness
his great simplicity
and though no man tried less so to show his power
no man has so shown it more clearly
thus these writings of abraham lincoln are associated with those of washington
and of the other founders of the republic
not that lincoln should become still more of the past
that he with them should become still more of the present
however faint and mythical may grow the story of that great struggle
the leader
at least should remain a real
living american
no matter how clearly
how directly
lincoln has shown himself in his writings
we yet should not forget those men whose minds
from their various view points
have illumined for us his character
as this nation owes a great debt to lincoln
lincoln's memory owes a great debt to a nation which
as no other nation could have done
has been able to appreciate his full worth
among the many who have brought about this appreciation

material much of which is widely scattered in public libraries and in private collections
he has been fortunate in securing certain interesting correspondence and papers which had not before come into print in book form

abraham lincoln
an essay by carl shurz no american can study the character and career of abraham lincoln without being carried away by sentimental emotions
we are always inclined to idealize that which we love
a state of mind very unfavorable to the exercise of sober critical judgment
it is therefore not surprising that most of those who have written or spoken on that extraordinary man
even while conscientiously endeavoring to draw a lifelike portraiture of his being
and to form a just estimate of his public conduct
should have drifted into more or less indiscriminating eulogy
painting his great features in the most glowing colors
and covering with tender shadings whatever might look like a blemish
but his standing before posterity will not be exalted by mere praise of his virtues and abilities
nor by any concealment of his limitations and faults
the stature of the great man
one of whose peculiar charms consisted in his being so unlike all other great men
will rather lose than gain by the idealization which so easily runs into the commonplace
for it was distinctly the weird mixture of qualities and forces in him
of the lofty with the common
the ideal with the uncouth
of that which he had become with that which he had not ceased to be
that made him so fascinating a character among his fellow men
gave him his singular power over their minds and hearts
and fitted him to be the greatest leader in the greatest crisis of our national life
his was indeed a marvellous growth
the statesman or the military hero born and reared in a log cabin is a familiar figure in american history but we may search in vain among our celebrities for one whose origin and early life equalled abraham lincoln's in wretchedness
he first saw the light in a miserable hovel in kentucky
on a farm consisting of a few barren acres in a dreary neighborhood his father a typical poor southern white
shiftless and without ambition for himself or his children
constantly looking for a new piece of land on which he might make a living without much work his mother
in her youth handsome and bright
grown prematurely coarse in feature and soured in mind by daily toil and care the whole household squalid
and utterly void of elevating inspirations
only when the family had moved into the malarious backwoods of indiana
the mother had died
and a stepmother
a woman of thrift and energy
had taken charge of the children
the shaggy headed
forlorn boy
then seven years old
began to feel like a human being
hard work was his early lot
when a mere boy he had to help in supporting the family
either on his father's clearing
or hired out to other farmers to plough
or dig ditches
or chop wood
or drive ox teams occasionally also to tend the baby
when the farmer's wife was otherwise engaged
he could regard it as an advancement to a higher sphere of activity when he obtained work in a crossroads store
where he amused the customers by his talk over the counter for he soon distinguished himself among the backwoods folk as one who had something to say worth listening to
to win that distinction
he had to draw mainly upon his wits for
while his thirst for knowledge was great
his opportunities for satisfying that thirst were wofully slender
in the log schoolhouse
which he could visit but little
he was taught only reading
and elementary arithmetic
among the people of the settlement
bush farmers and small tradesmen
he found none of uncommon intelligence or education but some of them had a few books
which he borrowed eagerly
thus he read and reread
aesop's fables
learning to tell stories with a point and to argue by parables he read robinson crusoe
the pilgrim's progress
a short history of the united states
and weems's life of washington
to the town constable's he went to read the revised statutes of indiana
every printed page that fell into his hands he would greedily devour
and his family and friends watched him with wonder
as the uncouth boy
after his daily work
crouched in a corner of the log cabin or outside under a tree
absorbed in a book while munching his supper of corn bread
in this manner he began to gather some knowledge
and sometimes he would astonish the girls with such startling remarks as that the earth was moving around the sun
and not the sun around the earth
and they marvelled where abe could have got such queer notions
soon he also felt the impulse to write not only making extracts from books he wished to remember
but also composing little essays of his own
first he sketched these with charcoal on a wooden shovel scraped white with a drawing knife
or on basswood shingles
then he transferred them to paper
which was a scarce commodity in the lincoln household taking care to cut his expressions close
so that they might not cover too much space
a style forming method greatly to be commended
seeing boys put a burning coal on the back of a wood turtle
he was moved to write on cruelty to animals
seeing men intoxicated with whiskey
he wrote on temperance
in verse making
he tried himself
and in satire on persons offensive to him or others
satire the rustic wit of which was not always fit for ears polite
also political thoughts he put upon paper
and some of his pieces were even deemed good enough for publication in the county weekly
thus he won a neighborhood reputation as a clever young man
which he increased by his performances as a speaker
not seldom drawing upon himself the dissatisfaction of his employers by mounting a stump in the field
and keeping the farm hands from their work by little speeches in a jocose and sometimes also a serious vein
at the rude social frolics of the settlement he became an important person
telling funny
mimicking the itinerant preachers who had happened to pass by
and making his mark at wrestling matches
too for at the age of seventeen he had attained his full height
six feet four inches in his stockings
if he had any
and a terribly muscular clodhopper he was
but he was known never to use his extraordinary strength to the injury or humiliation of others rather to do them a kindly turn
or to enforce justice and fair dealing between them
all this made him a favorite in backwoods society
although in some things he appeared a little odd
to his friends
far more than any of them
he was given not only to reading
but to fits of abstraction
to quiet musing with himself
and also to strange spells of melancholy
from which he often would pass in a moment to rollicking outbursts of droll humor
but on the whole he was one of the people among whom he lived in appearance perhaps even a little more uncouth than most of them
a very tall
rawboned youth
with large features
shrivelled skin
and rebellious hair his arms and legs long
out of proportion clad in deerskin trousers
which from frequent exposure to the rain had shrunk so as to sit tightly on his limbs
leaving several inches of bluish shin exposed between their lower end and the heavy tan colored shoes the nether garment held usually by only one suspender
that was strung over a coarse homemade shirt the head covered in winter with a coonskin cap
in summer with a rough straw hat of uncertain shape
without a band
it is doubtful whether he felt himself much superior to his surroundings
although he confessed to a yearning for some knowledge of the world outside of the circle in which he lived
this wish was gratified but how
at the age of nineteen he went down the mississippi to new orleans as a flatboat hand
temporarily joining a trade many members of which at that time still took pride in being called half horse and half alligator
after his return he worked and lived in the old way until the spring of 1830
when his father moved again
this time to illinois and on the journey of fifteen days abe had to drive the ox wagon which carried the household goods
another log cabin was built
and then
fencing a field
abraham lincoln split those historic rails which were destined to play so picturesque a part in the presidential campaign twenty eight years later
having come of age
lincoln left the family
and struck out for himself
he had to take jobs whenever he could get them
the first of these carried him again as a flatboat hand to new orleans
there something happened that made a lasting impression upon his soul
he witnessed a slave auction
his heart bled
wrote one of his companions said nothing much was silent looked bad
i can say
knowing it
that it was on this trip that he formed his opinion on slavery
it run its iron in him then and there
i have heard him say so often
then he lived several years at new salem
in illinois
a small mushroom village
with a mill
some stores and whiskey shops
that rose quickly
and soon disappeared again
it was a desolate
half working and half loitering life
without any other aim than to gain food and shelter from day to day
he served as pilot on a steamboat trip
then as clerk in a store and a mill business failing
he was adrift for some time
being compelled to measure his strength with the chief bully of the neighborhood
and overcoming him
he became a noted person in that muscular community
and won the esteem and friendship of the ruling gang of ruffians to such a degree that
when the black hawk war broke out
they elected him
a young man of twenty three
captain of a volunteer company
composed mainly of roughs of their kind
he took the field
and his most noteworthy deed of valor consisted
not in killing an indian
but in protecting against his own men
at the peril of his own life
the life of an old savage who had strayed into his camp
the black hawk war over
he turned to politics
the step from the captaincy of a volunteer company to a candidacy for a seat in the legislature seemed a natural one
but his popularity
although great in new salem
had not spread far enough over the district
and he was defeated
then the wretched hand to mouth struggle began again
he set up in store business with a dissolute partner
who drank whiskey while lincoln was reading books
the result was a disastrous failure and a load of debt
thereupon he became a deputy surveyor
and was appointed postmaster of new salem
the business of the post office being so small that he could carry the incoming and outgoing mail in his hat
all this could not lift him from poverty
and his surveying instruments and horse and saddle were sold by the sheriff for debt
but while all this misery was upon him his ambition rose to higher aims
he walked many miles to borrow from a schoolmaster a grammar with which to improve his language
a lawyer lent him a copy of blackstone
and he began to study law
people would look wonderingly at the grotesque figure lying in the grass
with his feet up a tree
or sitting on a fence
absorbed in a book
he learned to construct correct sentences and made himself a jurist
at once he gained a little practice
pettifogging before a justice of the peace for friends
without expecting a fee
judicial functions
were thrust upon him
but only at horse races or wrestling matches
where his acknowledged honesty and fairness gave his verdicts undisputed authority
his popularity grew apace
and soon he could be a candidate for the legislature again
although he called himself a whig
an ardent admirer of henry clay
his clever stump speeches won him the election in the strongly democratic district
then for the first time
he thought seriously of his outward appearance
so far he had been content with a garb of kentucky jeans
not seldom ragged
usually patched
and always shabby
he borrowed some money from a friend to buy a new suit of clothes store clothes fit for a sangamon county statesman and thus adorned he set out for the state capital
to take his seat among the lawmakers
his legislative career
which stretched over several sessions for he was thrice re elected
in 1836
and 1840 was not remarkably brilliant
he did
not lack ambition
he dreamed even of making himself the de witt clinton of illinois
and he actually distinguished himself by zealous and effective work in those log rolling operations by which the young state received a general system of internal improvements in the shape of railroads
and banks
a reckless policy
burdening the state with debt
and producing the usual crop of political demoralization
but a policy characteristic of the time and the impatiently enterprising spirit of the western people
no doubt with the best intentions
but with little knowledge of the subject
simply followed the popular current
the achievement in which
he gloried most was the removal of the state government from vandalia to springfield one of those triumphs of political management which are apt to be the pride of the small politician's statesmanship
one thing
he did in which his true nature asserted itself
and which gave distinct promise of the future pursuit of high aims
against an overwhelming preponderance of sentiment in the legislature
followed by only one other member
he recorded his protest against a proslavery resolution
that protest declaring the institution of slavery to be founded on both injustice and bad policy
this was not only the irrepressible voice of his conscience it was true moral valor
too for at that time
in many parts of the west
an abolitionist was regarded as little better than a horse thief
and even abe lincoln would hardly have been forgiven his antislavery principles
had he not been known as such an uncommon good fellow
but here
in obedience to the great conviction of his life
he manifested his courage to stand alone
that courage which is the first requisite of leadership in a great cause
together with his reputation and influence as a politician grew his law practice
especially after he had removed from new salem to springfield
and associated himself with a practitioner of good standing
he had now at last won a fixed position in society
he became a successful lawyer
by his learning as a jurist than by his effectiveness as an advocate and by the striking uprightness of his character and it may truly be said that his vivid sense of truth and justice had much to do with his effectiveness as an advocate
he would refuse to act as the attorney even of personal friends when he saw the right on the other side
he would abandon cases
even during trial
when the testimony convinced him that his client was in the wrong
he would dissuade those who sought his service from pursuing an obtainable advantage when their claims seemed to him unfair
presenting his very first case in the united states circuit court
the only question being one of authority
he declared that
upon careful examination
he found all the authorities on the other side
and none on his
persons accused of crime
when he thought them guilty
he would not defend at all
attempting their defence
he was unable to put forth his powers
one notable exception is on record
when his personal sympathies had been strongly aroused
but when he felt himself to be the protector of innocence
the defender of justice
or the prosecutor of wrong
he frequently disclosed such unexpected resources of reasoning
such depth of feeling
and rose to such fervor of appeal as to astonish and overwhelm his hearers
and make him fairly irresistible
even an ordinary law argument
coming from him
seldom failed to produce the impression that he was profoundly convinced of the soundness of his position
it is not surprising that the mere appearance of so conscientious an attorney in any case should have carried
not only to juries
but even to judges
almost a presumption of right on his side
and that the people began to call him
sincerely meaning it
honest abe lincoln
in the meantime he had private sorrows and trials of a painfully afflicting nature
he had loved and been loved by a fair and estimable girl
ann rutledge
who died in the flower of her youth and beauty
and he mourned her loss with such intensity of grief that his friends feared for his reason
recovering from his morbid depression
he bestowed what he thought a new affection upon another lady
who refused him
and finally
moderately prosperous in his worldly affairs
and having prospects of political distinction before him
he paid his addresses to mary todd
of kentucky
and was accepted
but then tormenting doubts of the genuineness of his own affection for her
of the compatibility of their characters
and of their future happiness came upon him
his distress was so great that he felt himself in danger of suicide
and feared to carry a pocket knife with him and he gave mortal offence to his bride by not appearing on the appointed wedding day
now the torturing consciousness of the wrong he had done her grew unendurable
he won back her affection
ended the agony by marrying her
and became a faithful and patient husband and a good father
but it was no secret to those who knew the family well that his domestic life was full of trials
the erratic temper of his wife not seldom put the gentleness of his nature to the severest tests and these troubles and struggles
which accompanied him through all the vicissitudes of his life from the modest home in springfield to the white house at washington
adding untold private heart burnings to his public cares
and sometimes precipitating upon him incredible embarrassments in the discharge of his public duties
form one of the most pathetic features of his career
he continued to ride the circuit
read books while travelling in his buggy
told funny stories to his fellow lawyers in the tavern
chatted familiarly with his neighbors around the stove in the store and at the post office
had his hours of melancholy brooding as of old
and became more and more widely known and trusted and beloved among the people of his state for his ability as a lawyer and politician
for the uprightness of his character and the overflowing spring of sympathetic kindness in his heart
his main ambition was confessedly that of political distinction but hardly any one would at that time have seen in him the man destined to lead the nation through the greatest crisis of the century
his time had not yet come when
in 1846
he was elected to congress
in a clever speech in the house of representatives he denounced president polk for having unjustly forced war upon mexico
and he amused the committee of the whole by a witty attack upon general cass
more important was the expression he gave to his antislavery impulses by offering a bill looking to the emancipation of the slaves in the district of columbia
and by his repeated votes for the famous wilmot proviso
intended to exclude slavery from the territories acquired from mexico
but when
at the expiration of his term
in march
he left his seat
he gloomily despaired of ever seeing the day when the cause nearest to his heart would be rightly grasped by the people
and when he would be able to render any service to his country in solving the great problem
nor had his career as a member of congress in any sense been such as to gratify his ambition
if he ever had any belief in a great destiny for himself
it must have been weak at that period for he actually sought to obtain from the new whig president
general taylor
the place of commissioner of the general land office willing to bury himself in one of the administrative bureaus of the government
fortunately for the country
he failed and no less fortunately
the territorial governorship of oregon was offered to him
lincoln's protest induced him to decline it
returning to springfield
he gave himself with renewed zest to his law practice
acquiesced in the compromise of 1850 with reluctance and a mental reservation
supported in the presidential campaign of 1852 the whig candidate in some spiritless speeches
and took but a languid interest in the politics of the day
but just then his time was drawing near
the peace promised
and apparently inaugurated
by the compromise of 1850 was rudely broken by the introduction of the kansas nebraska bill in 1854
the repeal of the missouri compromise
opening the territories of the united states
the heritage of coming generations
to the invasion of slavery
suddenly revealed the whole significance of the slavery question to the people of the free states
and thrust itself into the politics of the country as the paramount issue
something like an electric shock flashed through the north
men who but a short time before had been absorbed by their business pursuits
and deprecated all political agitation
were startled out of their security by a sudden alarm
and excitedly took sides
that restless trouble of conscience about slavery
which even in times of apparent repose had secretly disturbed the souls of northern people
broke forth in an utterance louder than ever
the bonds of accustomed party allegiance gave way
antislavery democrats and antislavery whigs felt themselves drawn together by a common overpowering sentiment
and soon they began to rally in a new organization
the republican party sprang into being to meet the overruling call of the hour
then abraham lincoln's time was come
he rapidly advanced to a position of conspicuous championship in the struggle
was not owing to his virtues and abilities alone
the slavery question stirred his soul in its profoundest depths it was
as one of his intimate friends said
the only one on which he would become excited it called forth all his faculties and energies
yet there were many others who
having long and arduously fought the antislavery battle in the popular assembly
or in the press
or in the halls of congress
far surpassed him in prestige
and compared with whom he was still an obscure and untried man
his reputation
although highly honorable and well earned
had so far been essentially local
as a stump speaker in whig canvasses outside of his state he had attracted comparatively little attention but in illinois he had been recognized as one of the foremost men of the whig party
among the opponents of the nebraska bill he occupied in his state so important a position
that in 1856 he was the choice of a large majority of the anti nebraska men in the legislature for a seat in the senate of the united states which then became vacant and when he
an old whig
could not obtain the votes of the anti nebraska democrats necessary to make a majority
he generously urged his friends to transfer their votes to lyman trumbull
who was then elected
two years later
in the first national convention of the republican party
the delegation from illinois brought him forward as a candidate for the vice presidency
and he received respectable support
the name of abraham lincoln was not widely known beyond the boundaries of his own state
but now it was this local prominence in illinois that put him in a position of peculiar advantage on the battlefield of national politics
in the assault on the missouri compromise which broke down all legal barriers to the spread of slavery stephen arnold douglas was the ostensible leader and central figure and douglas was a senator from illinois
lincoln's state
douglas's national theatre of action was the senate
but in his constituency in illinois were the roots of his official position and power
what he did in the senate he had to justify before the people of illinois
in order to maintain himself in place and in illinois all eyes turned to lincoln as douglas's natural antagonist
as very young men they had come to illinois
lincoln from indiana
douglas from vermont
and had grown up together in public life
douglas as a democrat
lincoln as a whig
they had met first in vandalia
in 1834
when lincoln was in the legislature and douglas in the lobby and again in 1836
both as members of the legislature
a very able politician
of the agile
pushing sort
rose in political distinction with remarkable rapidity
in quick succession he became a member of the legislature
a state's attorney
secretary of state
a judge on the supreme bench of illinois
three times a representative in congress
and a senator of the united states when only thirty nine years old
in the national democratic convention of 1852 he appeared even as an aspirant to the nomination for the presidency
as the favorite of young america
and received a respectable vote
he had far outstripped lincoln in what is commonly called political success and in reputation
but it had frequently happened that in political campaigns lincoln felt himself impelled
or was selected by his whig friends
to answer douglas's speeches and thus the two were looked upon
in a large part of the state at least
as the representative combatants of their respective parties in the debates before popular meetings
as soon
after the passage of his kansas nebraska bill
douglas returned to illinois to defend his cause before his constituents
obeying not only his own impulse
but also general expectation
stepped forward as his principal opponent
thus the struggle about the principles involved in the kansas nebraska bill
in a broader sense
the struggle between freedom and slavery
assumed in illinois the outward form of a personal contest between lincoln and douglas and
as it continued and became more animated
that personal contest in illinois was watched with constantly increasing interest by the whole country
in 1858
douglas's senatorial term being about to expire
lincoln was formally designated by the republican convention of illinois as their candidate for the senate
to take douglas's place
and the two contestants agreed to debate the questions at issue face to face in a series of public meetings
the eyes of the whole american people were turned eagerly to that one point
and the spectacle reminded one of those lays of ancient times telling of two armies
in battle array
standing still to see their two principal champions fight out the contested cause between the lines in single combat
lincoln had then reached the full maturity of his powers
his equipment as a statesman did not embrace a comprehensive knowledge of public affairs
what he had studied he had indeed made his own
with the eager craving and that zealous tenacity characteristic of superior minds learning under difficulties
but his narrow opportunities and the unsteady life he had led during his younger years had not permitted the accumulation of large stores in his mind
it is true
in political campaigns he had occasionally spoken on the ostensible issues between the whigs and the democrats
the tariff
internal improvements
and so on
but only in a perfunctory manner
had he ever given much serious thought and study to these subjects
it is safe to assume that a mind so prolific of original conceits as his would certainly have produced some utterance upon them worth remembering
his soul had evidently never been deeply stirred by such topics
but when his moral nature was aroused
his brain developed an untiring activity until it had mastered all the knowledge within reach
as soon as the repeal of the missouri compromise had thrust the slavery question into politics as the paramount issue
lincoln plunged into an arduous study of all its legal
and moral aspects
and then his mind became a complete arsenal of argument
his rich natural gifts
trained by long and varied practice
had made him an orator of rare persuasiveness
in his immature days
he had pleased himself for a short period with that inflated
high flown style which
among the uncultivated
passes for beautiful speaking
his inborn truthfulness and his artistic instinct soon overcame that aberration and revealed to him the noble beauty and strength of simplicity
he possessed an uncommon power of clear and compact statement
which might have reminded those who knew the story of his early youth of the efforts of the poor boy
when he copied his compositions from the scraped wooden shovel
carefully to trim his expressions in order to save paper
his language had the energy of honest directness and he was a master of logical lucidity
he loved to point and enliven his reasoning by humorous illustrations
usually anecdotes of western life
of which he had an inexhaustible store at his command
these anecdotes had not seldom a flavor of rustic robustness about them
but he used them with great effect
while amusing the audience
to give life to an abstraction
to explode an absurdity
to clinch an argument
to drive home an admonition
the natural kindliness of his tone
softening prejudice and disarming partisan rancor
would often open to his reasoning a way into minds most unwilling to receive it
yet his greatest power consisted in the charm of his individuality
that charm did not
in the ordinary way
appeal to the ear or to the eye
his voice was not melodious rather shrill and piercing
especially when it rose to its high treble in moments of great animation
his figure was unhandsome
and the action of his unwieldy limbs awkward
he commanded none of the outward graces of oratory as they are commonly understood
his charm was of a different kind
it flowed from the rare depth and genuineness of his convictions and his sympathetic feelings
sympathy was the strongest element in his nature
one of his biographers
who knew him before he became president
lincoln's compassion might be stirred deeply by an object present
but never by an object absent and unseen
in the former case he would most likely extend relief
with little inquiry into the merits of the case
as he expressed it himself
it took a pain out of his own heart
 only half of this is correct
it is certainly true that he could not witness any individual distress or oppression
or any kind of suffering
without feeling a pang of pain himself
and that by relieving as much as he could the suffering of others he put an end to his own
this compassionate impulse to help he felt not only for human beings
but for every living creature
as in his boyhood he angrily reproved the boys who tormented a wood turtle by putting a burning coal on its back
we are told
he would
when a mature man
on a journey
dismount from his buggy and wade waist deep in mire to rescue a pig struggling in a swamp
appeals to his compassion were so irresistible to him
and he felt it so difficult to refuse anything when his refusal could give pain
that he himself sometimes spoke of his inability to say no as a positive weakness
but that certainly does not prove that his compassionate feeling was confined to individual cases of suffering witnessed with his own eyes
as the boy was moved by the aspect of the tortured wood turtle to compose an essay against cruelty to animals in general
so the aspect of other cases of suffering and wrong wrought up his moral nature
and set his mind to work against cruelty
and oppression in general
as his sympathy went forth to others
it attracted others to him
especially those whom he called the plain people felt themselves drawn to him by the instinctive feeling that he understood
and appreciated them
he had grown up among the poor
the lowly
the ignorant
he never ceased to remember the good souls he had met among them
and the many kindnesses they had done him
although in his mental development he had risen far above them
he never looked down upon them
how they felt and how they reasoned he knew
for so he had once felt and reasoned himself
how they could be moved he knew
for so he had once been moved himself and practised moving others
his mind was much larger than theirs
but it thoroughly comprehended theirs and while he thought much farther than they
their thoughts were ever present to him
nor had the visible distance between them grown as wide as his rise in the world would seem to have warranted
much of his backwoods speech and manners still clung to him
although he had become mr
lincoln to his later acquaintances
he was still abe to the nats and billys and daves of his youth and their familiarity neither appeared unnatural to them
nor was it in the least awkward to him
he still told and enjoyed stories similar to those he had told and enjoyed in the indiana settlement and at new salem
his wants remained as modest as they had ever been his domestic habits had by no means completely accommodated themselves to those of his more highborn wife and though the kentucky jeans apparel had long been dropped
his clothes of better material and better make would sit ill sorted on his gigantic limbs
his cotton umbrella
without a handle
and tied together with a coarse string to keep it from flapping
which he carried on his circuit rides
is said to be remembered still by some of his surviving neighbors
this rusticity of habit was utterly free from that affected contempt of refinement and comfort which self made men sometimes carry into their more affluent circumstances
to abraham lincoln it was entirely natural
and all those who came into contact with him knew it to be so
in his ways of thinking and feeling he had become a gentleman in the highest sense
but the refining process had polished but little the outward form
the plain people
still considered honest abe lincoln one of themselves and when they felt
which they no doubt frequently did
that his thoughts and aspirations moved in a sphere above their own
they were all the more proud of him
without any diminution of fellow feeling
it was this relation of mutual sympathy and understanding between lincoln and the plain people that gave him his peculiar power as a public man
and singularly fitted him
as we shall see
for that leadership which was preeminently required in the great crisis then coming on
the leadership which indeed thinks and moves ahead of the masses
but always remains within sight and sympathetic touch of them
he entered upon the campaign of 1858 better equipped than he had ever been before
he not only instinctively felt
but he had convinced himself by arduous study
that in this struggle against the spread of slavery he had right
the enlightened opinion of mankind
the constitution
and good policy on his side
it was observed that after he began to discuss the slavery question his speeches were pitched in a much loftier key than his former oratorical efforts
while he remained fond of telling funny stories in private conversation
they disappeared more and more from his public discourse
he would still now and then point his argument with expressions of inimitable quaintness
and flash out rays of kindly humor and witty irony but his general tone was serious
and rose sometimes to genuine solemnity
his masterly skill in dialectical thrust and parry
his wealth of knowledge
his power of reasoning and elevation of sentiment
disclosed in language of rare precision
and beauty
not seldom astonished his old friends
neither of the two champions could have found a more formidable antagonist than each now met in the other
douglas was by far the most conspicuous member of his party
his admirers had dubbed him the little giant
contrasting in that nickname the greatness of his mind with the smallness of his body
but though of low stature
his broad shouldered figure appeared uncommonly sturdy
and there was something lion like in the squareness of his brow and jaw
and in the defiant shake of his long hair
his loud and persistent advocacy of territorial expansion
in the name of patriotism and manifest destiny
had given him an enthusiastic following among the young and ardent
great natural parts
a highly combative temperament
and long training had made him a debater unsurpassed in a senate filled with able men
he could be as forceful in his appeals to patriotic feelings as he was fierce in denunciation and thoroughly skilled in all the baser tricks of parliamentary pugilism
while genial and rollicking in his social intercourse the idol of the boys he felt himself one of the most renowned statesmen of his time
and would frequently meet his opponents with an overbearing haughtiness
as persons more to be pitied than to be feared
in his speech opening the campaign of 1858
he spoke of lincoln
whom the republicans had dared to advance as their candidate for his place in the senate
with an air of patronizing if not contemptuous condescension
as a kind
and intelligent gentleman and a good citizen
the little giant would have been pleased to pass off his antagonist as a tall dwarf
he knew lincoln too well
to indulge himself seriously in such a delusion
but the political situation was at that moment in a curious tangle
and douglas could expect to derive from the confusion great advantage over his opponent
by the repeal of the missouri compromise
opening the territories to the ingress of slavery
douglas had pleased the south
but greatly alarmed the north
he had sought to conciliate northern sentiment by appending to his kansas nebraska bill the declaration that its intent was not to legislate slavery into any state or territory
nor to exclude it therefrom
but to leave the people thereof perfectly free to form and regulate their institutions in their own way
subject only to the constitution of the united states
this he called the great principle of popular sovereignty
when asked whether
under this act
the people of a territory
before its admission as a state
would have the right to exclude slavery
he answered
that is a question for the courts to decide
then came the famous dred scott decision
in which the supreme court held substantially that the right to hold slaves as property existed in the territories by virtue of the federal constitution
and that this right could not be denied by any act of a territorial government
of course
denied the right of the people of any territory to exclude slavery while they were in a territorial condition
and it alarmed the northern people still more
douglas recognized the binding force of the decision of the supreme court
at the same time maintaining
most illogically
that his great principle of popular sovereignty remained in force nevertheless
the proslavery people of western missouri
the so called border ruffians
had invaded kansas
set up a constitutional convention
made a constitution of an extreme pro slavery type
the lecompton constitution
refused to submit it fairly to a vote of the people of kansas
and then referred it to congress for acceptance
seeking thus to accomplish the admission of kansas as a slave state
had douglas supported such a scheme
he would have lost all foothold in the north
in the name of popular sovereignty he loudly declared his opposition to the acceptance of any constitution not sanctioned by a formal popular vote
he did not care
he said
whether slavery be voted up or down
but there must be a fair vote of the people
thus he drew upon himself the hostility of the buchanan administration
which was controlled by the proslavery interest
but he saved his northern following
more than this
not only did his democratic admirers now call him the true champion of freedom
but even some republicans of large influence
prominent among them horace greeley
sympathizing with douglas in his fight against the lecompton constitution
and hoping to detach him permanently from the proslavery interest and to force a lasting breach in the democratic party
seriously advised the republicans of illinois to give up their opposition to douglas
and to help re elect him to the senate
lincoln was not of that opinion
he believed that great popular movements can succeed only when guided by their faithful friends
and that the antislavery cause could not safely be entrusted to the keeping of one who did not care whether slavery be voted up or down
this opinion prevailed in illinois but the influences within the republican party over which it prevailed yielded only a reluctant acquiescence
if they acquiesced at all
after having materially strengthened douglas's position
such was the situation of things when the campaign of 1858 between lincoln and douglas began
lincoln opened the campaign on his side at the convention which nominated him as the republican candidate for the senatorship
with a memorable saying which sounded like a shout from the watchtower of history
a house divided against itself cannot stand
i believe this government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free
i do not expect the union to be dissolved
i do not expect the house to fall
but i expect it will cease to be divided
it will become all one thing or all the other
either the opponents of slavery will arrest the further spread of it
and place it where the public mind shall rest in the belief that it is in the course of ultimate extinction
or its advocates will push it forward
till it shall become alike lawful in all the states
old as well as new
north as well as south
then he proceeded to point out that the nebraska doctrine combined with the dred scott decision worked in the direction of making the nation all slave
here was the irrepressible conflict spoken of by seward a short time later
in a speech made famous mainly by that phrase
if there was any new discovery in it
the right of priority was lincoln's
this utterance proved not only his statesmanlike conception of the issue
but also
in his situation as a candidate
the firmness of his moral courage
the friends to whom he had read the draught of this speech before he delivered it warned him anxiously that its delivery might be fatal to his success in the election
this was shrewd advice
in the ordinary sense
while a slaveholder could threaten disunion with impunity
the mere suggestion that the existence of slavery was incompatible with freedom in the union would hazard the political chances of any public man in the north
but lincoln was inflexible
it is true
said he
and i will deliver it as written
i would rather be defeated with these expressions in my speech held up and discussed before the people than be victorious without them
the statesman was right in his far seeing judgment and his conscientious statement of the truth
but the practical politicians were also right in their prediction of the immediate effect
douglas instantly seized upon the declaration that a house divided against itself cannot stand as the main objective point of his attack
interpreting it as an incitement to a relentless sectional war
and there is no doubt that the persistent reiteration of this charge served to frighten not a few timid souls
lincoln constantly endeavored to bring the moral and philosophical side of the subject to the foreground
slavery is wrong was the keynote of all his speeches
to douglas's glittering sophism that the right of the people of a territory to have slavery or not
as they might desire
was in accordance with the principle of true popular sovereignty
he made the pointed answer
then true popular sovereignty
according to senator douglas
means that
when one man makes another man his slave
no third man shall be allowed to object
to douglas's argument that the principle which demanded that the people of a territory should be permitted to choose whether they would have slavery or not originated when god made man
and placed good and evil before him
allowing him to choose upon his own responsibility
lincoln solemnly replied
no god did not place good and evil before man
telling him to make his choice
on the contrary
god did tell him there was one tree of the fruit of which he should not eat
upon pain of death
he did not
place himself on the most advanced ground taken by the radical anti slavery men
he admitted that
under the constitution
the southern people were entitled to a congressional fugitive slave law
although he did not approve the fugitive slave law then existing
he declared also that
if slavery were kept out of the territories during their territorial existence
as it should be
and if then the people of any territory
having a fair chance and a clear field
should do such an extraordinary thing as to adopt a slave constitution
uninfluenced by the actual presence of the institution among them
he saw no alternative but to admit such a territory into the union
he declared further that
while he should be exceedingly glad to see slavery abolished in the district of columbia
he would
as a member of congress
with his present views
not endeavor to bring on that abolition except on condition that emancipation be gradual
that it be approved by the decision of a majority of voters in the district
and that compensation be made to unwilling owners
on every available occasion
he pronounced himself in favor of the deportation and colonization of the blacks
of course with their consent
he repeatedly disavowed any wish on his part to have social and political equality established between whites and blacks
on this point he summed up his views in a reply to douglas's assertion that the declaration of independence
in speaking of all men as being created equal
did not include the negroes
i do not understand the declaration of independence to mean that all men were created equal in all respects
they are not equal in color
but i believe that it does mean to declare that all men are equal in some respects they are equal in their right to life
and the pursuit of happiness
with regard to some of these subjects lincoln modified his position at a later period
and it has been suggested that he would have professed more advanced principles in his debates with douglas
had he not feared thereby to lose votes
this view can hardly be sustained
lincoln had the courage of his opinions
but he was not a radical
the man who risked his election by delivering
against the urgent protest of his friends
the speech about the house divided against itself would not have shrunk from the expression of more extreme views
had he really entertained them
it is only fair to assume that he said what at the time he really thought
and that if
his opinions changed
it was owing to new conceptions of good policy and of duty brought forth by an entirely new set of circumstances and exigencies
it is characteristic that he continued to adhere to the impracticable colonization plan even after the emancipation proclamation had already been issued
but in this contest lincoln proved himself not only a debater
but also a political strategist of the first order
the kind
and intelligent gentleman
as douglas had been pleased to call him
was by no means as harmless as a dove
he possessed an uncommon share of that worldly shrewdness which not seldom goes with genuine simplicity of character and the political experience gathered in the legislature and in congress
and in many election campaigns
added to his keen intuitions
had made him as far sighted a judge of the probable effects of a public man's sayings or doings upon the popular mind
and as accurate a calculator in estimating political chances and forecasting results
as could be found among the party managers in illinois
and now he perceived keenly the ugly dilemma in which douglas found himself
between the dred scott decision
which declared the right to hold slaves to exist in the territories by virtue of the federal constitution
and his great principle of popular sovereignty
according to which the people of a territory
if they saw fit
were to have the right to exclude slavery therefrom
douglas was twisting and squirming to the best of his ability to avoid the admission that the two were incompatible
the question then presented itself if it would be good policy for lincoln to force douglas to a clear expression of his opinion as to whether
the dred scott decision notwithstanding
the people of a territory could in any lawful way exclude slavery from its limits prior to the formation of a state constitution
lincoln foresaw and predicted what douglas would answer
that slavery could not exist in a territory unless the people desired it and gave it protection by territorial legislation
in an improvised caucus the policy of pressing the interrogatory on douglas was discussed
lincoln's friends unanimously advised against it
because the answer foreseen would sufficiently commend douglas to the people of illinois to insure his re election to the senate
but lincoln persisted
i am after larger game
said he
if douglas so answers
he can never be president
and the battle of 1860 is worth a hundred of this
the interrogatory was pressed upon douglas
and douglas did answer that
no matter what the decision of the supreme court might be on the abstract question
the people of a territory had the lawful means to introduce or exclude slavery by territorial legislation friendly or unfriendly to the institution
lincoln found it easy to show the absurdity of the proposition that
if slavery were admitted to exist of right in the territories by virtue of the supreme law
the federal constitution
it could be kept out or expelled by an inferior law
one made by a territorial legislature
again the judgment of the politicians
having only the nearest object in view
proved correct
douglas was reelected to the senate
but lincoln's judgment proved correct also
by resorting to the expedient of his unfriendly legislation doctrine
forfeited his last chance of becoming president of the united states
he might have hoped to win
by sufficient atonement
his pardon from the south for his opposition to the lecompton constitution but that he taught the people of the territories a trick by which they could defeat what the proslavery men considered a constitutional right
and that he called that trick lawful
this the slave power would never forgive
the breach between the southern and the northern democracy was thenceforth irremediable and fatal
the presidential election of 1860 approached
the struggle in kansas
and the debates in congress which accompanied it
and which not unfrequently provoked violent outbursts
continually stirred the popular excitement
within the democratic party raged the war of factions
the national democratic convention met at charleston on the 23d of april
after a struggle of ten days between the adherents and the opponents of douglas
during which the delegates from the cotton states had withdrawn
the convention adjourned without having nominated any candidates
to meet again in baltimore on the 18th of june
there was no prospect
of reconciling the hostile elements
it appeared very probable that the baltimore convention would nominate douglas
while the seceding southern democrats would set up a candidate of their own
representing extreme proslavery principles
the national republican convention assembled at chicago on the 16th of may
full of enthusiasm and hope
the situation was easily understood
the democrats would have the south
in order to succeed in the election
the republicans had to win
in addition to the states carried by fremont in 1856
those that were classed as doubtful
new jersey
and indiana
or illinois in the place of either new jersey or indiana
the most eminent republican statesmen and leaders of the time thought of for the presidency were seward and chase
both regarded as belonging to the more advanced order of antislavery men
of the two
seward had the largest following
mainly from new york
new england
and the northwest
cautious politicians doubted seriously whether seward
to whom some phrases in his speeches had undeservedly given the reputation of a reckless radical
would be able to command the whole republican vote in the doubtful states
during his long public career he had made enemies
it was evident that those who thought seward's nomination too hazardous an experiment would consider chase unavailable for the same reason
they would then look round for an available man and among the available men abraham lincoln was easily discovered to stand foremost
his great debate with douglas had given him a national reputation
the people of the east being eager to see the hero of so dramatic a contest
he had been induced to visit several eastern cities
and had astonished and delighted large and distinguished audiences with speeches of singular power and originality
an address delivered by him in the cooper institute in new york
before an audience containing a large number of important persons
was then
and has ever since been
especially praised as one of the most logical and convincing political speeches ever made in this country
the people of the west had grown proud of him as a distinctively western great man
and his popularity at home had some peculiar features which could be expected to exercise a potent charm
nor was lincoln's name as that of an available candidate left to the chance of accidental discovery
it is indeed not probable that he thought of himself as a presidential possibility
during his contest with douglas for the senatorship
as late as april
he had written to a friend who had approached him on the subject that he did not think himself fit for the presidency
the vice presidency was then the limit of his ambition
but some of his friends in illinois took the matter seriously in hand
and lincoln
after some hesitation
then formally authorized the use of his name
the matter was managed with such energy and excellent judgment that
in the convention
he had not only the whole vote of illinois to start with
but won votes on all sides without offending any rival
a large majority of the opponents of seward went over to abraham lincoln
and gave him the nomination on the third ballot
as had been foreseen
douglas was nominated by one wing of the democratic party at baltimore
while the extreme proslavery wing put breckinridge into the field as its candidate
after a campaign conducted with the energy of genuine enthusiasm on the antislavery side the united republicans defeated the divided democrats
and lincoln was elected president by a majority of fifty seven votes in the electoral colleges
the result of the election had hardly been declared when the disunion movement in the south
long threatened and carefully planned and prepared
broke out in the shape of open revolt
and nearly a month before lincoln could be inaugurated as president of the united states seven southern states had adopted ordinances of secession
formed an independent confederacy
framed a constitution for it
and elected jefferson davis its president
expecting the other slaveholding states soon to join them
on the 11th of february
lincoln left springfield for washington having
with characteristic simplicity
asked his law partner not to change the sign of the firm lincoln and herndon during the four years unavoidable absence of the senior partner
and having taken an affectionate and touching leave of his neighbors
the situation which confronted the new president was appalling
the larger part of the south in open rebellion
the rest of the slaveholding states wavering preparing to follow the revolt guided by determined
and skillful leaders the southern people
apparently full of enthusiasm and military spirit
rushing to arms
some of the forts and arsenals already in their possession the government of the union
before the accession of the new president
in the hands of men some of whom actively sympathized with the revolt
while others were hampered by their traditional doctrines in dealing with it
and really gave it aid and comfort by their irresolute attitude all the departments full of southern sympathizers and honeycombed with disloyalty the treasury empty
and the public credit at the lowest ebb the arsenals ill supplied with arms
if not emptied by treacherous practices the regular army of insignificant strength
dispersed over an immense surface
and deprived of some of its best officers by defection the navy small and antiquated
but that was not all
the threat of disunion had so often been resorted to by the slave power in years gone by that most northern people had ceased to believe in its seriousness
when disunion actually appeared as a stern reality
something like a chill swept through the whole northern country
a cry for union and peace at any price rose on all sides
democratic partisanship reiterated this cry with vociferous vehemence
and even many republicans grew afraid of the victory they had just achieved at the ballot box
and spoke of compromise
the country fairly resounded with the noise of anticoercion meetings
expressions of firm resolution from determined antislavery men were indeed not wanting
but they were for a while almost drowned by a bewildering confusion of discordant voices
even this was not all
potent influences in europe
with an ill concealed desire for the permanent disruption of the american union
eagerly espoused the cause of the southern seceders
and the two principal maritime powers of the old world seemed only to be waiting for a favorable opportunity to lend them a helping hand
this was the state of things to be mastered by honest abe lincoln when he took his seat in the presidential chair
honest abe lincoln
who was so good natured that he could not say no the greatest achievement in whose life had been a debate on the slavery question who had never been in any position of power who was without the slightest experience of high executive duties
and who had only a speaking acquaintance with the men upon whose counsel and cooperation he was to depend
nor was his accession to power under such circumstances greeted with general confidence even by the members of his party
while he had indeed won much popularity
many republicans
especially among those who had advocated seward's nomination for the presidency
saw the simple illinois lawyer take the reins of government with a feeling little short of dismay
the orators and journals of the opposition were ridiculing and lampooning him without measure
many people actually wondered how such a man could dare to undertake a task which
as he himself had said to his neighbors in his parting speech
was more difficult than that of washington himself had been
but lincoln brought to that task
aside from other uncommon qualities
the first requisite
an intuitive comprehension of its nature
while he did not indulge in the delusion that the union could be maintained or restored without a conflict of arms
he could indeed not foresee all the problems he would have to solve
he instinctively understood
by what means that conflict would have to be conducted by the government of a democracy
he knew that the impending war
whether great or small
would not be like a foreign war
exciting a united national enthusiasm
but a civil war
likely to fan to uncommon heat the animosities of party even in the localities controlled by the government that this war would have to be carried on not by means of a ready made machinery
ruled by an undisputed
absolute will
but by means to be furnished by the voluntary action of the people
armies to be formed by voluntary enlistments large sums of money to be raised by the people
through representatives
voluntarily taxing themselves trust of extraordinary power to be voluntarily granted and war measures
not seldom restricting the rights and liberties to which the citizen was accustomed
to be voluntarily accepted and submitted to by the people
or at least a large majority of them and that this would have to be kept up not merely during a short period of enthusiastic excitement but possibly through weary years of alternating success and disaster
hope and despondency
he knew that in order to steer this government by public opinion successfully through all the confusion created by the prejudices and doubts and differences of sentiment distracting the popular mind
and so to propitiate
and guide the popular will that it might give forth all the means required for the performance of his great task
he would have to take into account all the influences strongly affecting the current of popular thought and feeling
and to direct while appearing to obey
this was the kind of leadership he intuitively conceived to be needed when a free people were to be led forward en masse to overcome a great common danger under circumstances of appalling difficulty
the leadership which does not dash ahead with brilliant daring
no matter who follows
but which is intent upon rallying all the available forces
gathering in the stragglers
closing up the column
so that the front may advance well supported
for this leadership abraham lincoln was admirably fitted
better than any other american statesman of his day for he understood the plain people
with all their loves and hates
their prejudices and their noble impulses
their weaknesses and their strength
as he understood himself
and his sympathetic nature was apt to draw their sympathy to him
his inaugural address foreshadowed his official course in characteristic manner
although yielding nothing in point of principle
it was by no means a flaming antislavery manifesto
such as would have pleased the more ardent republicans
it was rather the entreaty of a sorrowing father speaking to his wayward children
in the kindliest language he pointed out to the secessionists how ill advised their attempt at disunion was
and why
for their own sakes
they should desist
almost plaintively
he told them that
while it was not their duty to destroy the union
it was his sworn duty to preserve it that the least he could do
under the obligations of his oath
was to possess and hold the property of the united states that he hoped to do this peaceably that he abhorred war for any purpose
and that they would have none unless they themselves were the aggressors
it was a masterpiece of persuasiveness
and while lincoln had accepted many valuable amendments suggested by seward
it was essentially his own
probably lincoln himself did not expect his inaugural address to have any effect upon the secessionists
for he must have known them to be resolved upon disunion at any cost
but it was an appeal to the wavering minds in the north
and upon them it made a profound impression
every candid man
however timid and halting
had to admit that the president was bound by his oath to do his duty that under that oath he could do no less than he said he would do that if the secessionists resisted such an appeal as the president had made
they were bent upon mischief
and that the government must be supported against them
the partisan sympathy with the southern insurrection which still existed in the north did indeed not disappear
but it diminished perceptibly under the influence of such reasoning
those who still resisted it did so at the risk of appearing unpatriotic
it must not be supposed
that lincoln at once succeeded in pleasing everybody
even among his friends
even among those nearest to him
in selecting his cabinet
which he did substantially before he left springfield for washington
he thought it wise to call to his assistance the strong men of his party
especially those who had given evidence of the support they commanded as his competitors in the chicago convention
in them he found at the same time representatives of the different shades of opinion within the party
and of the different elements former whigs and former democrats from which the party had recruited itself
this was sound policy under the circumstances
it might indeed have been foreseen that among the members of a cabinet so composed
troublesome disagreements and rivalries would break out
but it was better for the president to have these strong and ambitious men near him as his co operators than to have them as his critics in congress
where their differences might have been composed in a common opposition to him
as members of his cabinet he could hope to control them
and to keep them busily employed in the service of a common purpose
if he had the strength to do so
whether he did possess this strength was soon tested by a singularly rude trial
there can be no doubt that the foremost members of his cabinet
seward and chase
the most eminent republican statesmen
had felt themselves wronged by their party when in its national convention it preferred to them for the presidency a man whom
not unnaturally
they thought greatly their inferior in ability and experience as well as in service
the soreness of that disappointment was intensified when they saw this western man in the white house
with so much of rustic manner and speech as still clung to him
meeting his fellow citizens
high and low
on a footing of equality
with the simplicity of his good nature unburdened by any conventional dignity of deportment
and dealing with the great business of state in an easy going
and apparently somewhat irreverent way
they did not understand such a man
especially seward
as secretary of state
considered himself next to the chief executive
and who quickly accustomed himself to giving orders and making arrangements upon his own motion
thought it necessary that he should rescue the direction of public affairs from hands so unskilled
and take full charge of them himself
at the end of the first month of the administration he submitted a memorandum to president lincoln
which has been first brought to light by nicolay and hay
and is one of their most valuable contributions to the history of those days
in that paper seward actually told the president that at the end of a month's administration the government was still without a policy
either domestic or foreign that the slavery question should be eliminated from the struggle about the union that the matter of the maintenance of the forts and other possessions in the south should be decided with that view that explanations should be demanded categorically from the governments of spain and france
which were then preparing
one for the annexation of san domingo
and both for the invasion of mexico that if no satisfactory explanations were received war should be declared against spain and france by the united states that explanations should also be sought from russia and great britain
and a vigorous continental spirit of independence against european intervention be aroused all over the american continent that this policy should be incessantly pursued and directed by somebody that either the president should devote himself entirely to it
or devolve the direction on some member of his cabinet
whereupon all debate on this policy must end
this could be understood only as a formal demand that the president should acknowledge his own incompetency to perform his duties
content himself with the amusement of distributing post offices
and resign his power as to all important affairs into the hands of his secretary of state
it seems to day incomprehensible how a statesman of seward's calibre could at that period conceive a plan of policy in which the slavery question had no place a policy which rested upon the utterly delusive assumption that the secessionists
who had already formed their southern confederacy and were with stern resolution preparing to fight for its independence
could be hoodwinked back into the union by some sentimental demonstration against european interference a policy which
at that critical moment
would have involved the union in a foreign war
thus inviting foreign intervention in favor of the southern confederacy
and increasing tenfold its chances in the struggle for independence
but it is equally incomprehensible how seward could fail to see that this demand of an unconditional surrender was a mortal insult to the head of the government
and that by putting his proposition on paper he delivered himself into the hands of the very man he had insulted for
had lincoln
as most presidents would have done
instantly dismissed seward
and published the true reason for that dismissal
it would inevitably have been the end of seward's career
but lincoln did what not many of the noblest and greatest men in history would have been noble and great enough to do
he considered that seward was still capable of rendering great service to his country in the place in which he was
if rightly controlled
he ignored the insult
but firmly established his superiority
in his reply
which he forthwith despatched
he told seward that the administration had a domestic policy as laid down in the inaugural address with seward's approval that it had a foreign policy as traced in seward's despatches with the president's approval that if any policy was to be maintained or changed
the president
was to direct that on his responsibility and that in performing that duty the president had a right to the advice of his secretaries
seward's fantastic schemes of foreign war and continental policies lincoln brushed aside by passing them over in silence
nothing more was said
seward must have felt that he was at the mercy of a superior man that his offensive proposition had been generously pardoned as a temporary aberration of a great mind
and that he could atone for it only by devoted personal loyalty
this he did
he was thoroughly subdued
and thenceforth submitted to lincoln his despatches for revision and amendment without a murmur
the war with european nations was no longer thought of the slavery question found in due time its proper place in the struggle for the union and when
at a later period
the dismissal of seward was demanded by dissatisfied senators
who attributed to him the shortcomings of the administration
lincoln stood stoutly by his faithful secretary of state
the secretary of the treasury
a man of superb presence
of eminent ability and ardent patriotism
of great natural dignity and a certain outward coldness of manner
which made him appear more difficult of approach than he really was
did not permit his disappointment to burst out in such extravagant demonstrations
but lincoln's ways were so essentially different from his that they never became quite intelligible
and certainly not congenial to him
it might
have been better had there been
at the beginning of the administration
some decided clash between lincoln and chase
as there was between lincoln and seward
to bring on a full mutual explanation
and to make chase appreciate the real seriousness of lincoln's nature
as it was
their relations always remained somewhat formal
and chase never felt quite at ease under a chief whom he could not understand
and whose character and powers he never learned to esteem at their true value
at the same time
he devoted himself zealously to the duties of his department
and did the country arduous service under circumstances of extreme difficulty
nobody recognized this more heartily than lincoln himself
and they managed to work together until near the end of lincoln's first presidential term
when chase
after some disagreements concerning appointments to office
resigned from the treasury and
after taney's death
the president made him chief justice
the rest of the cabinet consisted of men of less eminence
who subordinated themselves more easily
in january
lincoln found it necessary to bow cameron out of the war office
and to put in his place edwin m
a man of intensely practical mind
vehement impulses
fierce positiveness
ruthless energy
immense working power
lofty patriotism
and severest devotion to duty
he accepted the war office not as a partisan
for he had never been a republican
but only to do all he could in helping to save the country
the manner in which lincoln succeeded in taming this lion to his will
by frankly recognizing his great qualities
by giving him the most generous confidence
by aiding him in his work to the full of his power
by kindly concession or affectionate persuasiveness in cases of differing opinions
when it was necessary
by firm assertions of superior authority
bears the highest testimony to his skill in the management of men
who had entered the service with rather a mean opinion of lincoln's character and capacity
became one of his warmest
most devoted
and most admiring friends
and with none of his secretaries was lincoln's intercourse more intimate
to take advice with candid readiness
and to weigh it without any pride of his own opinion
was one of lincoln's preeminent virtues but he had not long presided over his cabinet council when his was felt by all its members to be the ruling mind
the cautious policy foreshadowed in his inaugural address
and pursued during the first period of the civil war
was far from satisfying all his party friends
the ardent spirits among the union men thought that the whole north should at once be called to arms
to crush the rebellion by one powerful blow
the ardent spirits among the antislavery men insisted that
slavery having brought forth the rebellion
this powerful blow should at once be aimed at slavery
both complained that the administration was spiritless
and lamentably slow in its proceedings
lincoln reasoned otherwise
the ways of thinking and feeling of the masses
of the plain people
were constantly present to his mind
the masses
the plain people
had to furnish the men for the fighting
if fighting was to be done
he believed that the plain people would be ready to fight when it clearly appeared necessary
and that they would feel that necessity when they felt themselves attacked
he therefore waited until the enemies of the union struck the first blow
as soon as
on the 12th of april
the first gun was fired in charleston harbor on the union flag upon fort sumter
the call was sounded
and the northern people rushed to arms
lincoln knew that the plain people were now indeed ready to fight in defence of the union
but not yet ready to fight for the destruction of slavery
he declared openly that he had a right to summon the people to fight for the union
but not to summon them to fight for the abolition of slavery as a primary object and this declaration gave him numberless soldiers for the union who at that period would have hesitated to do battle against the institution of slavery
for a time he succeeded in rendering harmless the cry of the partisan opposition that the republican administration were perverting the war for the union into an abolition war
but when he went so far as to countermand the acts of some generals in the field
looking to the emancipation of the slaves in the districts covered by their commands
loud complaints arose from earnest antislavery men
who accused the president of turning his back upon the antislavery cause
many of these antislavery men will now
after a calm retrospect
be willing to admit that it would have been a hazardous policy to endanger
by precipitating a demonstrative fight against slavery
the success of the struggle for the union
lincoln's views and feelings concerning slavery had not changed
those who conversed with him intimately upon the subject at that period know that he did not expect slavery long to survive the triumph of the union
even if it were not immediately destroyed by the war
in this he was right
had the union armies achieved a decisive victory in an early period of the conflict
and had the seceded states been received back with slavery
the slave power would then have been a defeated power
defeated in an attempt to carry out its most effective threat
it would have lost its prestige
its menaces would have been hollow sound
and ceased to make any one afraid
it could no longer have hoped to expand
to maintain an equilibrium in any branch of congress
and to control the government
the victorious free states would have largely overbalanced it
it would no longer have been able to withstand the onset of a hostile age
it could no longer have ruled
and slavery had to rule in order to live
it would have lingered for a while
but it would surely have been in the course of ultimate extinction
a prolonged war precipitated the destruction of slavery a short war might only have prolonged its death struggle
lincoln saw this clearly but he saw also that
in a protracted death struggle
it might still have kept disloyal sentiments alive
bred distracting commotions
and caused great mischief to the country
he therefore hoped that slavery would not survive the war
but the question how he could rightfully employ his power to bring on its speedy destruction was to him not a question of mere sentiment
he himself set forth his reasoning upon it
at a later period
in one of his inimitable letters
i am naturally antislavery
said he
if slavery is not wrong
nothing is wrong
i cannot remember the time when i did not so think and feel
and yet i have never understood that the presidency conferred upon me an unrestricted right to act upon that judgment and feeling
it was in the oath i took that i would
to the best of my ability
and defend the constitution of the united states
i could not take the office without taking the oath
nor was it my view that i might take an oath to get power
and break the oath in using that power
i understood
in ordinary civil administration
this oath even forbade me practically to indulge my private abstract judgment on the moral question of slavery
i did understand
that my oath imposed upon me the duty of preserving
to the best of my ability
by every indispensable means
that government
that nation
of which the constitution was the organic law
i could not feel that
to the best of my ability
i had even tied to preserve the constitution if
to save slavery
or any minor matter
i should permit the wreck of government
and constitution all together
in other words
if the salvation of the government
the constitution
and the union demanded the destruction of slavery
he felt it to be not only his right
but his sworn duty to destroy it
its destruction became a necessity of the war for the union
as the war dragged on and disaster followed disaster
the sense of that necessity steadily grew upon him
early in 1862
as some of his friends well remember
he saw
what seward seemed not to see
that to give the war for the union an antislavery character was the surest means to prevent the recognition of the southern confederacy as an independent nation by european powers that
slavery being abhorred by the moral sense of civilized mankind
no european government would dare to offer so gross an insult to the public opinion of its people as openly to favor the creation of a state founded upon slavery to the prejudice of an existing nation fighting against slavery
he saw also that slavery untouched was to the rebellion an element of power
and that in order to overcome that power it was necessary to turn it into an element of weakness
he felt no assurance that the plain people were prepared for so radical a measure as the emancipation of the slaves by act of the government
and he anxiously considered that
if they were not
this great step might
by exciting dissension at the north
injure the cause of the union in one quarter more than it would help it in another
he heartily welcomed an effort made in new york to mould and stimulate public sentiment on the slavery question by public meetings boldly pronouncing for emancipation
at the same time he himself cautiously advanced with a recommendation
expressed in a special message to congress
that the united states should co operate with any state which might adopt the gradual abolishment of slavery
giving such state pecuniary aid to compensate the former owners of emancipated slaves
the discussion was started
and spread rapidly
congress adopted the resolution recommended
and soon went a step farther in passing a bill to abolish slavery in the district of columbia
the plain people began to look at emancipation on a larger scale as a thing to be considered seriously by patriotic citizens and soon lincoln thought that the time was ripe
and that the edict of freedom could be ventured upon without danger of serious confusion in the union ranks
the failure of mcclellan's movement upon richmond increased immensely the prestige of the enemy
the need of some great act to stimulate the vitality of the union cause seemed to grow daily more pressing
on july 21
lincoln surprised his cabinet with the draught of a proclamation declaring free the slaves in all the states that should be still in rebellion against the united states on the 1st of january
as to the matter itself he announced that he had fully made up his mind he invited advice only concerning the form and the time of publication
seward suggested that the proclamation
if then brought out
amidst disaster and distress
would sound like the last shriek of a perishing cause
lincoln accepted the suggestion
and the proclamation was postponed
another defeat followed
the second at bull run
but when
after that battle
the confederate army
under lee
crossed the potomac and invaded maryland
lincoln vowed in his heart that
if the union army were now blessed with success
the decree of freedom should surely be issued
the victory of antietam was won on september 17
and the preliminary emancipation proclamation came forth on the a 22d
it was lincoln's own resolution and act but practically it bound the nation
and permitted no step backward
in spite of its limitations
it was the actual abolition of slavery
thus he wrote his name upon the books of history with the title dearest to his heart
the liberator of the slave
it is true
the great proclamation
which stamped the war as one for union and freedom
did not at once mark the turning of the tide on the field of military operations
there were more disasters
fredericksburg and chancellorsville
but with gettysburg and vicksburg the whole aspect of the war changed
step by step
now more slowly
then more rapidly
but with increasing steadiness
the flag of the union advanced from field to field toward the final consummation
the decree of emancipation was naturally followed by the enlistment of emancipated negroes in the union armies
this measure had a anther reaching effect than merely giving the union armies an increased supply of men
the laboring force of the rebellion was hopelessly disorganized
the war became like a problem of arithmetic
as the union armies pushed forward
the area from which the southern confederacy could draw recruits and supplies constantly grew smaller
while the area from which the union recruited its strength constantly grew larger and everywhere
even within the southern lines
the union had its allies
the fate of the rebellion was then virtually decided but it still required much bloody work to convince the brave warriors who fought for it that they were really beaten
neither did the emancipation proclamation forthwith command universal assent among the people who were loyal to the union
there were even signs of a reaction against the administration in the fall elections of 1862
seemingly justifying the opinion
entertained by many
that the president had really anticipated the development of popular feeling
the cry that the war for the union had been turned into an abolition war was raised again by the opposition
and more loudly than ever
but the good sense and patriotic instincts of the plain people gradually marshalled themselves on lincoln's side
and he lost no opportunity to help on this process by personal argument and admonition
there never has been a president in such constant and active contact with the public opinion of the country
as there never has been a president who
while at the head of the government
remained so near to the people
beyond the circle of those who had long known him the feeling steadily grew that the man in the white house was honest abe lincoln still
and that every citizen might approach him with complaint
or advice
without danger of meeting a rebuff from power proud authority
or humiliating condescension and this privilege was used by so many and with such unsparing freedom that only superhuman patience could have endured it all
there are men now living who would to day read with amazement
if not regret
what they ventured to say or write to him
but lincoln repelled no one whom he believed to speak to him in good faith and with patriotic purpose
no good advice would go unheeded
no candid criticism would offend him
no honest opposition
while it might pain him
would produce a lasting alienation of feeling between him and the opponent
it may truly be said that few men in power have ever been exposed to more daring attempts to direct their course
to severer censure of their acts
and to more cruel misrepresentation of their motives
and all this he met with that good natured humor peculiarly his own
and with untiring effort to see the right and to impress it upon those who differed from him
the conversations he had and the correspondence he carried on upon matters of public interest
not only with men in official position
but with private citizens
were almost unceasing
and in a large number of public letters
written ostensibly to meetings
or committees
or persons of importance
he addressed himself directly to the popular mind
most of these letters stand among the finest monuments of our political literature
thus he presented the singular spectacle of a president who
in the midst of a great civil war
with unprecedented duties weighing upon him
was constantly in person debating the great features of his policy with the people
while in this manner he exercised an ever increasing influence upon the popular understanding
his sympathetic nature endeared him more and more to the popular heart
in vain did journals and speakers of the opposition represent him as a lightminded trifler
who amused himself with frivolous story telling and coarse jokes
while the blood of the people was flowing in streams
the people knew that the man at the head of affairs
on whose haggard face the twinkle of humor so frequently changed into an expression of profoundest sadness
was more than any other deeply distressed by the suffering he witnessed that he felt the pain of every wound that was inflicted on the battlefield
and the anguish of every woman or child who had lost husband or father that whenever he could he was eager to alleviate sorrow
and that his mercy was never implored in vain
they looked to him as one who was with them and of them in all their hopes and fears
their joys and sorrows
who laughed with them and wept with them and as his heart was theirs so their hearts turned to him
his popularity was far different from that of washington
who was revered with awe
or that of jackson
the unconquerable hero
for whom party enthusiasm never grew weary of shouting
to abraham lincoln the people became bound by a genuine sentimental attachment
it was not a matter of respect
or confidence
or party pride
for this feeling spread far beyond the boundary lines of his party it was an affair of the heart
independent of mere reasoning
when the soldiers in the field or their folks at home spoke of father abraham
there was no cant in it
they felt that their president was really caring for them as a father would
and that they could go to him
every one of them
as they would go to a father
and talk to him of what troubled them
sure to find a willing ear and tender sympathy
their president
and his cause
and his endeavors
and his success gradually became to them almost matters of family concern
and this popularity carried him triumphantly through the presidential election of 1864
in spite of an opposition within his own party which at first seemed very formidable
many of the radical antislavery men were never quite satisfied with lincoln's ways of meeting the problems of the time
they were very earnest and mostly very able men
who had positive ideas as to how this rebellion should be put down
they would not recognize the necessity of measuring the steps of the government according to the progress of opinion among the plain people
they criticised lincoln's cautious management as irresolute
lacking in definite purpose and in energy he should not have delayed emancipation so long he should not have confided important commands to men of doubtful views as to slavery he should have authorized military commanders to set the slaves free as they went on he dealt too leniently with unsuccessful generals he should have put down all factious opposition with a strong hand instead of trying to pacify it he should have given the people accomplished facts instead of arguing with them
and so on
it is true
these criticisms were not always entirely unfounded
lincoln's policy had
with the virtues of democratic government
some of its weaknesses
which in the presence of pressing exigencies were apt to deprive governmental action of the necessary vigor and his kindness of heart
his disposition always to respect the feelings of others
frequently made him recoil from anything like severity
even when severity was urgently called for
but many of his radical critics have since then revised their judgment sufficiently to admit that lincoln's policy was
on the whole
the wisest and safest that a policy of heroic methods
while it has sometimes accomplished great results
could in a democracy like ours be maintained only by constant success that it would have quickly broken down under the weight of disaster that it might have been successful from the start
had the union
at the beginning of the conflict
had its grants and shermans and sheridans
its farraguts and porters
fully matured at the head of its forces but that
as the great commanders had to be evolved slowly from the developments of the war
constant success could not be counted upon
and it was best to follow a policy which was in friendly contact with the popular force
and therefore more fit to stand trial of misfortune on the battlefield
but at that period they thought differently
and their dissatisfaction with lincoln's doings was greatly increased by the steps he took toward the reconstruction of rebel states then partially in possession of the union forces
in december
lincoln issued an amnesty proclamation
offering pardon to all implicated in the rebellion
with certain specified exceptions
on condition of their taking and maintaining an oath to support the constitution and obey the laws of the united states and the proclamations of the president with regard to slaves and also promising that when
in any of the rebel states
a number of citizens equal to one tenth of the voters in 1860 should re establish a state government in conformity with the oath above mentioned
such should be recognized by the executive as the true government of the state
the proclamation seemed at first to be received with general favor
but soon another scheme of reconstruction
much more stringent in its provisions
was put forward in the house of representatives by henry winter davis
benjamin wade championed it in the senate
it passed in the closing moments of the session in july
and lincoln
instead of making it a law by his signature
embodied the text of it in a proclamation as a plan of reconstruction worthy of being earnestly considered
the differences of opinion concerning this subject had only intensified the feeling against lincoln which had long been nursed among the radicals
and some of them openly declared their purpose of resisting his re election to the presidency
similar sentiments were manifested by the advanced antislavery men of missouri
in their hot faction fight with the conservatives of that state
had not received from lincoln the active support they demanded
still another class of union men
mainly in the east
gravely shook their heads when considering the question whether lincoln should be re elected
they were those who cherished in their minds an ideal of statesmanship and of personal bearing in high office with which
in their opinion
lincoln's individuality was much out of accord
they were shocked when they heard him cap an argument upon grave affairs of state with a story about a man out in sangamon county
a story
to be sure
strikingly clinching his point
but sadly lacking in dignity
they could not understand the man who was capable
in opening a cabinet meeting
of reading to his secretaries a funny chapter from a recent book of artemus ward
with which in an unoccupied moment he had relieved his care burdened mind
and who then solemnly informed the executive council that he had vowed in his heart to issue a proclamation emancipating the slaves as soon as god blessed the union arms with another victory
they were alarmed at the weakness of a president who would indeed resist the urgent remonstrances of statesmen against his policy
but could not resist the prayer of an old woman for the pardon of a soldier who was sentenced to be shot for desertion
such men
mostly sincere and ardent patriots
not only wished
but earnestly set to work
to prevent lincoln's renomination
not a few of them actually believed
in 1863
if the national convention of the union party were held then
lincoln would not be supported by the delegation of a single state
but when the convention met at baltimore
in june
the voice of the people was heard
on the first ballot lincoln received the votes of the delegations from all the states except missouri and even the missourians turned over their votes to him before the result of the ballot was declared
but even after his renomination the opposition to lincoln within the ranks of the union party did not subside
a convention
called by the dissatisfied radicals in missouri
and favored by men of a similar way of thinking in other states
had been held already in may
and had nominated as its candidate for the presidency general fremont
did not attract a strong following
but opposition movements from different quarters appeared more formidable
henry winter davis and benjamin wade assailed lincoln in a flaming manifesto
other union men
of undoubted patriotism and high standing
persuaded themselves
and sought to persuade the people
that lincoln's renomination was ill advised and dangerous to the union cause
as the democrats had put off their convention until the 29th of august
the union party had
during the larger part of the summer
no opposing candidate and platform to attack
and the political campaign languished
neither were the tidings from the theatre of war of a cheering character
the terrible losses suffered by grant's army in the battles of the wilderness spread general gloom
sherman seemed for a while to be in a precarious position before atlanta
the opposition to lincoln within the union party grew louder in its complaints and discouraging predictions
earnest demands were heard that his candidacy should be withdrawn
lincoln himself
not knowing how strongly the masses were attached to him
was haunted by dark forebodings of defeat
then the scene suddenly changed as if by magic
the democrats
in their national convention
declared the war a failure
peace at any price
and nominated on such a platform general mcclellan as their candidate
their convention had hardly adjourned when the capture of atlanta gave a new aspect to the military situation
it was like a sun ray bursting through a dark cloud
the rank and file of the union party rose with rapidly growing enthusiasm
the song we are coming
father abraham
three hundred thousand strong
resounded all over the land
long before the decisive day arrived
the result was beyond doubt
and lincoln was re elected president by overwhelming majorities
the election over even his severest critics found themselves forced to admit that lincoln was the only possible candidate for the union party in 1864
and that neither political combinations nor campaign speeches
nor even victories in the field
were needed to insure his success
the plain people had all the while been satisfied with abraham lincoln
they confided in him they loved him they felt themselves near to him they saw personified in him the cause of union and freedom and they went to the ballot box for him in their strength
the hour of triumph called out the characteristic impulses of his nature
the opposition within the union party had stung him to the quick
now he had his opponents before him
baffled and humiliated
not a moment did he lose to stretch out the hand of friendship to all
now that the election is over
he said
in response to a serenade
may not all
having a common interest
reunite in a common effort to save our common country
for my own part
i have striven
and will strive
to place no obstacle in the way
so long as i have been here i have not willingly planted a thorn in any man's bosom
while i am deeply sensible to the high compliment of a re election
it adds nothing to my satisfaction that any other man may be pained or disappointed by the result
may i ask those who were with me to join with me in the same spirit toward those who were against me
this was abraham lincoln's character as tested in the furnace of prosperity
the war was virtually decided
but not yet ended
sherman was irresistibly carrying the union flag through the south
grant had his iron hand upon the ramparts of richmond
the days of the confederacy were evidently numbered
only the last blow remained to be struck
then lincoln's second inauguration came
and with it his second inaugural address
lincoln's famous gettysburg speech has been much and justly admired
but far greater
as well as far more characteristic
was that inaugural in which he poured out the whole devotion and tenderness of his great soul
it had all the solemnity of a father's last admonition and blessing to his children before he lay down to die
these were its closing words
fondly do we hope
fervently do we pray
that this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away
yet if god wills that it continue until all the wealth piled up by the bondman's two hundred and fifty years of unrequited toil shall be sunk
and until every drop of blood drawn with the lash shall be paid by another drawn with the sword
as was said three thousand years ago
so still it must be said
the judgments of the lord are true and righteous altogether
 with malice toward none
with charity for all
with firmness in the right as god gives us to see the right
let us strive to finish the work we are in to bind up the nation's wounds to care for him who shall have borne the battle
and for his widow and his orphan to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations
this was like a sacred poem
no american president had ever spoken words like these to the american people
america never had a president who found such words in the depth of his heart
now followed the closing scenes of the war
the southern armies fought bravely to the last
but all in vain
richmond fell
lincoln himself entered the city on foot
accompanied only by a few officers and a squad of sailors who had rowed him ashore from the flotilla in the james river
a negro picked up on the way serving as a guide
never had the world seen a more modest conqueror and a more characteristic triumphal procession
no army with banners and drums
only a throng of those who had been slaves
hastily run together
escorting the victorious chief into the capital of the vanquished foe
we are told that they pressed around him
kissed his hands and his garments
and shouted and danced for joy
while tears ran down the president's care furrowed cheeks
a few days more brought the surrender of lee's army
and peace was assured
the people of the north were wild with joy
everywhere festive guns were booming
bells pealing
the churches ringing with thanksgivings
and jubilant multitudes thronging the thoroughfares
when suddenly the news flashed over the land that abraham lincoln had been murdered
the people were stunned by the blow
then a wail of sorrow went up such as america had never heard before
thousands of northern households grieved as if they had lost their dearest member
many a southern man cried out in his heart that his people had been robbed of their best friend in their humiliation and distress
when abraham lincoln was struck down
it was as if the tender affection which his countrymen bore him had inspired all nations with a common sentiment
all civilized mankind stood mourning around the coffin of the dead president
many of those
here and abroad
who not long before had ridiculed and reviled him were among the first to hasten on with their flowers of eulogy
and in that universal chorus of lamentation and praise there was not a voice that did not tremble with genuine emotion
never since washington's death had there been such unanimity of judgment as to a man's virtues and greatness and even washington's death
although his name was held in greater reverence
did not touch so sympathetic a chord in the people's hearts
nor can it be said that this was owing to the tragic character of lincoln's end
it is true
the death of this gentlest and most merciful of rulers by the hand of a mad fanatic was well apt to exalt him beyond his merits in the estimation of those who loved him
and to make his renown the object of peculiarly tender solicitude
but it is also true that the verdict pronounced upon him in those days has been affected little by time
and that historical inquiry has served rather to increase than to lessen the appreciation of his virtues
his abilities
his services
giving the fullest measure of credit to his great ministers
to seward for his conduct of foreign affairs
to chase for the management of the finances under terrible difficulties
to stanton for the performance of his tremendous task as war secretary
and readily acknowledging that without the skill and fortitude of the great commanders
and the heroism of the soldiers and sailors under them
success could not have been achieved
the historian still finds that lincoln's judgment and will were by no means governed by those around him that the most important steps were owing to his initiative that his was the deciding and directing mind and that it was pre eminently he whose sagacity and whose character enlisted for the administration in its struggles the countenance
the sympathy
and the support of the people
it is found
that his judgment on military matters was astonishingly acute
and that the advice and instructions he gave to the generals commanding in the field would not seldom have done honor to the ablest of them
without overlooking
or palliating
or excusing any of his shortcomings or mistakes
continues to place him foremost among the saviours of the union and the liberators of the slave
more than that
it awards to him the merit of having accomplished what but few political philosophers would have recognized as possible
of leading the republic through four years of furious civil conflict without any serious detriment to its free institutions
he was
while president
violently denounced by the opposition as a tyrant and a usurper
for having gone beyond his constitutional powers in authorizing or permitting the temporary suppression of newspapers
and in wantonly suspending the writ of habeas corpus and resorting to arbitrary arrests
nobody should be blamed who
when such things are done
in good faith and from patriotic motives protests against them
in a republic
arbitrary stretches of power
even when demanded by necessity
should never be permitted to pass without a protest on the one hand
and without an apology on the other
it is well they did not so pass during our civil war
that arbitrary measures were resorted to is true
that they were resorted to most sparingly
and only when the government thought them absolutely required by the safety of the republic
will now hardly be denied
but certain it is that the history of the world does not furnish a single example of a government passing through so tremendous a crisis as our civil war was with so small a record of arbitrary acts
and so little interference with the ordinary course of law outside the field of military operations
no american president ever wielded such power as that which was thrust into lincoln's hands
it is to be hoped that no american president ever will have to be entrusted with such power again
but no man was ever entrusted with it to whom its seductions were less dangerous than they proved to be to abraham lincoln
with scrupulous care he endeavored
even under the most trying circumstances
to remain strictly within the constitutional limitations of his authority and whenever the boundary became indistinct
or when the dangers of the situation forced him to cross it
he was equally careful to mark his acts as exceptional measures
justifiable only by the imperative necessities of the civil war
so that they might not pass into history as precedents for similar acts in time of peace
it is an unquestionable fact that during the reconstruction period which followed the war
more things were done capable of serving as dangerous precedents than during the war itself
thus it may truly be said of him not only that under his guidance the republic was saved from disruption and the country was purified of the blot of slavery
but that
during the stormiest and most perilous crisis in our history
he so conducted the government and so wielded his almost dictatorial power as to leave essentially intact our free institutions in all things that concern the rights and liberties of the citizens
he understood well the nature of the problem
in his first message to congress he defined it in admirably pointed language
must a government be of necessity too strong for the liberties of its own people
or too weak to maintain its own existence
is there in all republics this inherent weakness
this question he answered in the name of the great american republic
as no man could have answered it better
with a triumphant no
it has been said that abraham lincoln died at the right moment for his fame
however that may be
he had
at the time of his death
certainly not exhausted his usefulness to his country
he was probably the only man who could have guided the nation through the perplexities of the reconstruction period in such a manner as to prevent in the work of peace the revival of the passions of the war
he would indeed not have escaped serious controversy as to details of policy but he could have weathered it far better than any other statesman of his time
for his prestige with the active politicians had been immensely strengthened by his triumphant re election and
what is more important
he would have been supported by the confidence of the victorious northern people that he would do all to secure the safety of the union and the rights of the emancipated negro
and at the same time by the confidence of the defeated southern people that nothing would be done by him from motives of vindictiveness
or of unreasoning fanaticism
or of a selfish party spirit
with malice toward none
with charity for all
the foremost of the victors would have personified in himself the genius of reconciliation
he might have rendered the country a great service in another direction
a few days after the fall of richmond
he pointed out to a friend the crowd of office seekers besieging his door
look at that
said he
now we have conquered the rebellion
but here you see something that may become more dangerous to this republic than the rebellion itself
it is true
lincoln as president did not profess what we now call civil service reform principles
he used the patronage of the government in many cases avowedly to reward party work
in many others to form combinations and to produce political effects advantageous to the union cause
and in still others simply to put the right man into the right place
but in his endeavors to strengthen the union cause
and in his search for able and useful men for public duties
he frequently went beyond the limits of his party
and gradually accustomed himself to the thought that
while party service had its value
considerations of the public interest were
as to appointments to office
of far greater consequence
there had been such a mingling of different political elements in support of the union during the civil war that lincoln
standing at the head of that temporarily united motley mass
hardly felt himself
in the narrow sense of the term
a party man
and as he became strongly impressed with the dangers brought upon the republic by the use of public offices as party spoils
it is by no means improbable that
had he survived the all absorbing crisis and found time to turn to other objects
one of the most important reforms of later days would have been pioneered by his powerful authority
this was not to be
but the measure of his achievements was full enough for immortality
to the younger generation abraham lincoln has already become a half mythical figure
in the haze of historic distance
grows to more and more heroic proportions
but also loses in distinctness of outline and feature
this is indeed the common lot of popular heroes but the lincoln legend will be more than ordinarily apt to become fanciful
as his individuality
assembling seemingly incongruous qualities and forces in a character at the same time grand and most lovable
was so unique
and his career so abounding in startling contrasts
as the state of society in which abraham lincoln grew up passes away
the world will read with increasing wonder of the man who
not only of the humblest origin
but remaining the simplest and most unpretending of citizens
was raised to a position of power unprecedented in our history who was the gentlest and most peace loving of mortals
unable to see any creature suffer without a pang in his own breast
and suddenly found himself called to conduct the greatest and bloodiest of our wars who wielded the power of government when stern resolution and relentless force were the order of the day and then won and ruled the popular mind and heart by the tender sympathies of his nature who was a cautious conservative by temperament and mental habit
and led the most sudden and sweeping social revolution of our time who
preserving his homely speech and rustic manner even in the most conspicuous position of that period
drew upon himself the scoffs of polite society
and then thrilled the soul of mankind with utterances of wonderful beauty and grandeur who
in his heart the best friend of the defeated south
was murdered because a crazy fanatic took him for its most cruel enemy who
while in power
was beyond measure lampooned and maligned by sectional passion and an excited party spirit
and around whose bier friend and foe gathered to praise him which they have since never ceased to do as one of the greatest of americans and the best of men
abraham lincoln
by joseph h
choate this address was delivered before the edinburgh philosophical institution
november 13
it is included in this set with the courteous permission of the author and of messrs
thomas y
crowell company
abraham lincoln
when you asked me to deliver the inaugural address on this occasion
i recognized that i owed this compliment to the fact that i was the official representative of america
and in selecting a subject i ventured to think that i might interest you for an hour in a brief study in popular government
as illustrated by the life of the most american of all americans
i therefore offer no apology for asking your attention to abraham lincoln to his unique character and the part he bore in two important achievements of modern history
the preservation of the integrity of the american union and the emancipation of the colored race
during his brief term of power he was probably the object of more abuse
and ridicule than any other man in the world but when he fell by the hand of an assassin
at the very moment of his stupendous victory
all the nations of the earth vied with one another in paying homage to his character
and the thirty five years that have since elapsed have established his place in history as one of the great benefactors not of his own country alone
but of the human race
one of many noble utterances upon the occasion of his death was that in which 'punch' made its magnanimous recantation of the spirit with which it had pursued him
beside this corpse that bears for winding sheet the stars and stripes he lived to rear anew
between the mourners at his head and feet
scurrile jester
is there room for you
he had lived to shame me from my sneer
to lame my pencil
and confute my pen to make me own this hind of princes peer
this rail splitter a true born king of men
fiction can furnish no match for the romance of his life
and biography will be searched in vain for such startling vicissitudes of fortune
so great power and glory won out of such humble beginnings and adverse circumstances
doubtless you are all familiar with the salient points of his extraordinary career
in the zenith of his fame he was the wise
successful ruler of men exercising more power than any monarch of his time
not for himself
but for the good of the people who had placed it in his hands commander in chief of a vast military power
which waged with ultimate success the greatest war of the century the triumphant champion of popular government
the deliverer of four millions of his fellowmen from bondage honored by mankind as statesman
and liberator
let us glance now at the first half of the brief life of which this was the glorious and happy consummation
nothing could be more squalid and miserable than the home in which abraham lincoln was born a one roomed cabin without floor or window in what was then the wilderness of kentucky
in the heart of that frontier life which swiftly moved westward from the alleghanies to the mississippi
always in advance of schools and churches
of books and money
of railroads and newspapers
of all things which are generally regarded as the comforts and even necessaries of life
his father
and thriftless
content if he could keep soul and body together for himself and his family
was ever seeking
without success
to better his unhappy condition by moving on from one such scene of dreary desolation to another
the rude society which surrounded them was not much better
the struggle for existence was hard
and absorbed all their energies
they were fighting the forest
the wild beast
and the retreating savage
from the time when he could barely handle tools until he attained his majority
lincoln's life was that of a simple farm laborer
poorly clad
and fed
at work either on his father's wretched farm or hired out to neighboring farmers
but in spite
or perhaps by means
of this rude environment
he grew to be a stalwart giant
reaching six feet four at nineteen
and fabulous stories are told of his feats of strength
with the growth of this mighty frame began that strange education which in his ripening years was to qualify him for the great destiny that awaited him
and the development of those mental faculties and moral endowments which
by the time he reached middle life
were to make him the sagacious
and triumphant leader of a great nation in the crisis of its fate
his whole schooling
obtained during such odd times as could be spared from grinding labor
did not amount in all to as much as one year
and the quality of the teaching was of the lowest possible grade
including only the elements of reading
and ciphering
but out of these simple elements
when rightly used by the right man
education is achieved
and lincoln knew how to use them
as so often happens
he seemed to take warning from his father's unfortunate example
untiring industry
an insatiable thirst for knowledge
and an ever growing desire to rise above his surroundings
were early manifestations of his character
books were almost unknown in that community
but the bible was in every house
and somehow or other pilgrim's progress
aesop's fables
a history of the united states
and a life of washington fell into his hands
he trudged on foot many miles through the wilderness to borrow an english grammar
and is said to have devoured greedily the contents of the statutes of indiana that fell in his way
these few volumes he read and reread and his power of assimilation was great
to be shut in with a few books and to master them thoroughly sometimes does more for the development of character than freedom to range at large
in a cursory and indiscriminate way
through wide domains of literature
this youth's mind
at any rate
was thoroughly saturated with biblical knowledge and biblical language
in after life
he used with great readiness and effect
but it was the constant use of the little knowledge which he had that developed and exercised his mental powers
after the hard day's work was done
while others slept
he toiled on
always reading or writing
from an early age he did his own thinking and made up his own mind invaluable traits in the future president
paper was such a scarce commodity that
by the evening firelight
he would write and cipher on the back of a wooden shovel
and then shave it off to make room for more
by and by
as he approached manhood
he began speaking in the rude gatherings of the neighborhood
and so laid the foundation of that art of persuading his fellow men which was one rich result of his education
and one great secret of his subsequent success
accustomed as we are in these days of steam and telegraphs to have every intelligent boy survey the whole world each morning before breakfast
and inform himself as to what is going on in every nation
it is hardly possible to conceive how benighted and isolated was the condition of the community at pigeon creek in indiana
of which the family of lincoln's father formed a part
or how eagerly an ambitious and high spirited boy
such as he
must have yearned to escape
the first glimpse that he ever got of any world beyond the narrow confines of his home was in 1828
at the age of nineteen
when a neighbor employed him to accompany his son down the river to new orleans to dispose of a flatboat of produce a commission which he discharged with great success
shortly after his return from this his first excursion into the outer world
his father
tired of failure in indiana
packed his family and all his worldly goods into a single wagon drawn by two yoke of oxen
and after a fourteen days' tramp through the wilderness
pitched his camp once more
in illinois
here abraham
having come of age and being now his own master
rendered the last service of his minority by ploughing the fifteen acre lot and splitting from the tall walnut trees of the primeval forest enough rails to surround the little clearing with a fence
such was the meagre outfit of this coming leader of men
at the age when the future british prime minister or statesman emerges from the university as a double first or senior wrangler
with every advantage that high training and broad culture and association with the wisest and the best of men and women can give
and enters upon some form of public service on the road to usefulness and honor
the university course being only the first stage of the public training
so lincoln
at twenty one
had just begun his preparation for the public life to which he soon began to aspire
for some years yet he must continue to earn his daily bread by the sweat of his brow
having absolutely no means
no home
no friend to consult
more farm work as a hired hand
a clerkship in a village store
the running of a mill
another trip to new orleans on a flatboat of his own contriving
a pilot's berth on the river these were the means by which he subsisted until
in the summer of 1832
when he was twenty three years of age
an event occurred which gave him public recognition
the black hawk war broke out
the governor of illinois calling for volunteers to repel the band of savages whose leader bore that name
lincoln enlisted and was elected captain by his comrades
among whom he had already established his supremacy by signal feats of strength and more than one successful single combat
during the brief hostilities he was engaged in no battle and won no military glory
but his local leadership was established
the same year he offered himself as a candidate for the legislature of illinois
but failed at the polls
yet his vast popularity with those who knew him was manifest
the district consisted of several counties
but the unanimous vote of the people of his own county was for lincoln
another unsuccessful attempt at store keeping was followed by better luck at surveying
until his horse and instruments were levied upon under execution for the debts of his business adventure
i have been thus detailed in sketching his early years because upon these strange foundations the structure of his great fame and service was built
in the place of a school and university training fortune substituted these trials
and struggles as a preparation for the great work which he had to do
it turned out to be exactly what the emergency required
ten years instead at the public school and the university certainly never could have fitted this man for the unique work which was to be thrown upon him
some other moses would have had to lead us to our jordan
to the sight of our promised land of liberty
at the age of twenty five he became a member of the legislature of illinois
and so continued for eight years
in the meantime
qualified himself by reading such law books as he could borrow at random for he was too poor to buy any to be called to the bar
for his second quarter of a century during which a single term in congress introduced him into the arena of national questions he gave himself up to law and politics
in spite of his soaring ambition
his two years in congress gave him no premonition of the great destiny that awaited him
and at its close
in 1849
we find him an unsuccessful applicant to the president for appointment as commissioner of the general land office a purely administrative bureau a fortunate escape for himself and for his country
year by year his knowledge and power
his experience and reputation extended
and his mental faculties seemed to grow by what they fed on
his power of persuasion
which had always been marked
was developed to an extraordinary degree
now that he became engaged in congenial questions and subjects
little by little he rose to prominence at the bar
and became the most effective public speaker in the west
not that he possessed any of the graces of the orator but his logic was invincible
and his clearness and force of statement impressed upon his hearers the convictions of his honest mind
while his broad sympathies and sparkling and genial humor made him a universal favorite as far and as fast as his acquaintance extended
these twenty years that elapsed from the time of his establishment as a lawyer and legislator in springfield
the new capital of illinois
furnished a fitting theatre for the development and display of his great faculties
with his new and enlarged opportunities
he obviously grew in mental stature in this second period of his career
as if to compensate for the absolute lack of advantages under which he had suffered in youth
as his powers enlarged
his reputation extended
for he was always before the people
felt a warm sympathy with all that concerned them
took a zealous part in the discussion of every public question
and made his personal influence ever more widely and deeply felt
my brethren of the legal profession will naturally ask me
how could this rough backwoodsman
whose youth had been spent in the forest or on the farm and the flatboat
without culture or training
education or study
by the random reading
on the wing
of a few miscellaneous law books
become a learned and accomplished lawyer
he never did
he never would have earned his salt as a 'writer' for the 'signet
nor have won a place as advocate in the court of session
where the technique of the profession has reached its highest perfection
and centuries of learning and precedent are involved in the equipment of a lawyer
when asked by an anxious young mother
when should the education of a child begin
replied
at least two centuries before it is born
and so i am sure it is with the scots lawyer
but not so in illinois in 1840
between 1830 and 1880 its population increased twenty fold
and when lincoln began practising law in springfield in 1837
life in illinois was very crude and simple
and so were the courts and the administration of justice
books and libraries were scarce
but the people loved justice
upheld the law
and followed the courts
and soon found their favorites among the advocates
the fundamental principles of the common law
as set forth by blackstone and chitty
were not so difficult to acquire and brains
common sense
force of character
tenacity of purpose
ready wit and power of speech did the rest
and supplied all the deficiencies of learning
the lawsuits of those days were extremely simple
and the principles of natural justice were mainly relied on to dispose of them at the bar and on the bench
without resort to technical learning
corporations absorbing the chief business of the community
combined and inherited wealth
with all the subtle and intricate questions they breed
had not yet come in and so the professional agents and the equipment which they require were not needed
but there were many highly educated and powerful men at the bar of illinois
even in those early days
whom the spirit of enterprise had carried there in search of fame and fortune
it was by constant contact and conflict with these that lincoln acquired professional strength and skill
every community and every age creates its own bar
entirely adequate for its present uses and necessities
so in illinois
as the population and wealth of the state kept on doubling and quadrupling
its bar presented a growing abundance of learning and science and technical skill
the early practitioners grew with its growth and mastered the requisite knowledge
chicago soon grew to be one of the largest and richest and certainly the most intensely active city on the continent
and if any of my professional friends here had gone there in lincoln's later years
to try or argue a cause
or transact other business
with any idea that edinburgh or london had a monopoly of legal learning
or subtlety
they would certainly have found their mistake
in those early days in the west
every lawyer
especially every court lawyer
was necessarily a politician
constantly engaged in the public discussion of the many questions evolved from the rapid development of town
and federal affairs
then and there
in this regard
public discussion supplied the place which the universal activity of the press has since monopolized
and the public speaker who
by clearness
and wit could make himself felt on the questions of the day would rapidly come to the front
in the absence of that immense variety of popular entertainments which now feed the public taste and appetite
the people found their chief amusement in frequenting the courts and public and political assemblies
in either place
he who impressed
and amused them most was the hero of the hour
they did not discriminate very carefully between the eloquence of the forum and the eloquence of the hustings
human nature ruled in both alike
and he who was the most effective speaker in a political harangue was often retained as most likely to win in a cause to be tried or argued
and i have no doubt in this way many retainers came to lincoln
money in any form
had no charms for him in his eager pursuit of fame he could not afford to make money
he was ambitious to distinguish himself by some great service to mankind
and this ambition for fame and real public service left no room for avarice in his composition
however much he earned
he seems to have ended every year hardly richer than he began it
and yet
as the years passed
fees came to him freely
one of l 1
000 is recorded a very large professional fee at that time
even in any part of america
the paradise of lawyers
i lay great stress on lincoln's career as a lawyer much more than his biographers do because in america a state of things exists wholly different from that which prevails in great britain
the profession of the law always has been and is to this day the principal avenue to public life and i am sure that his training and experience in the courts had much to do with the development of those forces of intellect and character which he soon displayed on a broader arena
it was in political controversy
of course
that he acquired his wide reputation
and made his deep and lasting impression upon the people of what had now become the powerful state of illinois
and upon the people of the great west
to whom the political power and control of the united states were already surely and swiftly passing from the older eastern states
it was this reputation and this impression
and the familiar knowledge of his character which had come to them from his local leadership
that happily inspired the people of the west to present him as their candidate
and to press him upon the republican convention of 1860 as the fit and necessary leader in the struggle for life which was before the nation
that struggle
as you all know
arose out of the terrible question of slavery and i must trust to your general knowledge of the history of that question to make intelligible the attitude and leadership of lincoln as the champion of the hosts of freedom in the final contest
negro slavery had been firmly established in the southern states from an early period of their history
in 1619
the year before the mayflower landed our pilgrim fathers upon plymouth rock
a dutch ship had discharged a cargo of african slaves at jamestown in virginia
all through the colonial period their importation had continued
a few had found their way into the northern states
but none of them in sufficient numbers to constitute danger or to afford a basis for political power
at the time of the adoption of the federal constitution
there is no doubt that the principal members of the convention not only condemned slavery as a moral
and political evil
but believed that by the suppression of the slave trade it was in the course of gradual extinction in the south
as it certainly was in the north
in his will
provided for the emancipation of his own slaves
and said to jefferson that it was among his first wishes to see some plan adopted by which slavery in his country might be abolished
jefferson said
referring to the institution
i tremble for my country when i think that god is just that his justice cannot sleep forever
and franklin
and patrick henry were all utterly opposed to it
but it was made the subject of a fatal compromise in the federal constitution
whereby its existence was recognized in the states as a basis of representation
the prohibition of the importation of slaves was postponed for twenty years
and the return of fugitive slaves provided for
but no imminent danger was apprehended from it till
by the invention of the cotton gin in 1792
cotton culture by negro labor became at once and forever the leading industry of the south
and gave a new impetus to the importation of slaves
so that in 1808
when the constitutional prohibition took effect
their numbers had vastly increased
from that time forward slavery became the basis of a great political power
and the southern states
under all circumstances and at every opportunity
carried on a brave and unrelenting struggle for its maintenance and extension
the conscience of the north was slow to rise against it
though bitter controversies from time to time took place
the southern leaders threatened disunion if their demands were not complied with
to save the union
compromise after compromise was made
but each one in the end was broken
the missouri compromise
made in 1820 upon the occasion of the admission of missouri into the union as a slave state
in consideration of such admission
slavery was forever excluded from the northwest territory
was ruthlessly repealed in 1854
by a congress elected in the interests of the slave power
the intent being to force slavery into that vast territory which had so long been dedicated to freedom
this challenge at last aroused the slumbering conscience and passion of the north
and led to the formation of the republican party for the avowed purpose of preventing
by constitutional methods
the further extension of slavery
in its first campaign
in 1856
though it failed to elect its candidates it received a surprising vote and carried many of the states
no one could any longer doubt that the north had made up its mind that no threats of disunion should deter it from pressing its cherished purpose and performing its long neglected duty
from the outset
lincoln was one of the most active and effective leaders and speakers of the new party
and the great debates between lincoln and douglas in 1858
as the respective champions of the restriction and extension of slavery
attracted the attention of the whole country
lincoln's powerful arguments carried conviction everywhere
his moral nature was thoroughly aroused his conscience was stirred to the quick
unless slavery was wrong
nothing was wrong
was each man
of whatever color
entitled to the fruits of his own labor
or could one man live in idle luxury by the sweat of another's brow
whose skin was darker
he was an implicit believer in that principle of the declaration of independence that all men are vested with certain inalienable rights the equal rights to life
and the pursuit of happiness
on this doctrine he staked his case and carried it
we have time only for one or two sentences in which he struck the keynote of the contest
the real issue in this country is the eternal struggle between these two principles right and wrong throughout the world
they are the two principles that have stood face to face from the beginning of time
and will ever continue to struggle
the one is the common right of humanity
and the other the divine right of kings
it is the same principle in whatever shape it develops itself
it is the same spirit that says
you work and toil and earn bread and i'll eat it
 he foresaw with unerring vision that the conflict was inevitable and irrepressible that one or the other
the right or the wrong
freedom or slavery
must ultimately prevail and wholly prevail
throughout the country and this was the principle that carried the war
once begun
to a finish
one sentence of his is immortal
under the operation of the policy of compromise
the slavery agitation has not only not ceased
but has constantly augmented
in my opinion it will not cease until a crisis shall have been reached and passed
a house divided against itself cannot stand
 i believe this government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free
i do not expect the union to be dissolved
i do not expect the house to fall
but i do expect it will cease to be divided
it will become all one thing or all the other either the opponents of slavery will arrest the further spread of it
and place it where the public mind shall rest in the belief that it is in the course of ultimate extinction
or its advocates will push it forward till it shall become alike lawful in all the states
old as well as new
north as well as south
during the entire decade from 1850 to 1860 the agitation of the slavery question was at the boiling point
and events which have become historical continually indicated the near approach of the overwhelming storm
no sooner had the compromise acts of 1850 resulted in a temporary peace
which everybody said must be final and perpetual
than new outbreaks came
the forcible carrying away of fugitive slaves by federal troops from boston agitated that ancient stronghold of freedom to its foundations
the publication of uncle tom's cabin
which truly exposed the frightful possibilities of the slave system the reckless attempts by force and fraud to establish it in kansas against the will of the vast majority of the settlers the beating of summer in the senate chamber for words spoken in debate the dred scott decision in the supreme court
which made the nation realize that the slave power had at last reached the fountain of federal justice and finally the execution of john brown
for his wild raid into virginia
to invite the slaves to rally to the standard of freedom which he unfurled
all these events tend to illustrate and confirm lincoln's contention that the nation could not permanently continue half slave and half free
but must become all one thing or all the other
when john brown lay under sentence of death he declared that now he was sure that slavery must be wiped out in blood but neither he nor his executioners dreamt that within four years a million soldiers would be marching across the country for its final extirpation
to the music of the war song of the great conflict
john brown's body lies a mouldering in the grave
but his soul is marching on
and now
at the age of fifty one
this child of the wilderness
this farm laborer
this surveyor
and patriot
found himself elected by the great party which was pledged to prevent at all hazards the further extension of slavery
as the chief magistrate of the republic
bound to carry out that purpose
to be the leader and ruler of the nation in its most trying hour
those who believe that there is a living providence that overrules and conducts the affairs of nations
find in the elevation of this plain man to this extraordinary fortune and to this great duty
which he so fitly discharged
a signal vindication of their faith
perhaps to this philosophical institution the judgment of our philosopher emerson will commend itself as a just estimate of lincoln's historical place
his occupying the chair of state was a triumph of the good sense of mankind and of the public conscience
he grew according to the need his mind mastered the problem of the day
and as the problem grew
so did his comprehension of it
in the war there was no place for holiday magistrate
nor fair weather sailor
the new pilot was hurried to the helm in a tornado
in four years four years of battle days his endurance
his fertility of resource
his magnanimity
were sorely tried
and never found wanting
by his courage
his justice
his even temper
his fertile counsel
his humanity
he stood a heroic figure in the centre of a heroic epoch
he is the true history of the american people in his time
the true representative of this continent father of his country
the pulse of twenty millions throbbing in his heart
the thought of their mind articulated in his tongue
he was born great
as distinguished from those who achieve greatness or have it thrust upon them
and his inherent capacity
and physical
having been recognized by the educated intelligence of a free people
they happily chose him for their ruler in a day of deadly peril
it is now forty years since i first saw and heard abraham lincoln
but the impression which he left on my mind is ineffaceable
after his great successes in the west he came to new york to make a political address
he appeared in every sense of the word like one of the plain people among whom he loved to be counted
at first sight there was nothing impressive or imposing about him except that his great stature singled him out from the crowd
his clothes hung awkwardly on his giant frame his face was of a dark pallor
without the slightest tinge of color his seamed and rugged features bore the furrows of hardship and struggle his deep set eyes looked sad and anxious his countenance in repose gave little evidence of that brain power which had raised him from the lowest to the highest station among his countrymen as he talked to me before the meeting
he seemed ill at ease
with that sort of apprehension which a young man might feel before presenting himself to a new and strange audience
whose critical disposition he dreaded
it was a great audience
including all the noted men all the learned and cultured of his party in new york editors
they were all very curious to hear him
his fame as a powerful speaker had preceded him
and exaggerated rumor of his wit the worst forerunner of an orator had reached the east
when mr
bryant presented him
on the high platform of the cooper institute
a vast sea of eager upturned faces greeted him
full of intense curiosity to see what this rude child of the people was like
he was equal to the occasion
when he spoke he was transformed his eye kindled
his voice rang
his face shone and seemed to light up the whole assembly
for an hour and a half he held his audience in the hollow of his hand
his style of speech and manner of delivery were severely simple
what lowell called the grand simplicities of the bible
with which he was so familiar
were reflected in his discourse
with no attempt at ornament or rhetoric
without parade or pretence
he spoke straight to the point
if any came expecting the turgid eloquence or the ribaldry of the frontier
they must have been startled at the earnest and sincere purity of his utterances
it was marvellous to see how this untutored man
by mere self discipline and the chastening of his own spirit
had outgrown all meretricious arts
and found his own way to the grandeur and strength of absolute simplicity
he spoke upon the theme which he had mastered so thoroughly
he demonstrated by copious historical proofs and masterly logic that the fathers who created the constitution in order to form a more perfect union
to establish justice
and to secure the blessings of liberty to themselves and their posterity
intended to empower the federal government to exclude slavery from the territories
in the kindliest spirit he protested against the avowed threat of the southern states to destroy the union if
in order to secure freedom in those vast regions out of which future states were to be carved
a republican president were elected
he closed with an appeal to his audience
spoken with all the fire of his aroused and kindling conscience
with a full outpouring of his love of justice and liberty
to maintain their political purpose on that lofty and unassailable issue of right and wrong which alone could justify it
and not to be intimidated from their high resolve and sacred duty by any threats of destruction to the government or of ruin to themselves
he concluded with this telling sentence
which drove the whole argument home to all our hearts
let us have faith that right makes might
and in that faith let us to the end dare to do our duty as we understand it
that night the great hall
and the next day the whole city
rang with delighted applause and congratulations
and he who had come as a stranger departed with the laurels of great triumph
in five years from that exulting night i saw him again
for the last time
in the same city
borne in his coffin through its draped streets
with tears and lamentations a heart broken people accompanied him from washington
the scene of his martyrdom
to his last resting place in the young city of the west where he had worked his way to fame
never was a new ruler in a more desperate plight than lincoln when he entered office on the fourth of march
four months after his election
and took his oath to support the constitution and the union
the intervening time had been busily employed by the southern states in carrying out their threat of disunion in the event of his election
as soon as the fact was ascertained
seven of them had seceded and had seized upon the forts
navy yards
and other public property of the united states within their boundaries
and were making every preparation for war
in the meantime the retiring president
who had been elected by the slave power
and who thought the seceding states could not lawfully be coerced
had done absolutely nothing
lincoln found himself
by the constitution
commander in chief of the army and navy of the united states
but with only a remnant of either at hand
each was to be created on a great scale out of the unknown resources of a nation untried in war
in his mild and conciliatory inaugural address
while appealing to the seceding states to return to their allegiance
he avowed his purpose to keep the solemn oath he had taken that day
to see that the laws of the union were faithfully executed
and to use the troops to recover the forts
navy yards
and other property belonging to the government
it is probable
that neither side actually realized that war was inevitable
and that the other was determined to fight
until the assault on fort sumter presented the south as the first aggressor and roused the north to use every possible resource to maintain the government and the imperilled union
and to vindicate the supremacy of the flag over every inch of the territory of the united states
the fact that lincoln's first proclamation called for only 75
000 troops
to serve for three months
shows how inadequate was even his idea of what the future had in store
but from that moment lincoln and his loyal supporters never faltered in their purpose
they knew they could win
that it was their duty to win
and that for america the whole hope of the future depended upon their winning for now by the acts of the seceding states the issue of the election to secure or prevent the extension of slavery stood transformed into a struggle to preserve or to destroy the union
we cannot follow this contest
you know its gigantic proportions that it lasted four years instead of three months that in its progress
instead of 75
000 men
more than 2
000 were enrolled on the side of the government alone that the aggregate cost and loss to the nation approximated to 1
000 pounds sterling
and that not less than 300
000 brave and precious lives were sacrificed on each side
history has recorded how lincoln bore himself during these four frightful years that he was the real president
the responsible and actual head of the government
through it all that he listened to all advice
heard all parties
and then
always realizing his responsibility to god and the nation
decided every great executive question for himself
his absolute honesty had become proverbial long before he was president
honest abe lincoln was the name by which he had been known for years
his every act attested it
in all the grandeur of the vast power that he wielded
he never ceased to be one of the plain people
as he always called them
never lost or impaired his perfect sympathy with them
was always in perfect touch with them and open to their appeals and here lay the very secret of his personality and of his power
for the people in turn gave him their absolute confidence
his courage
his fortitude
his patience
his hopefulness
were sorely tried but never exhausted
he was true as steel to his generals
but had frequent occasion to change them
as he found them inadequate
this serious and painful duty rested wholly upon him
and was perhaps his most important function as commander in chief but when
at last
he recognized in general grant the master of the situation
the man who could and would bring the war to a triumphant end
he gave it all over to him and upheld him with all his might
amid all the pressure and distress that the burdens of office brought upon him
his unfailing sense of humor saved him probably it made it possible for him to live under the burden
he had always been the great story teller of the west
and he used and cultivated this faculty to relieve the weight of the load he bore
it enabled him to keep the wonderful record of never having lost his temper
no matter what agony he had to bear
a whole night might be spent in recounting the stories of his wit
and harmless sarcasm
but i will recall only two of his sayings
both about general grant
who always found plenty of enemies and critics to urge the president to oust him from his command
i am sure
will interest all scotchmen
they repeated with malicious intent the gossip that grant drank
what does he drink
asked lincoln
was
of course
the answer doubtless you can guess the brand
said the president
just find out what particular kind he uses and i'll send a barrel to each of my other generals
the other must be as pleasing to the british as to the american ear
when pressed again on other grounds to get rid of grant
he declared
i can't spare that man
he fights
he was tender hearted to a fault
and never could resist the appeals of wives and mothers of soldiers who had got into trouble and were under sentence of death for their offences
his secretary of war and other officials complained that they never could get deserters shot
as surely as the women of the culprit's family could get at him he always gave way
certainly you will all appreciate his exquisite sympathy with the suffering relatives of those who had fallen in battle
his heart bled with theirs
never was there a more gentle and tender utterance than his letter to a mother who had given all her sons to her country
written at a time when the angel of death had visited almost every household in the land
and was already hovering over him
i have been shown
he says
in the files of the war department a statement that you are the mother of five sons who have died gloriously on the field of battle
i feel how weak and fruitless must be any words of mine which should attempt to beguile you from your grief for a loss so overwhelming but i cannot refrain from tendering to you the consolation which may be found in the thanks of the republic they died to save
i pray that our heavenly father may assuage the anguish of your bereavement and leave you only the cherished memory of the loved and the lost
and the solemn pride that must be yours to have laid so costly a sacrifice upon the altar of freedom
hardly could your illustrious sovereign
from the depths of her queenly and womanly heart
have spoken words more touching and tender to soothe the stricken mothers of her own soldiers
the emancipation proclamation
with which mr
lincoln delighted the country and the world on the first of january
will doubtless secure for him a foremost place in history among the philanthropists and benefactors of the race
as it rescued
from hopeless and degrading slavery
so many millions of his fellow beings described in the law and existing in fact as chattels personal
in the hands of their owners and possessors
to all intents
and purposes whatsoever
rarely does the happy fortune come to one man to render such a service to his kind to proclaim liberty throughout the land unto all the inhabitants thereof
ideas rule the world
and never was there a more signal instance of this triumph of an idea than here
william lloyd garrison
who thirty years before had begun his crusade for the abolition of slavery
and had lived to see this glorious and unexpected consummation of the hopeless cause to which he had devoted his life
well described the proclamation as a great historic event
sublime in its magnitude
momentous and beneficent in its far reaching consequences
and eminently just and right alike to the oppressor and the oppressed
lincoln had always been heart and soul opposed to slavery
tradition says that on the trip on the flatboat to new orleans he formed his first and last opinion of slavery at the sight of negroes chained and scourged
and that then and there the iron entered into his soul
no boy could grow to manhood in those days as a poor white in kentucky and indiana
in close contact with slavery or in its neighborhood
without a growing consciousness of its blighting effects on free labor
as well as of its frightful injustice and cruelty
in the legislature of illinois
where the public sentiment was all for upholding the institution and violently against every movement for its abolition or restriction
upon the passage of resolutions to that effect he had the courage with one companion to put on record his protest
believing that the institution of slavery is founded both in injustice and bad policy
no great demonstration of courage
you will say but that was at a time when garrison
for his abolition utterances
had been dragged by an angry mob through the streets of boston with a rope around his body
and in the very year that lovejoy in the same state of illinois was slain by rioters while defending his press
from which he had printed antislavery appeals
in congress he brought in a bill for gradual abolition in the district of columbia
with compensation to the owners
for until they raised treasonable hands against the life of the nation he always maintained that the property of the slaveholders
into which they had come by two centuries of descent
without fault on their part
ought not to be taken away from them without just compensation
he used to say that
one way or another
he had voted forty two times for the wilmot proviso
which mr
wilmot of pennsylvania moved as an addition to every bill which affected united states territory
that neither slavery nor involuntary servitude shall ever exist in any part of the said territory
and it is evident that his condemnation of the system
on moral grounds as a crime against the human race
and on political grounds as a cancer that was sapping the vitals of the nation
and must master its whole being or be itself extirpated
grew steadily upon him until it culminated in his great speeches in the illinois debate
by the mere election of lincoln to the presidency
the further extension of slavery into the territories was rendered forever impossible vox populi
vox dei
revolutions never go backward
and when founded on a great moral sentiment stirring the heart of an indignant people their edicts are irresistible and final
had the slave power acquiesced in that election
had the southern states remained under the constitution and within the union
and relied upon their constitutional and legal rights
their favorite institution
immoral as it was
blighting and fatal as it was
might have endured for another century
the great party that had elected him
unalterably determined against its extension
was nevertheless pledged not to interfere with its continuance in the states where it already existed
of course
when new regions were forever closed against it
from its very nature it must have begun to shrink and to dwindle and probably gradual and compensated emancipation
which appealed very strongly to the new president's sense of justice and expediency
in the progress of time
by a reversion to the ideas of the founders of the republic
have found a safe outlet for both masters and slaves
but whom the gods wish to destroy they first make mad
and when seven states
afterwards increased to eleven
openly seceded from the union
when they declared and began the war upon the nation
and challenged its mighty power to the desperate and protracted struggle for its life
and for the maintenance of its authority as a nation over its territory
they gave to lincoln and to freedom the sublime opportunity of history
in his first inaugural address
when as yet not a drop of precious blood had been shed
while he held out to them the olive branch in one hand
in the other he presented the guarantees of the constitution
and after reciting the emphatic resolution of the convention that nominated him
that the maintenance inviolate of the rights of the states
and especially the right of each state to order and control its own domestic institutions according to its own judgment exclusively
is essential to that balance of power on which the perfection and endurance of our political fabric depend
he reiterated this sentiment
and declared
with no mental reservation
that all the protection which
consistently with the constitution and the laws
can be given
will be cheerfully given to all the states when lawfully demanded for whatever cause as cheerfully to one section as to another
when
these magnanimous overtures for peace and reunion were rejected when the seceding states defied the constitution and every clause and principle of it when they persisted in staying out of the union from which they had seceded
and proceeded to carve out of its territory a new and hostile empire based on slavery when they flew at the throat of the nation and plunged it into the bloodiest war of the nineteenth century the tables were turned
and the belief gradually came to the mind of the president that if the rebellion was not soon subdued by force of arms
if the war must be fought out to the bitter end
then to reach that end the salvation of the nation itself might require the destruction of slavery wherever it existed that if the war was to continue on one side for disunion
for no other purpose than to preserve slavery
it must continue on the other side for the union
to destroy slavery
as he said
events control me i cannot control events
and as the dreadful war progressed and became more deadly and dangerous
the unalterable conviction was forced upon him that
in order that the frightful sacrifice of life and treasure on both sides might not be all in vain
it had become his duty as commander in chief of the army
as a necessary war measure
to strike a blow at the rebellion which
all others failing
would inevitably lead to its annihilation
by annihilating the very thing for which it was contending
his own words are the best
i understood that my oath to preserve the constitution to the best of my ability imposed upon me the duty of preserving by every indispensable means that government that nation of which that constitution was the organic law
was it possible to lose the nation and yet preserve the constitution
by general law
life and limb must be protected
yet often a limb must be amputated to save a life but a life is never wisely given to save a limb
i felt that measures otherwise unconstitutional might become lawful by becoming indispensable to the preservation of the constitution through the preservation of the nation
right or wrong
i assumed this ground and now avow it
i could not feel that to the best of my ability i had ever tried to preserve the constitution if to save slavery or any minor matter i should permit the wreck of government
and constitution all together
and so
at last
when in his judgment the indispensable necessity had come
he struck the fatal blow
and signed the proclamation which has made his name immortal
by it
the president
as commander in chief in time of actual armed rebellion
and as a fit and necessary war measure for suppressing the rebellion
proclaimed all persons held as slaves in the states and parts of states then in rebellion to be thenceforward free
and declared that the executive
with the army and navy
would recognize and maintain their freedom
in the other great steps of the government
which led to the triumphant prosecution of the war
he necessarily shared the responsibility and the credit with the great statesmen who stayed up his hands in his cabinet
with seward
chase and stanton
and the rest
and with his generals and admirals
his soldiers and sailors
but this great act was absolutely his own
the conception and execution were exclusively his
he laid it before his cabinet as a measure on which his mind was made up and could not be changed
asking them only for suggestions as to details
he chose the time and the circumstances under which the emancipation should be proclaimed and when it should take effect
it came not an hour too soon but public opinion in the north would not have sustained it earlier
in the first eighteen months of the war its ravages had extended from the atlantic to beyond the mississippi
many victories in the west had been balanced and paralyzed by inaction and disasters in virginia
only partially redeemed by the bloody and indecisive battle of antietam a reaction had set in from the general enthusiasm which had swept the northern states after the assault upon sumter
it could not truly be said that they had lost heart
but faction was raising its head
heard through the land like the blast of a bugle
the proclamation rallied the patriotism of the country to fresh sacrifices and renewed ardor
it was a step that could not be revoked
it relieved the conscience of the nation from an incubus that had oppressed it from its birth
the united states were rescued from the false predicament in which they had been from the beginning
and the great popular heart leaped with new enthusiasm for liberty and union
henceforth and forever
one and inseparable
it brought not only moral but material support to the cause of the government
for within two years 120
000 colored troops were enlisted in the military service and following the national flag
supported by all the loyalty of the north
and led by its choicest spirits
one mother said
when her son was offered the command of the first colored regiment
if he accepts it i shall be as proud as if i had heard that he was shot
he was shot heading a gallant charge of his regiment
the confederates replied to a request of his friends for his body that they had buried him under a layer of his niggers
but that mother has lived to enjoy thirty six years of his glory
and boston has erected its noblest monument to his memory
the effect of the proclamation upon the actual progress of the war was not immediate
but wherever the federal armies advanced they carried freedom with them
and when the summer came round the new spirit and force which had animated the heart of the government and people were manifest
in the first week of july the decisive battle of gettysburg turned the tide of war
and the fall of vicksburg made the great river free from its source to the gulf
on foreign nations the influence of the proclamation and of these new victories was of great importance
in those days
when there was no cable
it was not easy for foreign observers to appreciate what was really going on they could not see clearly the true state of affairs
as in the last year of the nineteenth century we have been able
by our new electric vision
to watch every event at the antipodes and observe its effect
the rebel emissaries
sent over to solicit intervention
spared no pains to impress upon the minds of public and private men and upon the press their own views of the character of the contest
the prospects of the confederacy were always better abroad than at home
the stock markets of the world gambled upon its chances
and its bonds at one time were high in favor
such ideas as these were seriously held
that the north was fighting for empire and the south for independence that the southern states
instead of being the grossest oligarchies
essentially despotisms
founded on the right of one man to appropriate the fruit of other men's toil and to exclude them from equal rights
were real republics
feebler to be sure than their northern rivals
but representing the same idea of freedom
and that the mighty strength of the nation was being put forth to crush them that jefferson davis and the southern leaders had created a nation that the republican experiment had failed and the union had ceased to exist
but the crowning argument to foreign minds was that it was an utter impossibility for the government to win in the contest that the success of the southern states
so far as separation was concerned
was as certain as any event yet future and contingent could be that the subjugation of the south by the north
even if it could be accomplished
would prove a calamity to the united states and the world
and especially calamitous to the negro race and that such a victory would necessarily leave the people of the south for many generations cherishing deadly hostility against the government and the north
and plotting always to recover their independence
when lincoln issued his proclamation he knew that all these ideas were founded in error that the national resources were inexhaustible that the government could and would win
and that if slavery were once finally disposed of
the only cause of difference being out of the way
the north and south would come together again
and by and by be as good friends as ever
in many quarters abroad the proclamation was welcomed with enthusiasm by the friends of america but i think the demonstrations in its favor that brought more gladness to lincoln's heart than any other were the meetings held in the manufacturing centres
by the very operatives upon whom the war bore the hardest
expressing the most enthusiastic sympathy with the proclamation
while they bore with heroic fortitude the grievous privations which the war entailed upon them
lincoln's expectation when he announced to the world that all slaves in all states then in rebellion were set free must have been that the avowed position of his government
that the continuance of the war now meant the annihilation of slavery
would make intervention impossible for any foreign nation whose people were lovers of liberty and so the result proved
the growth and development of lincoln's mental power and moral force
of his intense and magnetic personality
after the vast responsibilities of government were thrown upon him at the age of fifty two
furnish a rare and striking illustration of the marvellous capacity and adaptability of the human intellect of the sound mind in the sound body
he came to the discharge of the great duties of the presidency with absolutely no experience in the administration of government
or of the vastly varied and complicated questions of foreign and domestic policy which immediately arose
and continued to press upon him during the rest of his life but he mastered each as it came
apparently with the facility of a trained and experienced ruler
as clarendon said of cromwell
his parts seemed to be raised by the demands of great station
his life through it all was one of intense labor
and distress
without one hour of peaceful repose from first to last
but he rose to every occasion
he led public opinion
but did not march so far in advance of it as to fail of its effective support in every great emergency
he knew the heart and thought of the people
as no man not in constant and absolute sympathy with them could have known it
and so holding their confidence
he triumphed through and with them
not only was there this steady growth of intellect
but the infinite delicacy of his nature and its capacity for refinement developed also
as exhibited in the purity and perfection of his language and style of speech
the rough backwoodsman
who had never seen the inside of a university
became in the end
by self training and the exercise of his own powers of mind
and soul
a master of style
and some of his utterances will rank with the best
the most perfectly adapted to the occasion which produced them
have you time to listen to his two minutes speech at gettysburg
at the dedication of the soldiers' cemetery
his whole soul was in it
four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation
conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal
now we are engaged in a great civil war
testing whether that nation
or any nation so conceived and so dedicated
can long endure
we are met on a great battlefield of that war
we have come to dedicate a portion of that field as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live
it is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this
but in a larger sense we cannot dedicate we cannot consecrate we cannot hallow this ground
the brave men
living and dead
who struggled here have consecrated it far above our poor power to add or detract
the world will little note
nor long remember
what we say here but it can never forget what they did here
it is for us
the living
to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced
it is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain that this nation under god shall have a new birth of freedom and that government of the people
by the people
and for the people shall not perish from the earth
he lived to see his work indorsed by an overwhelming majority of his countrymen
in his second inaugural address
pronounced just forty days before his death
there is a single passage which well displays his indomitable will and at the same time his deep religious feeling
his sublime charity to the enemies of his country
and his broad and catholic humanity
if we shall suppose that american slavery is one of those offences which in the providence of god must needs come
but which
having continued through the appointed time
he now wills to remove
and that he gives to both north and south this terrible war
as the woe due to those by whom the offence came
shall we discern therein any departure from those divine attributes which the believers in a living god always ascribe to him
fondly do we hope
fervently do we pray
that this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away
if god wills that it continue until all the wealth piled by the bondsmen's two hundred and fifty years of unrequited toil shall be sunk
and until every drop of blood drawn with the lash shall be paid with another drawn by the sword
as was said three thousand years ago
so still it must be said
the judgments of the lord are true and righteous altogether
 with malice toward none
with charity for all
with firmness in the right as god gives us to see the right let us strive on to finish the work we are in to bind up the nation's wounds to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan to do all which may achieve
and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves
and with all nations
his prayer was answered
the forty days of life that remained to him were crowned with great historic events
he lived to see his proclamation of emancipation embodied in an amendment of the constitution
adopted by congress
and submitted to the states for ratification
the mighty scourge of war did speedily pass away
for it was given him to witness the surrender of the rebel army and the fall of their capital
and the starry flag that he loved waving in triumph over the national soil
when he died by the madman's hand in the supreme hour of victory
the vanquished lost their best friend
and the human race one of its noblest examples and all the friends of freedom and justice
in whose cause he lived and died
joined hands as mourners at his grave
the writings of abraham lincoln
1832 1843 1832 address to the people of sangamon county
march 9
fellow citizens
having become a candidate for the honorable office of one of your representatives in the next general assembly of this state
in according with an established custom and the principles of true republicanism it becomes my duty to make known to you
the people whom i propose to represent
my sentiments with regard to local affairs
time and experience have verified to a demonstration the public utility of internal improvements
that the poorest and most thinly populated countries would be greatly benefited by the opening of good roads
and in the clearing of navigable streams within their limits
is what no person will deny
yet it is folly to undertake works of this or any other without first knowing that we are able to finish them as half finished work generally proves to be labor lost
there cannot justly be any objection to having railroads and canals
any more than to other good things
provided they cost nothing
the only objection is to paying for them and the objection arises from the want of ability to pay
with respect to the county of sangamon
however desirable an object the construction of a railroad through our country may be
however high our imaginations may be heated at thoughts of it
there is always a heart appalling shock accompanying the amount of its cost
which forces us to shrink from our pleasing anticipations
the probable cost of this contemplated railroad is estimated at 290
000 the bare statement of which
in my opinion
is sufficient to justify the belief that the improvement of the sangamon river is an object much better suited to our infant resources
what the cost of this work would be
i am unable to say
it is probable
that it would not be greater than is common to streams of the same length
i believe the improvement of the sangamon river to be vastly important and highly desirable to the people of the county and
if elected
any measure in the legislature having this for its object
which may appear judicious
will meet my approbation and receive my support
it appears that the practice of loaning money at exorbitant rates of interest has already been opened as a field for discussion so i suppose i may enter upon it without claiming the honor or risking the danger which may await its first explorer
it seems as though we are never to have an end to this baneful and corroding system
acting almost as prejudicially to the general interests of the community as a direct tax of several thousand dollars annually laid on each county for the benefit of a few individuals only
unless there be a law made fixing the limits of usury
a law for this purpose
i am of opinion
may be made without materially injuring any class of people
in cases of extreme necessity
there could always be means found to cheat the law while in all other cases it would have its intended effect
i would favor the passage of a law on this subject which might not be very easily evaded
let it be such that the labor and difficulty of evading it could only be justified in cases of greatest necessity
upon the subject of education
not presuming to dictate any plan or system respecting it
i can only say that i view it as the most important subject which we as a people can be engaged in
that every man may receive at least a moderate education
and thereby be enabled to read the histories of his own and other countries
by which he may duly appreciate the value of our free institutions
appears to be an object of vital importance
even on this account alone
to say nothing of the advantages and satisfaction to be derived from all being able to read the scriptures
and other works both of a religious and moral nature
for themselves
for my part
i desire to see the time when education and by its means
and industry shall become much more general than at present
and should be gratified to have it in my power to contribute something to the advancement of any measure which might have a tendency to accelerate that happy period
with regard to existing laws
some alterations are thought to be necessary
many respectable men have suggested that our estray laws
the law respecting the issuing of executions
the road law
and some others
are deficient in their present form
and require alterations
considering the great probability that the framers of those laws were wiser than myself
i should prefer not meddling with them
unless they were first attacked by others in which case i should feel it both a privilege and a duty to take that stand which
in my view
might tend most to the advancement of justice
i shall conclude
considering the great degree of modesty which should always attend youth
it is probable i have already been more presuming than becomes me
upon the subjects of which i have treated
i have spoken as i have thought
i may be wrong in regard to any or all of them but
holding it a sound maxim that it is better only sometimes to be right than at all times to be wrong
so soon as i discover my opinions to be erroneous
i shall be ready to renounce them
every man is said to have his peculiar ambition
whether it be true or not
i can say
for one
that i have no other so great as that of being truly esteemed of my fellow men
by rendering myself worthy of their esteem
how far i shall succeed in gratifying this ambition is yet to be developed
i am young
and unknown to many of you
i was born
and have ever remained
in the most humble walks of life
i have no wealthy or popular relations or friends to recommend me
my case is thrown exclusively upon the independent voters of the county and
if elected
they will have conferred a favor upon me for which i shall be unremitting in my labors to compensate
if the good people in their wisdom shall see fit to keep me in the background
i have been too familiar with disappointments to be very much chagrined

dear sir
in regard to the time david rankin served the enclosed discharge shows correctly as well as i can recollect having no writing to refer
the transfer of rankin from my company occurred as follows
rankin having lost his horse at dixon's ferry and having acquaintance in one of the foot companies who were going down the river was desirous to go with them
and one galishen being an acquaintance of mine and belonging to the company in which rankin wished to go wished to leave it and join mine
this being the case it was agreed that they should exchange places and answer to each other's names as it was expected we all would be discharged in very few days
as to a blanket i have no knowledge of rankin ever getting any
the above embraces all the facts now in my recollection which are pertinent to the case
i shall take pleasure in giving any further information in my power should you call on me
your friend
response to request for postage receipt to mr
at your request i send you a receipt for the postage on your paper
i am somewhat surprised at your request
i will
comply with it
the law requires newspaper postage to be paid in advance
and now that i have waited a full year you choose to wound my feelings by insinuating that unless you get a receipt i will probably make you pay it again
1836 announcement of political views
new salem
june 13
to the editor of the journal in your paper of last saturday i see a communication
over the signature of many voters
in which the candidates who are announced in the journal are called upon to show their hands
agreed
here's mine
i go for all sharing the privileges of the government who assist in bearing its burdens
i go for admitting all whites to the right of suffrage who pay taxes or bear arms by no means excluding females
if elected
i shall consider the whole people of sangamon my constituents
as well those that oppose as those that support me
while acting as their representative
i shall be governed by their will on all subjects upon which i have the means of knowing what their will is and upon all others i shall do what my own judgment teaches me will best advance their interests
whether elected or not
i go for distributing the proceeds of the sales of the public lands to the several states
to enable our state
in common with others
to dig canals and construct railroads without borrowing money and paying the interest on it
if alive on the first monday in november
i shall vote for hugh l
white for president
very respectfully
response to political smear to robert allen new salem
june 21
1836 dear colonel
i am told that during my absence last week you passed through this place
and stated publicly that you were in possession of a fact or facts which
if known to the public
would entirely destroy the prospects of n
edwards and myself at the ensuing election but that
through favor to us
you should forbear to divulge them
no one has needed favors more than i
few have been less unwilling to accept them but in this case favor to me would be injustice to the public
and therefore i must beg your pardon for declining it
that i once had the confidence of the people of sangamon
is sufficiently evident and if i have since done anything
either by design or misadventure
which if known would subject me to a forfeiture of that confidence
he that knows of that thing
and conceals it
is a traitor to his country's interest
i find myself wholly unable to form any conjecture of what fact or facts
real or supposed
you spoke but my opinion of your veracity will not permit me for a moment to doubt that you at least believed what you said
i am flattered with the personal regard you manifested for me but i do hope that
on more mature reflection
you will view the public interest as a paramount consideration
and therefore determine to let the worst come
i here assure you that the candid statement of facts on your part
however low it may sink me
shall never break the tie of personal friendship between us
i wish an answer to this
and you are at liberty to publish both
if you choose
very respectfully
to miss mary owens
december 13
i have been sick ever since my arrival
or i should have written sooner
it is but little difference
as i have very little even yet to write
and more
the longer i can avoid the mortification of looking in the post office for your letter and not finding it
the better
you see i am mad about that old letter yet
i don't like very well to risk you again
i'll try you once more
the new state house is not yet finished
and consequently the legislature is doing little or nothing
the governor delivered an inflammatory political message
and it is expected there will be some sparring between the parties about it as soon as the two houses get to business
taylor delivered up his petition for the new county to one of our members this morning
i am told he despairs of its success
on account of all the members from morgan county opposing it
there are names enough on the petition
i think
to justify the members from our county in going for it but if the members from morgan oppose it
which they say they will
the chance will be bad
our chance to take the seat of government to springfield is better than i expected
an internal improvement convention was held there since we met
which recommended a loan of several millions of dollars
on the faith of the state
to construct railroads
some of the legislature are for it
and some against it which has the majority i cannot tell
there is great strife and struggling for the office of the united states senator here at this time
it is probable we shall ease their pains in a few days
the opposition men have no candidate of their own
and consequently they will smile as complacently at the angry snarl of the contending van buren candidates and their respective friends as the christian does at satan's rage
you recollect that i mentioned at the outset of this letter that i had been unwell
that is the fact
though i believe i am about well now but that
with other things i cannot account for
have conspired
and have gotten my spirits so low that i feel that i would rather be any place in the world than here
i really cannot endure the thought of staying here ten weeks
write back as soon as you get this
if possible
say something that will please me
for really i have not been pleased since i left you
this letter is so dry and stupid that i am ashamed to send it
but with my present feelings i cannot do any better
give my best respects to mr
and mrs
able and family
your friend
lincoln 1837 speech in illinois legislature
january
1837 mr
lest i should fall into the too common error of being mistaken in regard to which side i design to be upon
i shall make it my first care to remove all doubt on that point
by declaring that i am opposed to the resolution under consideration
in toto
before i proceed to the body of the subject
i will further remark
that it is not without a considerable degree of apprehension that i venture to cross the track of the gentleman from coles mr
i do not believe i could muster a sufficiency of courage to come in contact with that gentleman
were it not for the fact that he
some days since
most graciously condescended to assure us that he would never be found wasting ammunition on small game
on the same fortunate occasion
he further gave us to understand
that he regarded himself as being decidedly the superior of our common friend from randolph mr
shields and feeling
as i really do
that i
to say the most of myself
am nothing more than the peer of our friend from randolph
i shall regard the gentleman from coles as decidedly my superior also
and consequently
in the course of what i shall have to say
whenever i shall have occasion to allude to that gentleman
i shall endeavor to adopt that kind of court language which i understand to be due to decided superiority
in one faculty
at least
there can be no dispute of the gentleman's superiority over me and most other men
and that is
the faculty of entangling a subject
so that neither himself
or any other man
can find head or tail to it
here he has introduced a resolution embracing ninety nine printed lines across common writing paper
and yet more than one half of his opening speech has been made upon subjects about which there is not one word said in his resolution
though his resolution embraces nothing in regard to the constitutionality of the bank
much of what he has said has been with a view to make the impression that it was unconstitutional in its inception
although i am satisfied that an ample field may be found within the pale of the resolution
at least for small game
as the gentleman has traveled out of it
i feel that i may
with all due humility
venture to follow him
the gentleman has discovered that some gentleman at washington city has been upon the very eve of deciding our bank unconstitutional
and that he would probably have completed his very authentic decision
had not some one of the bank officers placed his hand upon his mouth
and begged him to withhold it
the fact that the individuals composing our supreme court have
in an official capacity
decided in favor of the constitutionality of the bank
in my mind
seem a sufficient answer to this
it is a fact known to all
that the members of the supreme court
together with the governor
form a council of revision
and that this council approved this bank charter
i ask
if the extra judicial decision not quite but almost made by the gentleman at washington
before whom
by the way
the question of the constitutionality of our bank never has
nor never can come is to be taken as paramount to a decision officially made by that tribunal
by which
and which alone
the constitutionality of the bank can ever be settled
aside from this view of the subject
i would ask
if the committee which this resolution proposes to appoint are to examine into the constitutionality of the bank
are they to be clothed with power to send for persons and papers
for this object
and after they have found the bank to be unconstitutional
and decided it so
how are they to enforce their decision
what will their decision amount to
they cannot compel the bank to cease operations
or to change the course of its operations
what good
can their labors result in
certainly none
the gentleman asks
if we
without an examination
by giving the state deposits to the bank
and by taking the stock reserved for the state
legalize its former misconduct
now i do not pretend to possess sufficient legal knowledge to decide whether a legislative enactment proposing to
and accepting from
the bank
certain terms
would have the effect to legalize or wipe out its former errors
or not but i can assure the gentleman
if such should be the effect
he has already got behind the settlement of accounts for it is well known to all
that the legislature
at its last session
passed a supplemental bank charter
which the bank has since accepted
and which
according to his doctrine
has legalized all the alleged violations of its original charter in the distribution of its stock
i now proceed to the resolution
by examination it will be found that the first thirty three lines
being precisely one third of the whole
relate exclusively to the distribution of the stock by the commissioners appointed by the state
it is clear that no question can arise on this portion of the resolution
except a question between capitalists in regard to the ownership of stock
some gentlemen have their stock in their hands
while others
who have more money than they know what to do with
want it and this
and this alone
is the question
to settle which we are called on to squander thousands of the people's money
what interest
let me ask
have the people in the settlement of this question
what difference is it to them whether the stock is owned by judge smith or sam wiggins
if any gentleman be entitled to stock in the bank
which he is kept out of possession of by others
let him assert his right in the supreme court
and let him or his antagonist
whichever may be found in the wrong
pay the costs of suit
it is an old maxim
and a very sound one
that he that dances should always pay the fiddler
in the present case
if any gentlemen
whose money is a burden to them
choose to lead off a dance
i am decidedly opposed to the people's money being used to pay the fiddler
no one can doubt that the examination proposed by this resolution must cost the state some ten or twelve thousand dollars and all this to settle a question in which the people have no interest
and about which they care nothing
these capitalists generally act harmoniously and in concert
to fleece the people
and now that they have got into a quarrel with themselves we are called upon to appropriate the people's money to settle the quarrel
i leave this part of the resolution and proceed to the remainder
it will be found that no charge in the remaining part of the resolution
if true
amounts to the violation of the bank charter
except one
which i will notice in due time
it might seem quite sufficient to say no more upon any of these charges or insinuations than enough to show they are not violations of the charter yet
as they are ingeniously framed and handled
with a view to deceive and mislead
i will notice in their order all the most prominent of them
the first of these is in relation to a connection between our bank and several banking institutions in other states
admitting this connection to exist
i should like to see the gentleman from coles
or any other gentleman
undertake to show that there is any harm in it
what can there be in such a connection
that the people of illinois are willing to pay their money to get a peep into
by a reference to the tenth section of the bank charter
any gentleman can see that the framers of the act contemplated the holding of stock in the institutions of other corporations
is it
when neither law nor justice forbids it
that we are asked to spend our time and money in inquiring into its truth
the next charge
in the order of time
that some officer
clerk or servant of the bank
has been required to take an oath of secrecy in relation to the affairs of said bank
i do not know whether this be true or false neither do i believe any honest man cares
i know that the seventh section of the charter expressly guarantees to the bank the right of making
under certain restrictions
such by laws as it may think fit and i further know that the requiring an oath of secrecy would not transcend those restrictions
if the bank has chosen to exercise this right
whom can it injure
does not every merchant have his secret mark
and who is ever silly enough to complain of it
i presume if the bank does require any such oath of secrecy
it is done through a motive of delicacy to those individuals who deal with it
not many days since
one gentleman upon this floor
by the way
i have no doubt is now ready to join this hue and cry against the bank
indulged in a philippic against one of the bank officials
as he said
he had divulged a secret
immediately following this last charge
there are several insinuations in the resolution
which are too silly to require any sort of notice
were it not for the fact that they conclude by saying
to the great injury of the people at large
in answer to this i would say that it is strange enough
that the people are suffering these great injuries
and yet are not sensible of it
singular indeed that the people should be writhing under oppression and injury
and yet not one among them to be found to raise the voice of complaint
if the bank be inflicting injury upon the people
why is it that not a single petition is presented to this body on the subject
if the bank really be a grievance
why is it that no one of the real people is found to ask redress of it
the truth is
no such oppression exists
if it did
our people would groan with memorials and petitions
and we would not be permitted to rest day or night
till we had put it down
the people know their rights
and they are never slow to assert and maintain them
when they are invaded
let them call for an investigation
and i shall ever stand ready to respond to the call
but they have made no such call
i make the assertion boldly
and without fear of contradiction
that no man
who does not hold an office
or does not aspire to one
has ever found any fault of the bank
it has doubled the prices of the products of their farms
and filled their pockets with a sound circulating medium
and they are all well pleased with its operations
it is the politician who is the first to sound the alarm which
by the way
is a false one
it is he
by these unholy means
is endeavoring to blow up a storm that he may ride upon and direct
it is he
and he alone
that here proposes to spend thousands of the people's public treasure
for no other advantage to them than to make valueless in their pockets the reward of their industry
this work is exclusively the work of politicians a set of men who have interests aside from the interests of the people
and who
to say the most of them
taken as a mass
at least one long step removed from honest men
i say this with the greater freedom
being a politician myself
none can regard it as personal
it is charged
or rather insinuated
that officers of the bank have loaned money at usurious rates of interest
suppose this to be true
are we to send a committee of this house to inquire into it
suppose the committee should find it true
can they redress the injured individuals
assuredly not
if any individual had been injured in this way
is there not an ample remedy to be found in the laws of the land
does the gentleman from coles know that there is a statute standing in full force making it highly penal for an individual to loan money at a higher rate of interest than twelve per cent
if he does not he is too ignorant to be placed at the head of the committee which his resolution purposes and if he does
his neglect to mention it shows him to be too uncandid to merit the respect or confidence of any one
but besides all this
if the bank were struck from existence
could not the owners of the capital still loan it usuriously
as well as now
whatever the bank
or its officers
may have done
i know that usurious transactions were much more frequent and enormous before the commencement of its operations than they have ever been since
the next insinuation is
that the bank has refused specie payments
if true is a violation of the charter
but there is not the least probability of its truth because
if such had been the fact
the individual to whom payment was refused would have had an interest in making it public
by suing for the damages to which the charter entitles him
yet no such thing has been done and the strong presumption is
that the insinuation is false and groundless
from this to the end of the resolution
there is nothing that merits attention i therefore drop the particular examination of it
by a general view of the resolution
it will be seen that a principal object of the committee is to examine into
and ferret out
a mass of corruption supposed to have been committed by the commissioners who apportioned the stock of the bank
i believe it is universally understood and acknowledged that all men will ever act correctly unless they have a motive to do otherwise
if this be true
we can only suppose that the commissioners acted corruptly by also supposing that they were bribed to do so
taking this view of the subject
i would ask if the bank is likely to find it more difficult to bribe the committee of seven
we are about to appoint
than it may have found it to bribe the commissioners
here mr
linder called to order
the chair decided that mr
lincoln was not out of order
linder appealed to the house
before the question was put
withdrew his appeal
saying he preferred to let the gentleman go on he thought he would break his own neck
lincoln proceeded
another gracious condescension
i acknowledge it with gratitude
i know i was not out of order and i know every sensible man in the house knows it
i was not saying that the gentleman from coles could be bribed
on the other hand
will i say he could not
in that particular i leave him where i found him
i was only endeavoring to show that there was at least as great a probability of any seven members that could be selected from this house being bribed to act corruptly
as there was that the twenty four commissioners had been so bribed
by a reference to the ninth section of the bank charter
it will be seen that those commissioners were john tilson
robert k
daniel warm
john c
edward m
edward l
robert r
ezra baker
aquilla wren
john taylor
samuel c
edmund roberts
benjamin godfrey
thomas mather
charles prentice
richard i
and edmund d
these are twenty four of the most respectable men in the state
probably no twenty four men could be selected in the state with whom the people are better acquainted
or in whose honor and integrity they would more readily place confidence
and i now repeat
that there is less probability that those men have been bribed and corrupted
than that any seven men
or rather any six men
that could be selected from the members of this house
might be so bribed and corrupted
even though they were headed and led on by decided superiority himself
in all seriousness
i ask every reasonable man
if an issue be joined by these twenty four commissioners
on the one part
and any other seven men
on the other part
and the whole depend upon the honor and integrity of the contending parties
to which party would the greatest degree of credit be due
another consideration is
that we have no right to make the examination
what i shall say upon this head i design exclusively for the law loving and law abiding part of the house
to those who claim omnipotence for the legislature
and who in the plenitude of their assumed powers are disposed to disregard the constitution
good faith
moral right
and everything else
i have not a word to say
but to the law abiding part i say
examine the bank charter
go examine the constitution
go examine the acts that the general assembly of this state has passed
and you will find just as much authority given in each and every of them to compel the bank to bring its coffers to this hall and to pour their contents upon this floor
as to compel it to submit to this examination which this resolution proposes
the gentleman from coles
the mover of this resolution
very lately denied on this floor that the legislature had any right to repeal or otherwise meddle with its own acts
when those acts were made in the nature of contracts
and had been accepted and acted on by other parties
now i ask if this resolution does not propose
for this house alone
to do what he
but the other day
denied the right of the whole legislature to do
he must either abandon the position he then took
or he must now vote against his own resolution
it is no difference to me
and i presume but little to any one else
which he does
i am by no means the special advocate of the bank
i have long thought that it would be well for it to report its condition to the general assembly
and that cases might occur
when it might be proper to make an examination of its affairs by a committee
during the last session
while a bill supplemental to the bank charter was pending before the house
i offered an amendment to the same
in these words
the said corporation shall
at the next session of the general assembly
and at each subsequent general session
during the existence of its charter
report to the same the amount of debts due from said corporation the amount of debts due to the same the amount of specie in its vaults
and an account of all lands then owned by the same
and the amount for which such lands have been taken and moreover
if said corporation shall at any time neglect or refuse to submit its books
and all and everything necessary for a full and fair examination of its affairs
to any person or persons appointed by the general assembly
for the purpose of making such examination
the said corporation shall forfeit its charter
this amendment was negatived by a vote of 34 to 15
eleven of the 34 who voted against it are now members of this house and though it would be out of order to call their names
i hope they will all recollect themselves
and not vote for this examination to be made without authority
inasmuch as they refused to receive the authority when it was in their power to do so
i have said that cases might occur
when an examination might be proper but i do not believe any such case has now occurred and if it has
i should still be opposed to making an examination without legal authority
i am opposed to encouraging that lawless and mobocratic spirit
whether in relation to the bank or anything else
which is already abroad in the land and is spreading with rapid and fearful impetuosity
to the ultimate overthrow of every institution
of every moral principle
in which persons and property have hitherto found security
but supposing we had the authority
i would ask what good can result from the examination
can we declare the bank unconstitutional
and compel it to desist from the abuses of its power
provided we find such abuses to exist
can we repair the injuries which it may have done to individuals
most certainly we can do none of these things
why then shall we spend the public money in such employment
say the examiners
we can injure the credit of the bank
if nothing else
please tell me
who will suffer most by that
you cannot injure
to any extent
the stockholders
they are men of wealth of large capital and consequently
beyond the power of malice
but by injuring the credit of the bank
you will depreciate the value of its paper in the hands of the honest and unsuspecting farmer and mechanic
and that is all you can do
but suppose you could effect your whole purpose suppose you could wipe the bank from existence
which is the grand ultimatum of the project
what would be the consequence
we should spend several thousand dollars of the public treasure in the operation
annihilate the currency of the state
render valueless in the hands of our people that reward of their former labors
and finally be once more under the comfortable obligation of paying the wiggins loan
principal and interest
opposition to mob rule address before the young men's lyceum of springfield
january 27
as a subject for the remarks of the evening
the perpetuation of our political institutions is selected
in the great journal of things happening under the sun
the american people
find our account running under date of the nineteenth century of the christian era
we find ourselves in the peaceful possession of the fairest portion of the earth as regards extent of territory
fertility of soil
and salubrity of climate
we find ourselves under the government of a system of political institutions conducing more essentially to the ends of civil and religious liberty than any of which the history of former times tells us
when mounting the stage of existence
found ourselves the legal inheritors of these fundamental blessings
we toiled not in the acquirement or establishment of them they are a legacy bequeathed us by a once hardy
and patriotic
but now lamented and departed
race of ancestors
theirs was the task and nobly they performed it to possess themselves
and through themselves us
of this goodly land
and to uprear upon its hills and its valleys a political edifice of liberty and equal rights it is ours only to transmit these the former unprofaned by the foot of an invader
the latter undecayed by the lapse of time and untorn by usurpation to the latest generation that fate shall permit the world to know
this task gratitude to our fathers
justice to ourselves
duty to posterity
and love for our species in general
all imperatively require us faithfully to perform
how then shall we perform it
at what point shall we expect the approach of danger
by what means shall we fortify against it
shall we expect some transatlantic military giant to step the ocean and crush us at a blow
all the armies of europe
and africa combined
with all the treasure of the earth our own excepted in their military chest
with a bonaparte for a commander
could not by force take a drink from the ohio or make a track on the blue ridge in a trial of a thousand years
at what point then is the approach of danger to be expected
i answer
if it ever reach us it must spring up amongst us it cannot come from abroad
if destruction be our lot we must ourselves be its author and finisher
as a nation of freemen we must live through all time
or die by suicide
i hope i am over wary but if i am not
there is even now something of ill omen amongst us
i mean the increasing disregard for law which pervades the country the growing disposition to substitute the wild and furious passions in lieu of the sober judgment of courts
and the worse than savage mobs for the executive ministers of justice
this disposition is awfully fearful in any community and that it now exists in ours
though grating to our feelings to admit
it would be a violation of truth and an insult to our intelligence to deny
accounts of outrages committed by mobs form the everyday news of the times
they have pervaded the country from new england to louisiana they are neither peculiar to the eternal snows of the former nor the burning suns of the latter they are not the creature of climate
neither are they confined to the slave holding or the non slave holding states
alike they spring up among the pleasure hunting masters of southern slaves
and the order loving citizens of the land of steady habits
whatever then their cause may be
it is common to the whole country
it would be tedious as well as useless to recount the horrors of all of them
those happening in the state of mississippi and at st
louis are perhaps the most dangerous in example and revolting to humanity
in the mississippi case they first commenced by hanging the regular gamblers a set of men certainly not following for a livelihood a very useful or very honest occupation
but one which
so far from being forbidden by the laws
was actually licensed by an act of the legislature passed but a single year before
negroes suspected of conspiring to raise an insurrection were caught up and hanged in all parts of the state then
white men supposed to be leagued with the negroes and finally
strangers from neighboring states
going thither on business
were in many instances subjected to the same fate
thus went on this process of hanging
from gamblers to negroes
from negroes to white citizens
and from these to strangers
till dead men were seen literally dangling from the boughs of trees upon every roadside
and in numbers almost sufficient to rival the native spanish moss of the country as a drapery of the forest
turn then to that horror striking scene at st
a single victim only was sacrificed there
this story is very short
and is perhaps the most highly tragic of anything of its length that has ever been witnessed in real life
a mulatto man by the name of mcintosh was seized in the street
dragged to the suburbs of the city
chained to a tree
and actually burned to death and all within a single hour from the time he had been a freeman attending to his own business and at peace with the world
such are the effects of mob law
and such are the scenes becoming more and more frequent in this land so lately famed for love of law and order
and the stories of which have even now grown too familiar to attract anything more than an idle remark
but you are perhaps ready to ask
what has this to do with the perpetuation of our political institutions
i answer
it has much to do with it
its direct consequences are
comparatively speaking
but a small evil
and much of its danger consists in the proneness of our minds to regard its direct as its only consequences
abstractly considered
the hanging of the gamblers at vicksburg was of but little consequence
they constitute a portion of population that is worse than useless in any community and their death
if no pernicious example be set by it
is never matter of reasonable regret with any one
if they were annually swept from the stage of existence by the plague or smallpox
honest men would perhaps be much profited by the operation
similar too is the correct reasoning in regard to the burning of the negro at st
he had forfeited his life by the perpetration of an outrageous murder upon one of the most worthy and respectable citizens of the city
and had he not died as he did
he must have died by the sentence of the law in a very short time afterwards
as to him alone
it was as well the way it was as it could otherwise have been
but the example in either case was fearful
when men take it in their heads to day to hang gamblers or burn murderers
they should recollect that in the confusion usually attending such transactions they will be as likely to hang or burn some one who is neither a gambler nor a murderer as one who is
and that
acting upon the example they set
the mob of to morrow may
and probably will
hang or burn some of them by the very same mistake
and not only so
the innocent
those who have ever set their faces against violations of law in every shape
alike with the guilty fall victims to the ravages of mob law and thus it goes on
step by step
till all the walls erected for the defense of the persons and property of individuals are trodden down and disregarded
but all this
is not the full extent of the evil
by such examples
by instances of the perpetrators of such acts going unpunished
the lawless in spirit are encouraged to become lawless in practice and having been used to no restraint but dread of punishment
they thus become absolutely unrestrained
having ever regarded government as their deadliest bane
they make a jubilee of the suspension of its operations
and pray for nothing so much as its total annihilation
on the other hand
good men
men who love tranquillity
who desire to abide by the laws and enjoy their benefits
who would gladly spill their blood in the defense of their country
seeing their property destroyed
their families insulted
and their lives endangered
their persons injured
and seeing nothing in prospect that forebodes a change for the better
become tired of and disgusted with a government that offers them no protection
and are not much averse to a change in which they imagine they have nothing to lose
by the operation of this mobocratic spirit which all must admit is now abroad in the land
the strongest bulwark of any government
and particularly of those constituted like ours
may effectually be broken down and destroyed i mean the attachment of the people
whenever this effect shall be produced among us whenever the vicious portion of population shall be permitted to gather in bands of hundreds and thousands
and burn churches
ravage and rob provision stores
throw printing presses into rivers
shoot editors
and hang and burn obnoxious persons at pleasure and with impunity
depend on it
this government cannot last
by such things the feelings of the best citizens will become more or less alienated from it
and thus it will be left without friends
or with too few
and those few too weak to make their friendship effectual
at such a time
and under such circumstances
men of sufficient talent and ambition will not be wanting to seize the opportunity
strike the blow
and overturn that fair fabric which for the last half century has been the fondest hope of the lovers of freedom throughout the world
i know the american people are much attached to their government i know they would suffer much for its sake i know they would endure evils long and patiently before they would ever think of exchanging it for another
notwithstanding all this
if the laws be continually despised and disregarded
if their rights to be secure in their persons and property are held by no better tenure than the caprice of a mob
the alienation of their affections from the government is the natural consequence and to that
sooner or later
it must come
is one point at which danger may be expected
the question recurs
how shall we fortify against it
the answer is simple
let every american
every lover of liberty
every well wisher to his posterity swear by the blood of the revolution never to violate in the least particular the laws of the country
and never to tolerate their violation by others
as the patriots of seventy six did to the support of the declaration of independence
so to the support of the constitution and laws let every american pledge his life
his property
and his sacred honor
let every man remember that to violate the law is to trample on the blood of his father
and to tear the charter of his own and his children's liberty
let reverence for the laws be breathed by every american mother to the lisping babe that prattles on her lap let it be taught in schools
in seminaries
and in colleges let it be written in primers
spelling books
and in almanacs let it be preached from the pulpit
proclaimed in legislative halls
and enforced in courts of justice
in short
let it become the political religion of the nation and let the old and the young
the rich and the poor
the grave and the gay of all sexes and tongues and colors and conditions
sacrifice unceasingly upon its altars
while ever a state of feeling such as this shall universally or even very generally prevail throughout the nation
vain will be every effort
and fruitless every attempt
to subvert our national freedom
i so pressingly urge a strict observance of all the laws
let me not be understood as saying there are no bad laws
or that grievances may not arise for the redress of which no legal provisions have been made
i mean to say no such thing
but i do mean to say that although bad laws
if they exist
should be repealed as soon as possible
while they continue in force
for the sake of example they should be religiously observed
so also in unprovided cases
if such arise
let proper legal provisions be made for them with the least possible delay
but till then let them
if not too intolerable
be borne with
there is no grievance that is a fit object of redress by mob law
in any case that may arise
for instance
the promulgation of abolitionism
one of two positions is necessarily true that is
the thing is right within itself
and therefore deserves the protection of all law and all good citizens
or it is wrong
and therefore proper to be prohibited by legal enactments and in neither case is the interposition of mob law either necessary
or excusable
but it may be asked
why suppose danger to our political institutions
have we not preserved them for more than fifty years
and why may we not for fifty times as long
we hope there is no sufficient reason
we hope all danger may be overcome but to conclude that no danger may ever arise would itself be extremely dangerous
there are now
and will hereafter be
many causes
dangerous in their tendency
which have not existed heretofore
and which are not too insignificant to merit attention
that our government should have been maintained in its original form
from its establishment until now
is not much to be wondered at
it had many props to support it through that period
which now are decayed and crumbled away
through that period it was felt by all to be an undecided experiment now it is understood to be a successful one
all that sought celebrity and fame and distinction expected to find them in the success of that experiment
their all was staked upon it their destiny was inseparably linked with it
their ambition aspired to display before an admiring world a practical demonstration of the truth of a proposition which had hitherto been considered at best no better than problematical namely
the capability of a people to govern themselves
if they succeeded they were to be immortalized their names were to be transferred to counties
and cities
and rivers
and mountains and to be revered and sung
toasted through all time
if they failed
they were to be called knaves and fools
and fanatics for a fleeting hour then to sink and be forgotten
they succeeded
the experiment is successful
and thousands have won their deathless names in making it so
but the game is caught and i believe it is true that with the catching end the pleasures of the chase
this field of glory is harvested
and the crop is already appropriated
but new reapers will arise
and they too will seek a field
it is to deny what the history of the world tells us is true
to suppose that men of ambition and talents will not continue to spring up amongst us
and when they do
they will as naturally seek the gratification of their ruling passion as others have done before them
the question then is
can that gratification be found in supporting and in maintaining an edifice that has been erected by others
most certainly it cannot
many great and good men
sufficiently qualified for any task they should undertake
may ever be found whose ambition would aspire to nothing beyond a seat in congress
a gubernatorial or a presidential chair but such belong not to the family of the lion
or the tribe of the eagle
think you these places would satisfy an alexander
a caesar
or a napoleon
towering genius disdains a beaten path
it seeks regions hitherto unexplored
it sees no distinction in adding story to story upon the monuments of fame erected to the memory of others
it denies that it is glory enough to serve under any chief
it scorns to tread in the footsteps of any predecessor
however illustrious
it thirsts and burns for distinction and if possible
it will have it
whether at the expense of emancipating slaves or enslaving freemen
is it unreasonable
to expect that some man possessed of the loftiest genius
coupled with ambition sufficient to push it to its utmost stretch
will at some time spring up among us
and when such an one does it will require the people to be united with each other
attached to the government and laws
and generally intelligent
to successfully frustrate his designs
distinction will be his paramount object
and although he would as willingly
perhaps more so
acquire it by doing good as harm
that opportunity being past
and nothing left to be done in the way of building up
he would set boldly to the task of pulling down
here then is a probable case
highly dangerous
and such an one as could not have well existed heretofore
another reason which once was
but which
to the same extent
is now no more
has done much in maintaining our institutions thus far
i mean the powerful influence which the interesting scenes of the revolution had upon the passions of the people as distinguished from their judgment
by this influence
the jealousy
and avarice incident to our nature
and so common to a state of peace
and conscious strength
were for the time in a great measure smothered and rendered inactive
while the deep rooted principles of hate
and the powerful motive of revenge
instead of being turned against each other
were directed exclusively against the british nation
and thus
from the force of circumstances
the basest principles of our nature were either made to lie dormant
or to become the active agents in the advancement of the noblest of causes that of establishing and maintaining civil and religious liberty
but this state of feeling must fade
is fading
has faded
with the circumstances that produced it
i do not mean to say that the scenes of the revolution are now or ever will be entirely forgotten
but that
like everything else
they must fade upon the memory of the world
and grow more and more dim by the lapse of time
in history
we hope
they will be read of
and recounted
so long as the bible shall be read but even granting that they will
their influence cannot be what it heretofore has been
even then they cannot be so universally known nor so vividly felt as they were by the generation just gone to rest
at the close of that struggle
nearly every adult male had been a participator in some of its scenes
the consequence was that of those scenes
in the form of a husband
a father
a son
or a brother
a living history was to be found in every family a history bearing the indubitable testimonies of its own authenticity
in the limbs mangled
in the scars of wounds received
in the midst of the very scenes related a history
that could be read and understood alike by all
the wise and the ignorant
the learned and the unlearned
but those histories are gone
they can be read no more forever
they were a fortress of strength but what invading foeman could never do the silent artillery of time has done the leveling of its walls
they are gone
they were a forest of giant oaks but the all restless hurricane has swept over them
and left only here and there a lonely trunk
despoiled of its verdure
shorn of its foliage
unshading and unshaded
to murmur in a few more gentle breezes
and to combat with its mutilated limbs a few more ruder storms
then to sink and be no more
they were pillars of the temple of liberty and now that they have crumbled away that temple must fall unless we
their descendants
supply their places with other pillars
hewn from the solid quarry of sober reason
passion has helped us
but can do so no more
it will in future be our enemy
reason cold
unimpassioned reason must furnish all the materials for our future support and defense
let those materials be moulded into general intelligence
sound morality
and in particular
a reverence for the constitution and laws and that we improved to the last
that we remained free to the last
that we revered his name to the last
that during his long sleep we permitted no hostile foot to pass over or desecrate his resting place
shall be that which to learn the last trump shall awaken our washington
upon these let the proud fabric of freedom rest
as the rock of its basis and as truly as has been said of the only greater institution
the gates of hell shall not prevail against it
protest in the illinois legislature on the subject of slavery
march 3
the following protest was presented to the house
which was read and ordered to be spread in the journals
to wit
resolutions upon the subject of domestic slavery having passed both branches of the general assembly at its present session
the undersigned hereby protest against the passage of the same
they believe that the institution of slavery is founded on both injustice and bad policy
but that the promulgation of abolition doctrines tends rather to increase than abate its evils
they believe that the congress of the united states has no power under the constitution to interfere with the institution of slavery in the different states
they believe that the congress of the united states has the power
under the constitution
to abolish slavery in the district of columbia
but that the power ought not to be exercised
unless at the request of the people of the district
the difference between these opinions and those contained in the said resolutions is their reason for entering this protest

miss mary s
friend mary
i have commenced two letters to send you before this
both of which displeased me before i got half done
and so i tore them up
the first i thought was not serious enough
and the second was on the other extreme
i shall send this
turn out as it may
this thing of living in springfield is rather a dull business
after all at least it is so to me
i am quite as lonesome here as i ever was anywhere in my life
i have been spoken to by but one woman since i have been here
and should not have been by her if she could have avoided it
i 've never been to church yet
and probably shall not be soon
i stay away because i am conscious i should not know how to behave myself
i am often thinking of what we said about your coming to live at springfield
i am afraid you would not be satisfied
there is a great deal of flourishing about in carriages here
which it would be your doom to see without sharing it
you would have to be poor
without the means of hiding your poverty
do you believe you could bear that patiently
whatever woman may cast her lot with mine
should any ever do so
it is my intention to do all in my power to make her happy and contented and there is nothing i can imagine that would make me more unhappy than to fail in the effort
i know i should be much happier with you than the way i am
provided i saw no signs of discontent in you
what you have said to me may have been in the way of jest
or i may have misunderstood you
if so
then let it be forgotten if otherwise
i much wish you would think seriously before you decide
what i have said i will most positively abide by
provided you wish it
my opinion is that you had better not do it
you have not been accustomed to hardship
and it may be more severe than you now imagine
i know you are capable of thinking correctly on any subject
and if you deliberate maturely upon this subject before you decide
then i am willing to abide your decision
you must write me a good long letter after you get this
you have nothing else to do
and though it might not seem interesting to you after you had written it
it would be a good deal of company to me in this busy wilderness
tell your sister i don't want to hear any more about selling out and moving
that gives me the hypo whenever i think of it
to john bennett
john bennett
dear sir
edwards tells me you wish to know whether the act to which your own incorporation provision was attached passed into a law
it did
you can organize under the general incorporation law as soon as you choose
i also tacked a provision onto a fellow's bill to authorize the relocation of the road from salem down to your town
but i am not certain whether or not the bill passed
neither do i suppose i can ascertain before the law will be published
if it is a law
bowling greene
bennette abe
and yourself are appointed to make the change
no news
no excitement except a little about the election of monday next
i suppose
of course
our friend dr
heney stands no chance in your diggings
your friend and humble servant
to mary owens
1837 friend mary
you will no doubt think it rather strange that i should write you a letter on the same day on which we parted
and i can only account for it by supposing that seeing you lately makes me think of you more than usual while at our late meeting we had but few expressions of thoughts
you must know that i cannot see you
or think of you
with entire indifference and yet it may be that you are mistaken in regard to what my real feelings toward you are
if i knew you were not
i should not have troubled you with this letter
perhaps any other man would know enough without information but i consider it my peculiar right to plead ignorance
and your bounden duty to allow the plea
i want in all cases to do right and most particularly so in all cases with women
i want
at this particular time
more than any thing else to do right with you and if i knew it would be doing right
as i rather suspect it would
to let you alone i would do it
for the purpose of making the matter as plain as possible
i now say that you can drop the subject
dismiss your thoughts if you ever had any from me for ever and leave this letter unanswered without calling forth one accusing murmur from me
and i will even go further and say that
if it will add anything to your comfort or peace of mind to do so
it is my sincere wish that you should
do not understand by this that i wish to cut your acquaintance
i mean no such thing
what i do wish is that our further acquaintance shall depend upon yourself
if such further acquaintance would contribute nothing to your happiness
i am sure it would not to mine
if you feel yourself in any degree bound to me
i am now willing to release you
provided you wish it while on the other hand i am willing and even anxious to bind you faster if i can be convinced that it will
in any considerable degree
add to your happiness
is the whole question with me
nothing would make me more miserable than to believe you miserable
nothing more happy than to know you were so
in what i have now said
i think i cannot be misunderstood and to make myself understood is the only object of this letter
if it suits you best not to answer this
a long life and a merry one attend you
if you conclude to write back
speak as plainly as i do
there can neither be harm nor danger in saying to me anything you think
just in the manner you think it
my respects to your sister
your friend
legal suit of widow v
adams to the people
sangamon journal
springfield
in accordance with our determination
as expressed last week
we present to the reader the articles which were published in hand bill form
in reference to the case of the heirs of joseph anderson vs
james adams
these articles can now be read uninfluenced by personal or party feeling
and with the sole motive of learning the truth
when that is done
the reader can pass his own judgment on the matters at issue
we only regret in this case
that the publications were not made some weeks before the election
such a course might have prevented the expressions of regret
which have often been heard since
from different individuals
on account of the disposition they made of their votes
to the public
it is well known to most of you
that there is existing at this time considerable excitement in regard to gen
adams's titles to certain tracts of land
and the manner in which he acquired them
as i understand
the gen
charges that the whole has been gotten up by a knot of lawyers to injure his election and as i am one of the knot to which he refers
and as i happen to be in possession of facts connected with the matter
i will
in as brief a manner as possible
make a statement of them
together with the means by which i arrived at the knowledge of them
sometime in may or june last
a widow woman
by the name of anderson
and her son
who resides in fulton county
came to springfield
for the purpose as they said of selling a ten acre lot of ground lying near town
which they claimed as the property of the deceased husband and father
when they reached town they found the land was claimed by gen
john t
stuart and myself were employed to look into the matter
and if it was thought we could do so with any prospect of success
to commence a suit for the land
i went immediately to the recorder's office to examine adams's title
and found that the land had been entered by one dixon
deeded by dixon to thomas
by thomas to one miller
and by miller to gen
the oldest of these three deeds was about ten or eleven years old
and the latest more than five
all recorded at the same time
and that within less than one year
this i thought a suspicious circumstance
and i was thereby induced to examine the deeds very closely
with a view to the discovery of some defect by which to overturn the title
being almost convinced then it was founded in fraud
i discovered that in the deed from thomas to miller
although miller's name stood in a sort of marginal note on the record book
it was nowhere in the deed itself
i told the fact to talbott
the recorder
and proposed to him that he should go to gen
adams's and get the original deed
and compare it with the record
and thereby ascertain whether the defect was in the original or there was merely an error in the recording
as talbott afterwards told me
he went to the general's
but not finding him at home
got the deed from his son
when compared with the record
proved what we had discovered was merely an error of the recorder
after mr
talbott corrected the record
he brought the original to our office
as i then thought and think yet
to show us that it was right
when he came into the room he handed the deed to me
remarking that the fault was all his own
on opening it
another paper fell out of it
which on examination proved to be an assignment of a judgment in the circuit court of sangamon county from joseph anderson
the late husband of the widow above named
to james adams
the judgment being in favor of said anderson against one joseph miller
knowing that this judgment had some connection with the land affair
i immediately took a copy of it
which is word for word
letter for letter and cross for cross as follows
joseph anderson
joseph miller
judgment in sangamon circuit court against joseph miller obtained on a note originally 25 dolls and interest thereon accrued
i assign all my right
title and interest to james adams which is in consideration of a debt i owe said adams
his joseph x anderson
as the copy shows
it bore date may 10
1827 although the judgment assigned by it was not obtained until the october afterwards
as may be seen by any one on the records of the circuit court
two other strange circumstances attended it which cannot be represented by a copy
one of them was
that the date 1827 had first been made 1837 and
without the figure 3
being fully obliterated
the figure 2 had afterwards been made on top of it the other was that
although the date was ten years old
the writing on it
from the freshness of its appearance
was thought by many
and i believe by all who saw it
not to be more than a week old
the paper on which it was written had a very old appearance and there were some old figures on the back of it which made the freshness of the writing on the face of it much more striking than i suppose it otherwise might have been
the reader's curiosity is no doubt excited to know what connection this assignment had with the land in question
the story is this
dixon sold and deeded the land to thomas thomas sold it to anderson but before he gave a deed
anderson sold it to miller
and took miller's note for the purchase money
when this note became due
anderson sued miller on it
and miller procured an injunction from the court of chancery to stay the collection of the money until he should get a deed for the land
adams was employed as an attorney by anderson in this chancery suit
and at the october term
the injunction was dissolved
and a judgment given in favor of anderson against miller and it was provided that thomas was to execute a deed for the land in favor of miller and deliver it to gen
to be held up by him till miller paid the judgment
and then to deliver it to him
miller left the county without paying the judgment
anderson moved to fulton county
where he has since died when the widow came to springfield last may or june
as before mentioned
and found the land deeded to gen
adams by miller
she was naturally led to inquire why the money due upon the judgment had not been sent to them
inasmuch as he
had no authority to deliver thomas's deed to miller until the money was paid
then it was the general told her
or perhaps her son
who came with her
that anderson
in his lifetime
had assigned the judgment to him
i am now told that the general is exhibiting an assignment of the same judgment bearing date 1828 and in other respects differing from the one described and that he is asserting that no such assignment as the one copied by me ever existed or if there did
it was forged between talbott and the lawyers
and slipped into his papers for the purpose of injuring him
i can only say that i know precisely such a one did exist
and that ben
john t
judge logan
robert irwin
canedy and s
all saw and examined it
and that at least one half of them will swear that it was in general adams's handwriting
and further
i know that talbott will swear that he got it out of the general's possession
and returned it into his possession again
the assignment which the general is now exhibiting purports to have been by anderson in writing
the one i copied was signed with a cross
i am told that gen
neale says that he will swear that he heard gen
adams tell young anderson that the assignment made by his father was signed with a cross
the above are 'facts
 as stated
i leave them without comment
i have given the names of persons who have knowledge of these facts
in order that any one who chooses may call on them and ascertain how far they will corroborate my statements
i have only made these statements because i am known by many to be one of the individuals against whom the charge of forging the assignment and slipping it into the general's papers has been made
and because our silence might be construed into a confession of its truth
i shall not subscribe my name but i hereby authorize the editor of the journal to give it up to any one that may call for it
lincoln and talbott in reply to gen
sangamon journal
springfield
in the republican of this morning a publication of gen
adams's appears
in which my name is used quite unreservedly
for this i thank the general
i thank him because it gives me an opportunity
without appearing obtrusive
of explaining a part of a former publication of mine
which appears to me to have been misunderstood by many
in the former publication alluded to
i stated
in substance
that mr
talbott got a deed from a son of gen
adams's for the purpose of correcting a mistake that had occurred on the record of the said deed in the recorder's office that he corrected the record
and brought the deed and handed it to me
and that on opening the deed
another paper
being the assignment of a judgment
fell out of it
this statement gen
adams and the editor of the republican have seized upon as a most palpable evidence of fabrication and falsehood
they set themselves gravely about proving that the assignment could not have been in the deed when talbott got it from young adams
as he
would have seen it when he opened the deed to correct the record
the truth is
talbott did see the assignment when he opened the deed
or at least he told me he did on the same day and i only omitted to say so
in my former publication
because it was a matter of such palpable and necessary inference
i had stated that talbott had corrected the record by the deed and of course he must have opened it and
just as the general and his friends argue
must have seen the assignment
i omitted to state the fact of talbott's seeing the assignment
because its existence was so necessarily connected with other facts which i did state
that i thought the greatest dunce could not but understand it
did i say talbott had not seen it
did i say anything that was inconsistent with his having seen it before
most certainly i did neither and if i did not
what becomes of the argument
these logical gentlemen can sustain their argument only by assuming that i did say negatively everything that i did not say affirmatively and upon the same assumption
we may expect to find the general
if a little harder pressed for argument
saying that i said talbott came to our office with his head downward
not that i actually said so
but because i omitted to say he came feet downward
in his publication to day
the general produces the affidavit of reuben radford
in which it is said that talbott told radford that he did not find the assignment in the deed
in the recording of which the error was committed
but that he found it wrapped in another paper in the recorder's office
upon which statement the genl
comments as follows
to wit
if it be true as stated by talbott to radford
that he found the assignment wrapped up in another paper at his office
that contradicts the statement of lincoln that it fell out of the deed
is common sense to be abused with such sophistry
did i say what talbott found it in
if talbott did find it in another paper at his office
is that any reason why he could not have folded it in a deed and brought it to my office
can any one be so far duped as to be made believe that what may have happened at talbot's office at one time is inconsistent with what happened at my office at another time
now talbott's statement of the case as he makes it to me is this
that he got a bunch of deeds from young adams
and that he knows he found the assignment in the bunch
but he is not certain which particular deed it was in
nor is he certain whether it was folded in the same deed out of which it was taken
or another one
when it was brought to my office
is this a mysterious story
is there anything suspicious about it
but it is useless to dwell longer on this point
any man who is not wilfully blind can see at a flash
that there is no discrepancy
and lincoln has shown that they are not only inconsistent with truth
but each other i can only say
that i have shown that he has done no such thing and if the reader is disposed to require any other evidence than the general's assertion
he will be of my opinion
excepting the general's most flimsy attempt at mystification
in regard to a discrepance between talbott and myself
he has not denied a single statement that i made in my hand bill
every material statement that i made has been sworn to by men who
in former times
were thought as respectable as general adams
i stated that an assignment of a judgment
a copy of which i gave
had existed benj
and judge logan swore to its existence
i stated that it was said to be in gen
adams's handwriting the same men swore it was in his handwriting
i stated that talbott would swear that he got it out of gen
adams's possession talbott came forward and did swear it
bidding adieu to the former publication
i now propose to examine the general's last gigantic production
i now propose to point out some discrepancies in the general's address and such
as he shall not be able to escape from
speaking of the famous assignment
the general says
this last charge
which was their last resort
their dying effort to render my character infamous among my fellow citizens
was manufactured at a certain lawyer's office in the town
printed at the office of the sangamon journal
and found its way into the world some time between two days just before the last election
now turn to mr
keys' affidavit
in which you will find the following
i certify that some time in may or the early part of june
i saw at williams's corner a paper purporting to be an assignment from joseph anderson to james adams
which assignment was signed by a mark to anderson's name
etc
now mark
if keys saw the assignment on the last of may or first of june
adams tells a falsehood when he says it was manufactured just before the election
which was on the 7th of august and if it was manufactured just before the election
keys tells a falsehood when he says he saw it on the last of may or first of june
either keys or the general is irretrievably in for it and in the general's very condescending language
i say let them settle it between them
now again
let the reader
bearing in mind that general adams has unequivocally said
in one part of his address
that the charge in relation to the assignment was manufactured just before the election
turn to the affidavit of peter s
where the following will be found viz
peter s
do certify that from the best of my recollection
on the day or day after gen
adams started for the illinois rapids
in may last
that i was at the house of gen
sitting in the kitchen
situated on the back part of the house
it being in the afternoon
and that benjamin talbott came around the house
back into the kitchen
and appeared wild and confused
and that he laid a package of papers on the kitchen table and requested that they should be handed to lucian
he made no apology for coming to the kitchen
nor for not handing them to lucian himself
but showed the token of being frightened and confused both in demeanor and speech and for what cause i could not apprehend
commenting on weber's affidavit
adams asks
why this fright and confusion
i reply that this is a question for the general himself
weber says that it was in may
and if so
it is most clear that talbott was not frightened on account of the assignment
unless the general lies when he says the assignment charge was manufactured just before the election
is it not a strong evidence
that the general is not traveling with the pole star of truth in his front
to see him in one part of his address roundly asserting that the assignment was manufactured just before the election
and then
forgetting that position
procuring weber's most foolish affidavit
to prove that talbott had been engaged in manufacturing it two months before
in another part of his address
adams says
that i hold an assignment of said judgment
dated the 20th of may
and signed by said anderson
i have never pretended to deny or conceal
but stated that fact in one of my circulars previous to the election
and also in answer to a bill in chancery
now i pronounce this statement unqualifiedly false
and shall not rely on the word or oath of any man to sustain me in what i say but will let the whole be decided by reference to the circular and answer in chancery of which the general speaks
in his circular he did speak of an assignment but he did not say it bore date 20th of may
1828 nor did he say it bore any date
in his answer in chancery
he did say that he had an assignment but he did not say that it bore date the 20th may
1828 but so far from it
he said on oath for he swore to the answer that as well as recollected
he obtained it in 1827
if any one doubts
let him examine the circular and answer for himself
they are both accessible
it will readily be observed that the principal part of adams's defense rests upon the argument that if he had been base enough to forge an assignment he would not have been fool enough to forge one that would not cover the case
this argument he used in his circular before the election
the republican has used it at least once
since then and adams uses it again in his publication of to day
now i pledge myself to show that he is just such a fool that he and his friends have contended it was impossible for him to be
recollect he says he has a genuine assignment and that he got joseph klein's affidavit
stating that he had seen it
and that he believed the signature to have been executed by the same hand that signed anderson's name to the answer in chancery
luckily klein took a copy of this genuine assignment
which i have been permitted to see and hence i know it does not cover the case
in the first place it is headed joseph anderson vs
joseph miller
and heads off judgment in sangamon circuit court
now
there never was a case in sangamon circuit court entitled joseph anderson vs
joseph miller
the case mentioned in my former publication
and the only one between these parties that ever existed in the circuit court
was entitled joseph miller vs
joseph anderson
miller being the plaintiff
what then becomes of all their sophistry about adams not being fool enough to forge an assignment that would not cover the case
it is certain that the present one does not cover the case and if he got it honestly
it is still clear that he was fool enough to pay for an assignment that does not cover the case
the general asks for the proof of disinterested witnesses
whom does he consider disinterested
none can be more so than those who have already testified against him
no one of them had the least interest on earth
so far as i can learn
to injure him
he says they had conspired against him but if the testimony of an angel from heaven were introduced against him
he would make the same charge of conspiracy
and now i put the question to every reflecting man
do you believe that benjamin talbott
william butler and stephen t
all sustaining high and spotless characters
and justly proud of them
would deliberately perjure themselves
without any motive whatever
except to injure a man's election and that
a man who had been a candidate
time out of mind
and yet who had never been elected to any office
adams's assurance
in demanding disinterested testimony
is surpassing
he brings in the affidavit of his own son
and even of peter s
with whom i am not acquainted
but who
i suppose
is some black or mulatto boy
from his being kept in the kitchen
to prove his points but when such a man as talbott
a man who
but two years ago
ran against gen
adams for the office of recorder and beat him more than four votes to one
is introduced against him
he asks the community
with all the consequence of a lord
to reject his testimony
i might easily write a volume
pointing out inconsistencies between the statements in adams's last address with one another
and with other known facts but i am aware the reader must already be tired with the length of this article
his opening statements
that he was first accused of being a tory
and that he refuted that that then the sampson's ghost story was got up
and he refuted that that as a last resort
a dying effort
the assignment charge was got up is all as false as hell
as all this community must know
sampson's ghost first made its appearance in print
and that
after keys swears he saw the assignment
as any one may see by reference to the files of papers and gen
adams himself
in reply to the sampson's ghost story
was the first man that raised the cry of toryism
and it was only by way of set off
and never in seriousness
that it was bandied back at him
his effort is to make the impression that his enemies first made the charge of toryism and he drove them from that
then sampson's ghost
he drove them from that
then finally the assignment charge was manufactured just before election
the only general reply he ever made to the sampson's ghost and tory charges he made at one and the same time
and not in succession as he states and the date of that reply will show
that it was made at least a month after the date on which keys swears he saw the anderson assignment
but enough
in conclusion i will only say that i have a character to defend as well as gen
but i disdain to whine about it as he does
it is true i have no children nor kitchen boys and if i had
i should scorn to lug them in to make affidavits for me
september 6
adams controversy continued to the public
sangamon journal
springfield
such is the turn which things have taken lately
that when gen
adams writes a book
i am expected to write a commentary on it
in the republican of this morning he has presented the world with a new work of six columns in length in consequence of which i must beg the room of one column in the journal
it is obvious that a minute reply cannot be made in one column to everything that can be said in six and
i hope that expectation will be answered if i reply to such parts of the general's publication as are worth replying to
it may not be improper to remind the reader that in his publication of sept
6th general adams said that the assignment charge was manufactured just before the election and that in reply i proved that statement to be false by keys
his own witness
without attempting to explain
he furnishes me with another witness tinsley by which the same thing is proved
to wit
that the assignment was not manufactured just before the election but that it was some weeks before
let it be borne in mind that adams made this statement has himself furnished two witnesses to prove its falsehood
and does not attempt to deny or explain it
before going farther
let a pin be stuck here
labeled one lie proved and confessed
on the 6th of september he said he had before stated in the hand bill that he held an assignment dated may 20th
which in reply i pronounced to be false
and referred to the hand bill for the truth of what i said
this week he forgets to make any explanation of this
let another pin be stuck here
labelled as before
i mention these things because
when i convict him in one falsehood
he is permitted to shift his ground and pass it by in silence
there can be no end to this controversy
the first thing that attracts my attention in the general's present production is the information he is pleased to give to those who are made to suffer at his my hands
under present circumstances
this cannot apply to me
for i am not a widow nor an orphan
nor have i a wife or children who might by possibility become such
i have no doubt
have been
and will again be made to suffer at his hands
they are the mischievous agents
the next thing i shall notice is his favorite expression
not of lawyers
doctors and others
which he is so fond of applying to all who dare expose his rascality
let it be remembered that when he first came to this country he attempted to impose himself upon the community as a lawyer
and actually carried the attempt so far as to induce a man who was under a charge of murder to entrust the defence of his life in his hands
and finally took his money and got him hanged
is this the man that is to raise a breeze in his favor by abusing lawyers
if he is not himself a lawyer
it is for the lack of sense
and not of inclination
if he is not a lawyer
he is a liar
for he proclaimed himself a lawyer
and got a man hanged by depending on him
passing over such parts of the article as have neither fact nor argument in them
i come to the question asked by adams whether any person ever saw the assignment in his possession
this is an insult to common sense
talbott has sworn once and repeated time and again
that he got it out of adams's possession and returned it into the same possession
as though he was addressing fools
he has assurance to ask if any person ever saw it in his possession
next i quote a sentence
now my son lucian swears that when talbott called for the deed
that he
opened it and pointed out the error
true
his son lucian did swear as he says and in doing so
he swore what i will prove by his own affidavit to be a falsehood
turn to lucian's affidavit
and you will there see that talbott called for the deed by which to correct an error on the record
thus it appears that the error in question was on the record
and not in the deed
how then could talbott open the deed and point out the error
where a thing is not
it cannot be pointed out
the error was not in the deed
and of course could not be pointed out there
this does not merely prove that the error could not be pointed out
as lucian swore it was but it proves
that the deed was not opened in his presence with a special view to the error
for if it had been
he could not have failed to see that there was no error in it
it is easy enough to see why lucian swore this
his object was to prove that the assignment was not in the deed when talbott got it
but it was discovered he could not swear this safely
without first swearing the deed was opened and if he swore it was opened
he must show a motive for opening it
and the conclusion with him and his father was that the pointing out the error would appear the most plausible
for the purpose of showing that the assignment was not in the bundle when talbott got it
is the story introduced into lucian's affidavit that the deeds were counted
it is a remarkable fact
and one that should stand as a warning to all liars and fabricators
that in this short affidavit of lucian's he only attempted to depart from the truth
so far as i have the means of knowing
in two points
to wit
in the opening the deed and pointing out the error and the counting of the deeds
and in both of these he caught himself
about the counting
he caught himself thus after saying the bundle contained five deeds and a lease
he proceeds
and i saw no other papers than the said deed and lease
first he has six papers
and then he saw none but two for my son lucian's benefit
let a pin be stuck here
adams again adduces the argument
that he could not have forged the assignment
for the reason that he could have had no motive for it
with those that know the facts there is no absence of motive
admitting the paper which he has filed in the suit to be genuine
it is clear that it cannot answer the purpose for which he designs it
hence his motive for making one that he supposed would answer is obvious
his making the date too old is also easily enough accounted for
the records were not in his hands
and then
there being some considerable talk upon this particular subject
he knew he could not examine the records to ascertain the precise dates without subjecting himself to suspicion and hence he concluded to try it by guess
as it turned out
missed it a little
about miller's deposition i have a word to say
in the first place
miller's answer to the first question shows upon its face that he had been tampered with
and the answer dictated to him
he was asked if he knew joel wright and james adams and above three fourths of his answer consists of what he knew about joseph anderson
a man about whom nothing had been asked
nor a word said in the question a fact that can only be accounted for upon the supposition that adams had secretly told him what he wished him to swear to
another of miller's answers i will prove both by common sense and the court of record is untrue
to one question he answers
anderson brought a suit against me before james adams
then an acting justice of the peace in sangamon county
before whom he obtained a judgment
did you remove the same by injunction to the sangamon circuit court
i did remove it
now mark it is said he removed it by injunction
the word injunction in common language imports a command that some person or thing shall not move or be removed in law it has the same meaning
an injunction issuing out of chancery to a justice of the peace is a command to him to stop all proceedings in a named case until further orders
it is not an order to remove but to stop or stay something that is already moving
besides this
the records of the sangamon circuit court show that the judgment of which miller swore was never removed into said court by injunction or otherwise
i have now to take notice of a part of adams's address which in the order of time should have been noticed before
it is in these words
i have now shown
in the opinion of two competent judges
that the handwriting of the forged assignment differed from mine
and by one of them that it could not be mistaken for mine
that is false
tinsley no doubt is the judge referred to and by reference to his certificate it will be seen that he did not say the handwriting of the assignment could not be mistaken for adams's nor did he use any other expression substantially
or anything near substantially
the same
but if tinsley had said the handwriting could not be mistaken for adams's
it would have been equally unfortunate for adams
for it then would have contradicted keys
who says
i looked at the writing and judged it the said adams's or a good imitation
adams speaks with much apparent confidence of his success on attending lawsuits
and the ultimate maintenance of his title to the land in question
without wishing to disturb the pleasure of his dream
i would say to him that it is not impossible that he may yet be taught to sing a different song in relation to the matter
at the end of miller's deposition
adams asks
will mr
lincoln now say that he is almost convinced my title to this ten acre tract of land is founded in fraud
i answer
i will not
i will now change the phraseology so as to make it run i am quite convinced
i cannot pass in silence adams's assertion that he has proved that the forged assignment was not in the deed when it came from his house by talbott
the recorder
in this
although talbott has sworn that the assignment was in the bundle of deeds when it came from his house
adams has the unaccountable assurance to say that he has proved the contrary by talbott
let him or his friends attempt to show wherein he proved any such thing by talbott
in his publication of the 6th of september he hinted to talbott
that he might be mistaken
in his present
speaking of talbott and me he says they may have been imposed upon
can any man of the least penetration fail to see the object of this
after he has stormed and raged till he hopes and imagines he has got us a little scared he wishes to softly whisper in our ears
if you'll quit i will
if he could get us to say that some unknown
undefined being had slipped the assignment into our hands without our knowledge
not a doubt remains but that he would immediately discover that we were the purest men on earth
this is the ground he evidently wishes us to understand he is willing to compromise upon
but we ask no such charity at his hands
we are neither mistaken nor imposed upon
we have made the statements we have because we know them to be true and we choose to live or die by them
who is adams's friend
personal and political
will recollect
on the 5th of this month
he adams
with a great affectation of modesty
declared that he would never introduce his own child as a witness
notwithstanding this affectation of modesty
he has in his present publication introduced his child as witness and as if to show with how much contempt he could treat his own declaration
he has had this same esq
carter to administer the oath to him
and so important a witness does he consider him
and so entirely does the whole of his entire present production depend upon the testimony of his child
that in it he has mentioned my son
my son lucian
lucian
my son
and the like expressions no less than fifteen different times
let it be remembered here
that i have shown the affidavit of my darling son lucian to be false by the evidence apparent on its own face and i now ask if that affidavit be taken away what foundation will the fabric have left to stand upon
general adams's publications and out door maneuvering
taken in connection with the editorial articles of the republican
are not more foolish and contradictory than they are ludicrous and amusing
one week the republican notifies the public that gen
adams is preparing an instrument that will tear
blow up
burst asunder
and grind to powder all its slanderers
and particularly talbott and lincoln all of which is to be done in due time
then for two or three weeks all is calm not a word said
again the republican comes forth with a mere passing remark that public opinion has decided in favor of gen
and intimates that he will give himself no more trouble about the matter
in the meantime adams himself is prowling about and
as burns says of the devil
for prey
and holes and corners tryin
and in one instance goes so far as to take an old acquaintance of mine several steps from a crowd and
apparently weighed down with the importance of his business
gravely and solemnly asks him if he ever heard lincoln say he was a deist
anon the republican comes again
we invite the attention of the public to general adams's communication
c
the victory is a great one
the triumph is overwhelming
i really believe the editor of the illinois republican is fool enough to think general adams leads off authors most egregiously mistaken c
most woefully shall their presumption be punished
c
lord have mercy on us
the hour is yet to come
nigh at hand how long first do you reckon
when the journal and its junto shall say
i have appeared too early
their infamy shall be laid bare to the public gaze
suddenly the general appears to relent at the severity with which he is treating us and he exclaims
the condemnation of my enemies is the inevitable result of my own defense
for your health's sake
dear gen
do not permit your tenderness of heart to afflict you so much on our account
for some reason perhaps because we are killed so quickly we shall never be sensible of our suffering
i will see you again at court if not before when and where we will settle the question whether you or the widow shall have the land
october 18
1838 to mrs
browning a farce springfield
april 1
dear madam
without apologizing for being egotistical
i shall make the history of so much of my life as has elapsed since i saw you the subject of this letter
by the way
i now discover that
in order to give a full and intelligible account of the things i have done and suffered since i saw you
i shall necessarily have to relate some that happened before
it was
in the autumn of 1836 that a married lady of my acquaintance
and who was a great friend of mine
being about to pay a visit to her father and other relatives residing in kentucky
proposed to me that on her return she would bring a sister of hers with her on condition that i would engage to become her brother in law with all convenient despatch
of course
accepted the proposal
for you know i could not have done otherwise had i really been averse to it but privately
between you and me
i was most confoundedly well pleased with the project
i had seen the said sister some three years before
thought her intelligent and agreeable
and saw no good objection to plodding life through hand in hand with her
time passed on the lady took her journey and in due time returned
sister in company
sure enough
this astonished me a little
for it appeared to me that her coming so readily showed that she was a trifle too willing
but on reflection it occurred to me that she might have been prevailed on by her married sister to come without anything concerning me ever having been mentioned to her
and so i concluded that if no other objection presented itself
i would consent to waive this
all this occurred to me on hearing of her arrival in the neighborhood for
be it remembered
i had not yet seen her
except about three years previous
as above mentioned
in a few days we had an interview
although i had seen her before
she did not look as my imagination had pictured her
i knew she was over size
but she now appeared a fair match for falstaff
i knew she was called an old maid
and i felt no doubt of the truth of at least half of the appellation
but now
when i beheld her
i could not for my life avoid thinking of my mother and this
not from withered features
for her skin was too full of fat to permit of its contracting into wrinkles
but from her want of teeth
weather beaten appearance in general
and from a kind of notion that ran in my head that nothing could have commenced at the size of infancy and reached her present bulk in less than thirty five or forty years and in short
i was not at all pleased with her
but what could i do
i had told her sister that i would take her for better or for worse
and i made a point of honor and conscience in all things to stick to my word especially if others had been induced to act on it which in this case i had no doubt they had
for i was now fairly convinced that no other man on earth would have her
and hence the conclusion that they were bent on holding me to my bargain
thought i
i have said it
be the consequences what they may
it shall not be my fault if i fail to do it
at once i determined to consider her my wife and
this done
all my powers of discovery were put to work in search of perfections in her which might be fairly set off against her defects
i tried to imagine her handsome
but for her unfortunate corpulency
was actually true
exclusive of this no woman that i have ever seen has a finer face
i also tried to convince myself that the mind was much more to be valued than the person and in this she was not inferior
as i could discover
to any with whom i had been acquainted
shortly after this
without coming to any positive understanding with her
i set out for vandalia
when and where you first saw me
during my stay there i had letters from her which did not change my opinion of either her intellect or intention
but on the contrary confirmed it in both
all this while
although i was fixed
firm as the surge repelling rock
in my resolution
i found i was continually repenting the rashness which had led me to make it
through life
i have been in no bondage
either real or imaginary
from the thraldom of which i so much desired to be free
after my return home
i saw nothing to change my opinions of her in any particular
she was the same
and so was i
i now spent my time in planning how i might get along through life after my contemplated change of circumstances should have taken place
and how i might procrastinate the evil day for a time
which i really dreaded as much
perhaps more
than an irishman does the halter
after all my suffering upon this deeply interesting subject
here i am
out of the scrape and now i want to know if you can guess how i got out of it out
in every sense of the term no violation of word
or conscience
i don't believe you can guess
and so i might as well tell you at once
as the lawyer says
it was done in the manner following
to wit
after i had delayed the matter as long as i thought i could in honor do which
by the way
had brought me round into the last fall
i concluded i might as well bring it to a consummation without further delay and so i mustered my resolution
and made the proposal to her direct but
shocking to relate
she answered
at first i supposed she did it through an affectation of modesty
which i thought but ill became her under the peculiar circumstances of her case but on my renewal of the charge
i found she repelled it with greater firmness than before
i tried it again and again but with the same success
or rather with the same want of success
i finally was forced to give it up at which i very unexpectedly found myself mortified almost beyond endurance
i was mortified
it seemed to me
in a hundred different ways
my vanity was deeply wounded by the reflection that i had been too stupid to discover her intentions
and at the same time never doubting that i understood them perfectly
and also that she
whom i had taught myself to believe nobody else would have
had actually rejected me with all my fancied greatness
to cap the whole
i then for the first time began to suspect that i was really a little in love with her
but let it all go
i'll try and outlive it
others have been made fools of by the girls
but this can never with truth be said of me
i most emphatically in this instance
made a fool of myself
i have now come to the conclusion never again to think of marrying
and for this reason
i can never be satisfied with any one who would be blockhead enough to have me
when you receive this
write me a long yarn about something to amuse me
give my respects to mr
your sincere friend
1839 remarks on sale of public lands in the house of representatives
january 17
from committee on finance
to which the subject was referred
made a report on the subject of purchasing of the united states all the unsold lands lying within the limits of the state of illinois
accompanied by resolutions that this state propose to purchase all unsold lands at twenty five cents per acre
and pledging the faith of the state to carry the proposal into effect if the government accept the same within two years
lincoln thought the resolutions ought to be seriously considered
in reply to the gentleman from adams
he said that it was not to enrich the state
the price of the lands may be raised
it was thought by some by others
that it would be reduced
the conclusion in his mind was that the representatives in this legislature from the country in which the lands lie would be opposed to raising the price
because it would operate against the settlement of the lands
he referred to the lands in the military tract
they had fallen into the hands of large speculators in consequence of the low price
he was opposed to a low price of land
he thought it was adverse to the interests of the poor settler
because speculators buy them up
he was opposed to a reduction of the price of public lands
lincoln referred to some official documents emanating from indiana
and compared the progressive population of the two states
illinois had gained upon that state under the public land system as it is
his conclusion was that ten years from this time illinois would have no more public land unsold than indiana now has
he referred also to ohio
that state had sold nearly all her public lands
she was but twenty years ahead of us
and as our lands were equally salable more so
as he maintained we should have no more twenty years from now than she has at present
lincoln referred to the canal lands
and supposed that the policy of the state would be different in regard to them
if the representatives from that section of country could themselves choose the policy but the representatives from other parts of the state had a veto upon it
and regulated the policy
he thought that if the state had all the lands
the policy of the legislature would be more liberal to all sections
he referred to the policy of the general government
he thought that if the national debt had not been paid
the expenses of the government would not have doubled
as they had done since that debt was paid

1839 dear row
redman informs me that you wish me to write you the particulars of a conversation between dr
felix and myself relative to you
the dr
overtook me between rushville and beardstown
after learning that i had lived at springfield
asked if i was acquainted with you
i told him i was
he said you had lately been elected constable in adams
but that you never would be again
i asked him why
he said the people there had found out that you had been sheriff or deputy sheriff in sangamon county
and that you came off and left your securities to suffer
he then asked me if i did not know such to be the fact
i told him i did not think you had ever been sheriff or deputy sheriff in sangamon
but that i thought you had been constable
i further told him that if you had left your securities to suffer in that or any other case
i had never heard of it
and that if it had been so
i thought i would have heard of it
if the dr
is telling that i told him anything against you whatever
i authorize you to contradict it flatly
we have no news here
your friend
as ever
speech on national bank in the hall of the house of representatives springfield
december 20
it is peculiarly embarrassing to me to attempt a continuance of the discussion
on this evening
which has been conducted in this hall on several preceding ones
it is so because on each of those evenings there was a much fuller attendance than now
without any reason for its being so
except the greater interest the community feel in the speakers who addressed them then than they do in him who is to do so now
i am
apprehensive that the few who have attended have done so more to spare me mortification than in the hope of being interested in anything i may be able to say
this circumstance casts a damp upon my spirits
which i am sure i shall be unable to overcome during the evening
but enough of preface
the subject heretofore and now to be discussed is the subtreasury scheme of the present administration
as a means of collecting
and disbursing
the revenues of the nation
as contrasted with a national bank for the same purposes
douglas has said that we the whigs have not dared to meet them the locos in argument on this question
i protest against this assertion
i assert that we have again and again
during this discussion
urged facts and arguments against the subtreasury which they have neither dared to deny nor attempted to answer
but lest some may be led to believe that we really wish to avoid the question
i now propose
in my humble way
to urge those arguments again at the same time begging the audience to mark well the positions i shall take and the proof i shall offer to sustain them
and that they will not again permit mr
douglas or his friends to escape the force of them by a round and groundless assertion that we dare not meet them in argument
of the subtreasury
as contrasted with a national bank for the before enumerated purposes
i lay down the following propositions
to wit
1 it will injuriously affect the community by its operation on the circulating medium
2 it will be a more expensive fiscal agent
3 it will be a less secure depository of the public money
to show the truth of the first proposition
let us take a short review of our condition under the operation of a national bank
it was the depository of the public revenues
between the collection of those revenues and the disbursement of them by the government
the bank was permitted to and did actually loan them out to individuals
and hence the large amount of money actually collected for revenue purposes
which by any other plan would have been idle a great portion of the time
was kept almost constantly in circulation
any person who will reflect that money is only valuable while in circulation will readily perceive that any device which will keep the government revenues in constant circulation
instead of being locked up in idleness
is no inconsiderable advantage
by the subtreasury the revenue is to be collected and kept in iron boxes until the government wants it for disbursement thus robbing the people of the use of it
while the government does not itself need it
and while the money is performing no nobler office than that of rusting in iron boxes
the natural effect of this change of policy
every one will see
is to reduce the quantity of money in circulation
by the subtreasury scheme the revenue is to be collected in specie
i anticipate that this will be disputed
i expect to hear it said that it is not the policy of the administration to collect the revenue in specie
if it shall
i reply that mr
van buren
in his message recommending the subtreasury
expended nearly a column of that document in an attempt to persuade congress to provide for the collection of the revenue in specie exclusively and he concludes with these words
it may be safely assumed that no motive of convenience to the citizens requires the reception of bank paper
in addition to this
silas wright
senator from new york
and the political
personal and confidential friend of mr
van buren
drafted and introduced into the senate the first subtreasury bill
and that bill provided for ultimately collecting the revenue in specie
it is true
i know
that that clause was stricken from the bill
but it was done by the votes of the whigs
aided by a portion only of the van buren senators
no subtreasury bill has yet become a law
though two or three have been considered by congress
some with and some without the specie clause so that i admit there is room for quibbling upon the question of whether the administration favor the exclusive specie doctrine or not but i take it that the fact that the president at first urged the specie doctrine
and that under his recommendation the first bill introduced embraced it
warrants us in charging it as the policy of the party until their head as publicly recants it as he at first espoused it
i repeat
that by the subtreasury the revenue is to be collected in specie
now mark what the effect of this must be
by all estimates ever made there are but between sixty and eighty millions of specie in the united states
the expenditures of the government for the year 1838 the last for which we have had the report were forty millions
thus it is seen that if the whole revenue be collected in specie
it will take more than half of all the specie in the nation to do it
by this means more than half of all the specie belonging to the fifteen millions of souls who compose the whole population of the country is thrown into the hands of the public office holders
and other public creditors comprising in number perhaps not more than one quarter of a million
leaving the other fourteen millions and three quarters to get along as they best can
with less than one half of the specie of the country
and whatever rags and shinplasters they may be able to put
and keep
in circulation
by this means
every office holder and other public creditor may
and most likely will
set up shaver and a most glorious harvest will the specie men have of it
each specie man
upon a fair division
having to his share the fleecing of about fifty nine rag men
in all candor let me ask
was such a system for benefiting the few at the expense of the many ever before devised
and was the sacred name of democracy ever before made to indorse such an enormity against the rights of the people
i have already said that the subtreasury will reduce the quantity of money in circulation
this position is strengthened by the recollection that the revenue is to be collected in specie
so that the mere amount of revenue is not all that is withdrawn
but the amount of paper circulation that the forty millions would serve as a basis to is withdrawn
which would be in a sound state at least one hundred millions
when one hundred millions
or more
of the circulation we now have shall be withdrawn
who can contemplate without terror the distress
and beggary that must follow
the man who has purchased any article say a horse on credit
at one hundred dollars
when there are two hundred millions circulating in the country
if the quantity be reduced to one hundred millions by the arrival of pay day
will find the horse but sufficient to pay half the debt and the other half must either be paid out of his other means
and thereby become a clear loss to him
or go unpaid
and thereby become a clear loss to his creditor
what i have here said of a single case of the purchase of a horse will hold good in every case of a debt existing at the time a reduction in the quantity of money occurs
by whomsoever
and for whatsoever
it may have been contracted
it may be said that what the debtor loses the creditor gains by this operation but on examination this will be found true only to a very limited extent
it is more generally true that all lose by it the creditor by losing more of his debts than he gains by the increased value of those he collects the debtor by either parting with more of his property to pay his debts than he received in contracting them
or by entirely breaking up his business
and thereby being thrown upon the world in idleness
the general distress thus created will
to be sure
be temporary
whatever change may occur in the quantity of money in any community
time will adjust the derangement produced but while that adjustment is progressing
all suffer more or less
and very many lose everything that renders life desirable
shall we suffer a severe difficulty
even though it be but temporary
unless we receive some equivalent for it
what i have been saying as to the effect produced by a reduction of the quantity of money relates to the whole country
i now propose to show that it would produce a peculiar and permanent hardship upon the citizens of those states and territories in which the public lands lie
the land offices in those states and territories
as all know
form the great gulf by which all
or nearly all
the money in them is swallowed up
when the quantity of money shall be reduced
and consequently everything under individual control brought down in proportion
the price of those lands
being fixed by law
will remain as now
of necessity it will follow that the produce or labor that now raises money sufficient to purchase eighty acres will then raise but sufficient to purchase forty
or perhaps not that much and this difficulty and hardship will last as long
in some degree
as any portion of these lands shall remain undisposed of
as i well do
the difficulty that poor people now encounter in procuring homes
i hesitate not to say that when the price of the public lands shall be doubled or trebled
which is the same thing
produce and labor cut down to one half or one third of their present prices
it will be little less than impossible for them to procure those homes at all
what did become of him
postmaster general barry why
the president immediately expressed his high disapprobation of his almost unequaled incapacity and corruption by appointing him to a foreign mission
with a salary and outfit of 18
000 a year
the party now attempt to throw barry off
and to avoid the responsibility of his sins
did not the president indorse those sins when
on the very heel of their commission
he appointed their author to the very highest and most honorable office in his gift
and which is but a single step behind the very goal of american political ambition
i return to another of mr
douglas's excuses for the expenditures of 1838
at the same time announcing the pleasing intelligence that this is the last one
he says that ten millions of that year's expenditure was a contingent appropriation
to prosecute an anticipated war with great britain on the maine boundary question
few words will settle this
that the ten millions appropriated was not made till 1839
and consequently could not have been expended in 1838 second
although it was appropriated
it has never been expended at all
those who heard mr
douglas recollect that he indulged himself in a contemptuous expression of pity for me
now he's got me
thought i
but when he went on to say that five millions of the expenditure of 1838 were payments of the french indemnities
which i knew to be untrue that five millions had been for the post office
which i knew to be untrue that ten millions had been for the maine boundary war
which i not only knew to be untrue
but supremely ridiculous also and when i saw that he was stupid enough to hope that i would permit such groundless and audacious assertions to go unexposed
i readily consented that
on the score both of veracity and sagacity
the audience should judge whether he or i were the more deserving of the world's contempt
lamborn insists that the difference between the van buren party and the whigs is that
although the former sometimes err in practice
they are always correct in principle
whereas the latter are wrong in principle and
better to impress this proposition
he uses a figurative expression in these words
the democrats are vulnerable in the heel
but they are sound in the head and the heart
the first branch of the figure that is
that the democrats are vulnerable in the heel i admit is not merely figuratively
but literally true
who that looks but for a moment at their swartwouts
their prices
their harringtons
and their hundreds of others
scampering away with the public money to texas
to europe
and to every spot of the earth where a villain may hope to find refuge from justice
can at all doubt that they are most distressingly affected in their heels with a species of running itch
it seems that this malady of their heels operates on these sound headed and honest hearted creatures very much like the cork leg in the comic song did on its owner
when he had once got started on it
the more he tried to stop it
the more it would run away
at the hazard of wearing this point threadbare
i will relate an anecdote which seems too strikingly in point to be omitted
a witty irish soldier
who was always boasting of his bravery when no danger was near
but who invariably retreated without orders at the first charge of an engagement
being asked by his captain why he did so
i have as brave a heart as julius caesar ever had but
somehow or other
whenever danger approaches
my cowardly legs will run away with it
so with mr
lamborn's party
they take the public money into their hand for the most laudable purpose that wise heads and honest hearts can dictate but before they can possibly get it out again
their rascally vulnerable heels will run away with them
seriously this proposition of mr
lamborn is nothing more or less than a request that his party may be tried by their professions instead of their practices
perhaps no position that the party assumes is more liable to or more deserving of exposure than this very modest request and nothing but the unwarrantable length to which i have already extended these remarks forbids me now attempting to expose it
for the reason given
i pass it by
i shall advert to but one more point
lamborn refers to the late elections in the states
and from their results confidently predicts that every state in the union will vote for mr
van buren at the next presidential election
address that argument to cowards and to knaves with the free and the brave it will effect nothing
it may be true if it must
let it
many free countries have lost their liberty
and ours may lose hers but if she shall
be it my proudest plume
not that i was the last to desert
but that i never deserted her
i know that the great volcano at washington
aroused and directed by the evil spirit that reigns there
is belching forth the lava of political corruption in a current broad and deep
which is sweeping with frightful velocity over the whole length and breadth of the land
bidding fair to leave unscathed no green spot or living thing while on its bosom are riding
like demons on the waves of hell
the imps of that evil spirit
and fiendishly taunting all those who dare resist its destroying course with the hopelessness of their effort and
knowing this
i cannot deny that all may be swept away
broken by it i
may be bow to it i never will
the probability that we may fall in the struggle ought not to deter us from the support of a cause we believe to be just it shall not deter me
if ever i feel the soul within me elevate and expand to those dimensions not wholly unworthy of its almighty architect
it is when i contemplate the cause of my country deserted by all the world beside

and hurling defiance at her victorious oppressors

dear stuart
henry will write you all the political news
i write this about some little matters of business
you recollect you told me you had drawn the chicago masark money
and sent it to the claimants
a hawk billed yankee is here besetting me at every turn i take
saying that robert kinzie never received the eighty dollars to which he was entitled
can you tell me anything about the matter
old mr
who lives up south fork somewhere
is teasing me continually about some deeds which he says he left with you
but which i can find nothing of
can you tell me where they are
the legislature is in session and has suffered the bank to forfeit its charter without benefit of clergy
there seems to be little disposition to resuscitate it
whenever a letter comes from you to mrs
i carry it to her
and then i see betty she is a tolerable nice fellow now
maybe i will write again when i get more time

1840 circular from whig committee
january 1
to messrs gentlemen
in obedience to a resolution of the whig state convention
we have appointed you the central whig committee of your county
the trust confided to you will be one of watchfulness and labor but we hope the glory of having contributed to the overthrow of the corrupt powers that now control our beloved country will be a sufficient reward for the time and labor you will devote to it
our whig brethren throughout the union have met in convention
and after due deliberation and mutual concessions have elected candidates for the presidency and vice presidency not only worthy of our cause
but worthy of the support of every true patriot who would have our country redeemed
and her institutions honestly and faithfully administered
to overthrow the trained bands that are opposed to us whose salaried officers are ever on the watch
and whose misguided followers are ever ready to obey their smallest commands
every whig must not only know his duty
but must firmly resolve
whatever of time and labor it may cost
boldly and faithfully to do it
our intention is to organize the whole state
so that every whig can be brought to the polls in the coming presidential contest
we cannot do this
without your co operation and as we do our duty
so we shall expect you to do yours
after due deliberation
the following is the plan of organization
and the duties required of each county committee
1 to divide their county into small districts
and to appoint in each a subcommittee
whose duty it shall be to make a perfect list of all the voters in their respective districts
and to ascertain with certainty for whom they will vote
if they meet with men who are doubtful as to the man they will support
such voters should be designated in separate lines
with the name of the man they will probably support
2 it will be the duty of said subcommittee to keep a constant watch on the doubtful voters
and from time to time have them talked to by those in whom they have the most confidence
and also to place in their hands such documents as will enlighten and influence them
3 it will also be their duty to report to you
at least once a month
the progress they are making
and on election days see that every whig is brought to the polls
4 the subcommittees should be appointed immediately and by the last of april
at least
they should make their first report
5 on the first of each month hereafter we shall expect to hear from you
after the first report of your subcommittees
unless there should be found a great many doubtful voters
you can tell pretty accurately the manner in which your county will vote
in each of your letters to us
you will state the number of certain votes both for and against us
as well as the number of doubtful votes
with your opinion of the manner in which they will be cast
6 when we have heard from all the counties
we shall be able to tell with similar accuracy the political complexion of the state
this information will be forwarded to you as soon as received
7 inclosed is a prospectus for a newspaper to be continued until after the presidential election
it will be superintended by ourselves
and every whig in the state must take it
it will be published so low that every one can afford it
you must raise a fund and forward us for extra copies
every county ought to send fifty or one hundred dollars
and the copies will be forwarded to you for distribution among our political opponents
the paper will be devoted exclusively to the great cause in which we are engaged
procure subscriptions
and forward them to us immediately
8 immediately after any election in your county
you must inform us of its results and as early as possible after any general election we will give you the like information
9 a senator in congress is to be elected by our next legislature
let no local interests divide you
but select candidates that can succeed
10 our plan of operations will of course be concealed from every one except our good friends who of right ought to know them
trusting much in our good cause
the strength of our candidates
and the determination of the whigs everywhere to do their duty
we go to the work of organization in this state confident of success
we have the numbers
and if properly organized and exerted
with the gallant harrison at our head
we shall meet our foes and conquer them in all parts of the union
address your letters to dr
barrett a

1840 dear stuart
i have never seen the prospects of our party so bright in these parts as they are now
we shall carry this county by a larger majority than we did in 1836
when you ran against may
i do not think my prospects
are very flattering
for i think it probable i shall not be permitted to be a candidate but the party ticket will succeed triumphantly
subscriptions to the old soldier pour in without abatement
this morning i took from the post office a letter from dubois enclosing the names of sixty subscribers
and on carrying it to francis i found he had received one hundred and forty more from other quarters by the same day's mail
that is but an average specimen of every day's receipts
yesterday douglas
having chosen to consider himself insulted by something in the journal
undertook to cane francis in the street
francis caught him by the hair and jammed him back against a market cart where the matter ended by francis being pulled away from him
the whole affair was so ludicrous that francis and everybody else douglass excepted have been laughing about it ever since
i send you the names of some of the v
men who have come out for harrison about town
and suggest that you send them some documents
moses coffman he let us appoint him a delegate yesterday
aaron coffman
george gregory
johnson at birchall's bookstore
michael glyn
armstrong not hosea nor hugh
but a carpenter
thomas hunter
moses pileher he was always a whig and deserves attention
matthew crowder jr
greenberry smith john fagan
george fagan
william fagan these three fell out with us about early
and are doubtful now
john m
noah rickard

the foregoing should be addressed at springfield
also send some to solomon miller and john auth at salisbury
also to charles harper

john scroggins at pulaski
logan county
speed says he wrote you what jo smith said about you as he passed here
we will procure the names of some of his people here
and send them to you before long
speed also says you must not fail to send us the new york journal he wrote for some time since
evan butler is jealous that you never send your compliments to him
you must not neglect him next time

lincoln resolution in the illinois legislature

in the illinois house of representatives
november 28
lincoln offered the following
that so much of the governor's message as relates to fraudulent voting
and other fraudulent practices at elections
be referred to the committee on elections
with instructions to said committee to prepare and report to the house a bill for such an act as may in their judgment afford the greatest possible protection of the elective franchise against all frauds of all sorts whatever

december 4
on presentation of a report respecting petition of h
claiming the seat of mr
phelps from peoria
lincoln moved that the house resolve itself into committee of the whole on the question
and take it up immediately
lincoln considered the question of the highest importance whether an individual had a right to sit in this house or not
the course he should propose would be to take up the evidence and decide upon the facts seriatim
drummond wanted time they could not decide in the heat of debate
lincoln thought that the question had better be gone into now
in courts of law jurors were required to decide on evidence
without previous study or examination
they were required to know nothing of the subject until the evidence was laid before them for their immediate decision
he thought that the heat of party would be augmented by delay
the speaker called mr
lincoln to order as being irrelevant no mention had been made of party heat
drummond said he had only spoken of debate
lincoln asked what caused the heat
if it was not party
lincoln concluded by urging that the question would be decided now better than hereafter
and he thought with less heat and excitement

house in committee of the whole on the bill providing for payment of interest on the state debt
lincoln moved to strike out the body and amendments of the bill
and insert in lieu thereof an amendment which in substance was that the governor be authorized to issue bonds for the payment of the interest that these be called interest bonds that the taxes accruing on congress lands as they become taxable be irrevocably set aside and devoted as a fund to the payment of the interest bonds
lincoln went into the reasons which appeared to him to render this plan preferable to that of hypothecating the state bonds
by this course we could get along till the next meeting of the legislature
which was of great importance
to the objection which might be urged that these interest bonds could not be cashed
he replied that if our other bonds could
much more could these
which offered a perfect security
a fund being irrevocably set aside to provide for their redemption
to another objection
that we should be paying compound interest
he would reply that the rapid growth and increase of our resources was in so great a ratio as to outstrip the difficulty that his object was to do the best that could be done in the present emergency
all agreed that the faith of the state must be preserved this plan appeared to him preferable to a hypothecation of bonds
which would have to be redeemed and the interest paid
how this was to be done
he could not see therefore he had
after turning the matter over in every way
devised this measure
which would carry us on till the next legislature
lincoln spoke at some length
advocating his measure
lincoln advocated his measure

he had thought some permanent provision ought to be made for the bonds to be hypothecated

i am now the most miserable man living
if what i feel were equally distributed to the whole human family
there would not be one cheerful face on earth
whether i shall ever be better
i cannot tell i awfully forbode i shall not
to remain as i am is impossible

i fear i shall be unable to attend any business here

remarks in the illinois legislature
january 23
1841 in the house of representatives january 23
while discussing the continuation of the illinois and michigan canal
moore was afraid the holders of the scrip would lose
napier thought there was no danger of that and mr
lincoln said he had not examined to see what amount of scrip would probably be needed
the principal point in his mind was this
that nobody was obliged to take these certificates
it is altogether voluntary on their part
and if they apprehend it will fall in their hands they will not take it
further the loss
if any there be
will fall on the citizens of that section of the country
this scrip is not going to circulate over an extensive range of country
but will be confined chiefly to the vicinity of the canal
we find the representatives of that section of the country are all in favor of the bill
when we propose to protect their interests
they say to us
leave us to take care of ourselves we are willing to run the risk
and this is reasonable we must suppose they are competent to protect their own interests
and it is only fair to let them do it
circular from whig committee
february 9
appeal to the people of the state of illinois
when the general assembly
now about adjourning
assembled in november last
from the bankrupt state of the public treasury
the pecuniary embarrassments prevailing in every department of society
the dilapidated state of the public works
and the impending danger of the degradation of the state
you had a right to expect that your representatives would lose no time in devising and adopting measures to avert threatened calamities
alleviate the distresses of the people
and allay the fearful apprehensions in regard to the future prosperity of the state
it was not expected by you that the spirit of party would take the lead in the councils of the state
and make every interest bend to its demands
nor was it expected that any party would assume to itself the entire control of legislation
and convert the means and offices of the state
and the substance of the people
into aliment for party subsistence
neither could it have been expected by you that party spirit
however strong its desires and unreasonable its demands
would have passed the sanctuary of the constitution
and entered with its unhallowed and hideous form into the formation of the judiciary system
at the early period of the session
measures were adopted by the dominant party to take possession of the state
to fill all public offices with party men
and make every measure affecting the interests of the people and the credit of the state operate in furtherance of their party views
the merits of men and measures therefore became the subject of discussion in caucus
instead of the halls of legislation
and decisions there made by a minority of the legislature have been executed and carried into effect by the force of party discipline
without any regard whatever to the rights of the people or the interests of the state
the supreme court of the state was organized
and judges appointed
according to the provisions of the constitution
in 1824
the people have never complained of the organization of that court no attempt has ever before been made to change that department
respect for public opinion
and regard for the rights and liberties of the people
have hitherto restrained the spirit of party from attacks upon the independence and integrity of the judiciary
the same judges have continued in office since 1824 their decisions have not been the subject of complaint among the people the integrity and honesty of the court have not been questioned
and it has never been supposed that the court has ever permitted party prejudice or party considerations to operate upon their decisions
the court was made to consist of four judges
and by the constitution two form a quorum for the transaction of business
with this tribunal
thus constituted
the people have been satisfied for near sixteen years
the same law which organized the supreme court in 1824 also established and organized circuit courts to be held in each county in the state
and five circuit judges were appointed to hold those courts
in 1826 the legislature abolished these circuit courts
repealed the judges out of office
and required the judges of the supreme court to hold the circuit courts
the reasons assigned for this change were
that the business of the country could be better attended to by the four judges of the supreme court than by the two sets of judges and
the state of the public treasury forbade the employment of unnecessary officers
in 1828 a circuit was established north of the illinois river
in order to meet the wants of the people
and a circuit judge was appointed to hold the courts in that circuit
in 1834 the circuit court system was again established throughout the state
circuit judges appointed to hold the courts
and the judges of the supreme court were relieved from the performance of circuit court duties
the change was recommended by the then acting governor of the state
general w
in the following terms
the augmented population of the state
the multiplied number of organized counties
as well as the increase of business in all
has long since convinced every one conversant with this department of our government of the indispensable necessity of an alteration in our judiciary system
and the subject is therefore recommended to the earnest patriotic consideration of the legislature
the present system has never been exempt from serious and weighty objections
the idea of appealing from the circuit court to the same judges in the supreme court is recommended by little hopes of redress to the injured party below
the duties of the circuit
it may be added
consume one half of the year
leaving a small and inadequate portion of time when that required for domestic purposes is deducted to erect
in the decisions of the supreme court
a judicial monument of legal learning and research
which the talent and ability of the court might otherwise be entirely competent to
with this organization of circuit courts the people have never complained
the only complaints which we have heard have come from circuits which were so large that the judges could not dispose of the business
and the circuits in which judges pearson and ralston lately presided
whilst the honor and credit of the state demanded legislation upon the subject of the public debt
the canal
the unfinished public works
and the embarrassments of the people
the judiciary stood upon a basis which required no change no legislative action
yet the party in power
neglecting every interest requiring legislative action
and wholly disregarding the rights
and interests of the people
for the unholy purpose of providing places for its partisans and supplying them with large salaries
disorganized that department of the government
provision is made for the election of five party judges of the supreme court
the proscription of four circuit judges
and the appointment of party clerks in more than half the counties of the state
men professing respect for public opinion
and acknowledged to be leaders of the party
have avowed in the halls of legislation that the change in the judiciary was intended to produce political results favorable to their party and party friends
the immutable principles of justice are to make way for party interests
and the bonds of social order are to be rent in twain
in order that a desperate faction may be sustained at the expense of the people
the change proposed in the judiciary was supported upon grounds so destructive to the institutions of the country
and so entirely at war with the rights and liberties of the people
that the party could not secure entire unanimity in its support
three democrats of the senate and five of the house voting against the measure
they were unwilling to see the temples of justice and the seats of independent judges occupied by the tools of faction
the declarations of the party leaders
the selection of party men for judges
and the total disregard for the public will in the adoption of the measure
prove conclusively that the object has been not reform
but destruction not the advancement of the highest interests of the state
but the predominance of party
we cannot in this manner undertake to point out all the objections to this party measure we present you with those stated by the council of revision upon returning the bill
and we ask for them a candid consideration
believing that the independence of the judiciary has been destroyed
that hereafter our courts will be independent of the people
and entirely dependent upon the legislature that our rights of property and liberty of conscience can no longer be regarded as safe from the encroachments of unconstitutional legislation and knowing of no other remedy which can be adopted consistently with the peace and good order of society
we call upon you to avail yourselves of the opportunity afforded
at the next general election
vote for a convention of the people
committee on behalf of the whig members of the legislature
against the reorganization of the judiciary
extract from a protest in the illinois legislature february 26
1841 for the reasons thus presented
and for others no less apparent
the undersigned cannot assent to the passage of the bill
or permit it to become a law
without this evidence of their disapprobation and they now protest against the reorganization of the judiciary
because 1 it violates the great principles of free government by subjecting the judiciary to the legislature
2 it is a fatal blow at the independence of the judges and the constitutional term of their office
3 it is a measure not asked for
or wished for
by the people
4 it will greatly increase the expense of our courts
or else greatly diminish their utility
5 it will give our courts a political and partisan character
thereby impairing public confidence in their decisions
6 it will impair our standing with other states and the world
7 it is a party measure for party purposes
from which no practical good to the people can possibly arise
but which may be the source of immeasurable evils
the undersigned are well aware that this protest will be altogether unavailing with the majority of this body
the blow has already fallen
and we are compelled to stand by
the mournful spectators of the ruin it will cause

speed murder case springfield june 19
dear speed
we have had the highest state of excitement here for a week past that our community has ever witnessed and
although the public feeling is somewhat allayed
the curious affair which aroused it is very far from being even yet cleared of mystery
it would take a quire of paper to give you anything like a full account of it
and i therefore only propose a brief outline
the chief personages in the drama are archibald fisher
supposed to be murdered
and archibald trailor
henry trailor
and william trailor
supposed to have murdered him
the three trailors are brothers
the first
as you know
lives in town the second
in clary's grove and the third
in warren county and fisher
the supposed murdered
being without a family
had made his home with william
on saturday evening
being the 29th of may
fisher and william came to henry's in a one horse dearborn
and there stayed over sunday and on monday all three came to springfield henry on horseback and joined archibald at myers's
the dutch carpenter
that evening at supper fisher was missing
and so next morning some ineffectual search was made for him and on tuesday
at one o'clock p
william and henry started home without him
in a day or two henry and one or two of his clary grove neighbors came back for him again
and advertised his disappearance in the papers
the knowledge of the matter thus far had not been general
and here it dropped entirely
till about the 10th instant
when keys received a letter from the postmaster in warren county
that william had arrived at home
and was telling a very mysterious and improbable story about the disappearance of fisher
which induced the community there to suppose he had been disposed of unfairly
keys made this letter public
which immediately set the whole town and adjoining county agog
and so it has continued until yesterday
the mass of the people commenced a systematic search for the dead body
while wickersham was despatched to arrest henry trailor at the grove
and jim maxcy to warren to arrest william
on monday last
henry was brought in
and showed an evident inclination to insinuate that he knew fisher to be dead
and that arch
and william had killed him
he said he guessed the body could be found in spring creek
between the beardstown road and hickox's mill
away the people swept like a herd of buffalo
and cut down hickox's mill dam nolens volens
to draw the water out of the pond
and then went up and down and down and up the creek
fishing and raking
and raking and ducking and diving for two days
after all
no dead body found
in the meantime a sort of scuffling ground had been found in the brush in the angle
or point
where the road leading into the woods past the brewery and the one leading in past the brick yard meet
from the scuffle ground was the sign of something about the size of a man having been dragged to the edge of the thicket
where it joined the track of some small wheeled carriage drawn by one horse
as shown by the road tracks
the carriage track led off toward spring creek
near this drag trail dr
merryman found two hairs
after a long scientific examination
he pronounced to be triangular human hairs
which term
he says
includes within it the whiskers
the hair growing under the arms and on other parts of the body and he judged that these two were of the whiskers
because the ends were cut
showing that they had flourished in the neighborhood of the razor's operations
on thursday last jim maxcy brought in william trailor from warren
on the same day arch
was arrested and put in jail
yesterday friday william was put upon his examining trial before may and lovely
archibald and henry were both present
lamborn prosecuted
and logan
and your humble servant defended
a great many witnesses were introduced and examined
but i shall only mention those whose testimony seemed most important
the first of these was captain ransdell
he swore that when william and henry left springfield for home on tuesday before mentioned they did not take the direct route
you know
leads by the butcher shop
but that they followed the street north until they got opposite
or nearly opposite
may's new house
after which he could not see them from where he stood and it was afterwards proved that in about an hour after they started
they came into the street by the butcher shop from toward the brickyard
merryman and others swore to what is stated about the scuffle ground
and carriage tracks
henry was then introduced by the prosecution
he swore that when they started for home they went out north
as ransdell stated
and turned down west by the brick yard into the woods
and there met archibald that they proceeded a small distance farther
when he was placed as a sentinel to watch for and announce the approach of any one that might happen that way that william and arch
took the dearborn out of the road a small distance to the edge of the thicket
where they stopped
and he saw them lift the body of a man into it that they then moved off with the carriage in the direction of hickox's mill
and he loitered about for something like an hour
when william returned with the carriage
but without arch
and said they had put him in a safe place that they went somehow he did not know exactly how into the road close to the brewery
and proceeded on to clary's grove
he also stated that some time during the day william told him that he and arch
had killed fisher the evening before that the way they did it was by him william knocking him down with a club
and arch
then choking him to death
an old man from warren
called dr
was then introduced on the part of the defense
he swore that he had known fisher for several years that fisher had resided at his house a long time at each of two different spells once while he built a barn for him
and once while he was doctored for some chronic disease that two or three years ago fisher had a serious hurt in his head by the bursting of a gun
since which he had been subject to continued bad health and occasional aberration of mind
he also stated that on last tuesday
being the same day that maxcy arrested william trailor
he the doctor was from home in the early part of the day
and on his return
about eleven o'clock
found fisher at his house in bed
and apparently very unwell that he asked him how he came from springfield that fisher said he had come by peoria
and also told of several other places he had been at more in the direction of peoria
which showed that he at the time of speaking did not know where he had been wandering about in a state of derangement
he further stated that in about two hours he received a note from one of trailor's friends
advising him of his arrest
and requesting him to go on to springfield as a witness
to testify as to the state of fisher's health in former times that he immediately set off
calling up two of his neighbors as company
riding all evening and all night
overtook maxcy and william at lewiston in fulton county that maxcy refusing to discharge trailor upon his statement
his two neighbors returned and he came on to springfield
some question being made as to whether the doctor's story was not a fabrication
several acquaintances of his among whom was the same postmaster who wrote keys
as before mentioned were introduced as sort of compurgators
who swore that they knew the doctor to be of good character for truth and veracity
and generally of good character in every way
here the testimony ended
and the trailors were discharged
and william expressing both in word and manner their entire confidence that fisher would be found alive at the doctor's by galloway
and myers
who a day before had been despatched for that purpose which henry still protested that no power on earth could ever show fisher alive
thus stands this curious affair
when the doctor's story was first made public
it was amusing to scan and contemplate the countenances and hear the remarks of those who had been actively in search for the dead body
some looked quizzical
some melancholy
and some furiously angry
who had been very active
swore he always knew the man was not dead
and that he had not stirred an inch to hunt for him langford
who had taken the lead in cutting down hickox's mill dam
and wanted to hang hickox for objecting
looked most awfully woebegone
he seemed the victim of unrequited affection
as represented in the comic almanacs we used to laugh over and hart
the little drayman that hauled molly home once
said it was too damned bad to have so much trouble
and no hanging after all
i commenced this letter on yesterday
since which i received yours of the 13th
i stick to my promise to come to louisville
nothing new here except what i have written
i have not seen since my last trip
and i am going out there as soon as i mail this letter
yours forever
statement about harry wilton
june 25
1841 it having been charged in some of the public prints that harry wilton
late united states marshal for the district of illinois
had used his office for political effect
in the appointment of deputies for the taking of the census for the year 1840
the undersigned
were called upon by mr
wilton to examine the papers in his possession relative to these appointments
and to ascertain therefrom the correctness or incorrectness of such charge
we accompanied mr
wilton to a room
and examined the matter as fully as we could with the means afforded us
the only sources of information bearing on the subject which were submitted to us were the letters
recommending and opposing the various appointments made
and mr
wilton's verbal statements concerning the same
from these letters
it appears that in some instances appointments were made in accordance with the recommendations of leading whigs
and in opposition to those of leading democrats among which instances the appointments at scott
and lawrence are the strongest
according to mr
wilton's statement of the seventy six appointments we examined
fifty four were of democrats
eleven of whigs
and eleven of unknown politics
the chief ground of complaint against mr
as we had understood it
was because of his appointment of so many democratic candidates for the legislature
thus giving them a decided advantage over their whig opponents and consequently our attention was directed rather particularly to that point
we found that there were many such appointments
among which were those in tazewell
and we did not learn that there was one instance in which a whig candidate for the legislature had been appointed
there was no written evidence before us showing us at what time those appointments were made but mr
wilton stated that they all with one exception were made before those appointed became candidates for the legislature
and the letters
recommending them all bear date before
and most of them long before
those appointed were publicly announced candidates
we give the foregoing naked facts and draw no conclusions from them

my friend
by the way
a fine example was presented on board the boat for contemplating the effect of condition upon human happiness
a gentleman had purchased twelve negroes in different parts of kentucky
and was taking them to a farm in the south
they were chained six and six together
a small iron clevis was around the left wrist of each
and this fastened to the main chain by a shorter one
at a convenient distance from the others
so that the negroes were strung together precisely like so many fish upon a trotline
in this condition they were being separated forever from the scenes of their childhood
their friends
their fathers and mothers
and brothers and sisters
and many of them from their wives and children
and going into perpetual slavery where the lash of the master is proverbially more ruthless and unrelenting than any other and yet amid all these distressing circumstances
as we would think them
they were the most cheerful and apparently happy creatures on board
whose offence for which he had been sold was an overfondness for his wife
played the fiddle almost continually
and the others danced
cracked jokes
and played various games with cards from day to day
how true it is that 'god tempers the wind to the shorn lamb
 or in other words
that he renders the worst of human conditions tolerable
while he permits the best to be nothing better than tolerable
to return to the narrative
when we reached springfield i stayed but one day
when i started on this tedious circuit where i now am
do you remember my going to the city
while i was in kentucky
to have a tooth extracted
and making a failure of it
that same old tooth got to paining me so much that about a week since i had it torn out
bringing with it a bit of the jawbone
the consequence of which is that my mouth is now so sore that i can neither talk nor eat
your sincere friend
1842 to joshua f
speed on marriage january 30
my dear speed
as you know i do
the deepest solicitude for the success of the enterprise you are engaged in
i adopt this as the last method i can adopt to aid you
in case which god forbid
you shall need any aid
i do not place what i am going to say on paper because i can say it better that way than i could by word of mouth
were i to say it orally before we part
most likely you would forget it at the very time when it might do you some good
as i think it reasonable that you will feel very badly some time between this and the final consummation of your purpose
it is intended that you shall read this just at such a time
why i say it is reasonable that you will feel very badly yet
is because of three special causes added to the general one which i shall mention
the general cause is
that you are naturally of a nervous temperament and this i say from what i have seen of you personally
and what you have told me concerning your mother at various times
and concerning your brother william at the time his wife died
the first special cause is your exposure to bad weather on your journey
which my experience clearly proves to be very severe on defective nerves
the second is the absence of all business and conversation of friends
which might divert your mind
give it occasional rest from the intensity of thought which will sometimes wear the sweetest idea threadbare and turn it to the bitterness of death
the third is the rapid and near approach of that crisis on which all your thoughts and feelings concentrate
if from all these causes you shall escape and go through triumphantly
without another twinge of the soul
i shall be most happily but most egregiously deceived
on the contrary
you shall
as i expect you will at sometime
be agonized and distressed
let me
who have some reason to speak with judgment on such a subject
beseech you to ascribe it to the causes i have mentioned
and not to some false and ruinous suggestion of the devil
you will say
do not your causes apply to every one engaged in a like undertaking
by no means
the particular causes
to a greater or less extent
perhaps do apply in all cases but the general one
nervous debility
which is the key and conductor of all the particular ones
and without which they would be utterly harmless
though it does pertain to you
does not pertain to one in a thousand
it is out of this that the painful difference between you and the mass of the world springs
i know what the painful point with you is at all times when you are unhappy it is an apprehension that you do not love her as you should
what nonsense
how came you to court her
was it because you thought she deserved it
and that you had given her reason to expect it
if it was for that why did not the same reason make you court ann todd
and at least twenty others of whom you can think
and to whom it would apply with greater force than to her
did you court her for her wealth
you know she had none
but you say you reasoned yourself into it
what do you mean by that
was it not that you found yourself unable to reason yourself out of it
did you not think
and partly form the purpose
of courting her the first time you ever saw her or heard of her
what had reason to do with it at that early stage
there was nothing at that time for reason to work upon
whether she was moral
or even of good character
you did not
nor could then know
you might infer the last from the company you found her in
all you then did or could know of her was her personal appearance and deportment and these
if they impress at all
impress the heart
and not the head
say candidly
were not those heavenly black eyes the whole basis of all your early reasoning on the subject
after you and i had once been at the residence
did you not go and take me all the way to lexington and back
for no other purpose but to get to see her again
on our return on that evening to take a trip for that express object
what earthly consideration would you take to find her scouting and despising you
and giving herself up to another
but of this you have no apprehension and therefore you cannot bring it home to your feelings
i shall be so anxious about you that i shall want you to write by every mail
your friend
to joshua f
february 3
dear speed
your letter of the 25th january came to hand to day
you well know that i do not feel my own sorrows much more keenly than i do yours
when i know of them and yet i assure you i was not much hurt by what you wrote me of your excessively bad feeling at the time you wrote
not that i am less capable of sympathizing with you now than ever
not that i am less your friend than ever
but because i hope and believe that your present anxiety and distress about her health and her life must and will forever banish those horrid doubts which i know you sometimes felt as to the truth of your affection for her
if they can once and forever be removed and i almost feel a presentiment that the almighty has sent your present affliction expressly for that object
surely nothing can come in their stead to fill their immeasurable measure of misery
the death scenes of those we love are surely painful enough but these we are prepared for and expect to see
they happen to all
and all know they must happen
painful as they are
they are not an unlooked for sorrow
should she
as you fear
be destined to an early grave
it is indeed a great consolation to know that she is so well prepared to meet it
her religion
which you once disliked so much
i will venture you now prize most highly
but i hope your melancholy bodings as to her early death are not well founded
i even hope that ere this reaches you she will have returned with improved and still improving health
and that you will have met her
and forgotten the sorrows of the past in the enjoyments of the present
i would say more if i could
but it seems that i have said enough
it really appears to me that you yourself ought to rejoice
and not sorrow
at this indubitable evidence of your undying affection for her
if you did not love her although you might not wish her death
you would most certainly be resigned to it
perhaps this point is no longer a question with you
and my pertinacious dwelling upon it is a rude intrusion upon your feelings
if so
you must pardon me
you know the hell i have suffered on that point
and how tender i am upon it
you know i do not mean wrong
i have been quite clear of hypo since you left
even better than i was along in the fall
i have seen but once
she seemed very cheerful
and so i said nothing to her about what we spoke of
old uncle billy herndon is dead
and it is said this evening that uncle ben ferguson will not live
i believe
is all the news
and enough at that unless it were better
write me immediately on the receipt of this
your friend
as ever

february 13
dear speed
yours of the 1st instant came to hand three or four days ago
when this shall reach you
you will have been fanny's husband several days
you know my desire to befriend you is everlasting that i will never cease while i know how to do anything
but you will always hereafter be on ground that i have never occupied
and consequently
if advice were needed
i might advise wrong
i do fondly hope
that you will never again need any comfort from abroad
but should i be mistaken in this
should excessive pleasure still be accompanied with a painful counterpart at times
still let me urge you
as i have ever done
to remember
in the depth and even agony of despondency
that very shortly you are to feel well again
i am now fully convinced that you love her as ardently as you are capable of loving
your ever being happy in her presence
and your intense anxiety about her health
if there were nothing else
would place this beyond all dispute in my mind
i incline to think it probable that your nerves will fail you occasionally for a while but once you get them firmly guarded now that trouble is over forever
i think
if i were you
in case my mind were not exactly right
i would avoid being idle
i would immediately engage in some business
or go to making preparations for it
which would be the same thing
if you went through the ceremony calmly
or even with sufficient composure not to excite alarm in any present
you are safe beyond question
and in two or three months
to say the most
will be the happiest of men
i would desire you to give my particular respects to fanny but perhaps you will not wish her to know you have received this
lest she should desire to see it
make her write me an answer to my last letter to her at any rate i would set great value upon a note or letter from her
write me whenever you have leisure
yours forever
i have been quite a man since you left
to g
yours of the 10th is duly received
judge logan and myself are doing business together now
and we are willing to attend to your cases as you propose
as to the terms
we are willing to attend each case you prepare and send us for 10 when there shall be no opposition to be sent in advance
or you to know that it is safe
it takes 5
75 of cost to start upon
that is
75 to clerk
and 2 to each of two publishers of papers
judge logan thinks it will take the balance of 20 to carry a case through
this must be advanced from time to time as the services are performed
as the officers will not act without
i do not know whether you can be admitted an attorney of the federal court in your absence or not nor is it material
as the business can be done in our names
thinking it may aid you a little
i send you one of our blank forms of petitions
you will see
is framed to be sworn to before the federal court clerk
in your cases
will have to be so far changed as to be sworn to before the clerk of your circuit court and his certificate must be accompanied with his official seal
the schedules
must be attended to
be sure that they contain the creditors' names
their residences
the amounts due each
the debtors' names
their residences
and the amounts they owe
also all property and where located
also be sure that the schedules are all signed by the applicants as well as the petition
publication will have to be made here in one paper
and in one nearest the residence of the applicant
write us in each case where the last advertisement is to be sent
whether to you or to what paper
i believe i have now said everything that can be of any advantage
your friend as ever
to george e
pickett advice to youth february 22
i never encourage deceit
and falsehood
especially if you have got a bad memory
is the worst enemy a fellow can have
the fact is truth is your truest friend
no matter what the circumstances are
notwithstanding this copy book preamble
my boy
i am inclined to suggest a little prudence on your part
you see i have a congenital aversion to failure
and the sudden announcement to your uncle andrew of the success of your lamp rubbing might possibly prevent your passing the severe physical examination to which you will be subjected in order to enter the military academy
you see i should like to have a perfect soldier credited to dear old illinois no broken bones
scalp wounds
so i think it might be wise to hand this letter from me in to your good uncle through his room window after he has had a comfortable dinner
and watch its effect from the top of the pigeon house
i have just told the folks here in springfield on this 111th anniversary of the birth of him whose name
mightiest in the cause of civil liberty
still mightiest in the cause of moral reformation
we mention in solemn awe
in naked
deathless splendor
that the one victory we can ever call complete will be that one which proclaims that there is not one slave or one drunkard on the face of god's green earth
recruit for this victory
on your march
don't you go and forget the old maxim that one drop of honey catches more flies than a half gallon of gall
load your musket with this maxim
and smoke it in your pipe
address before the springfield washingtonian temperance society
february 22
although the temperance cause has been in progress for near twenty years
it is apparent to all that it is just now being crowned with a degree of success hitherto unparalleled
the list of its friends is daily swelled by the additions of fifties
of hundreds
and of thousands
the cause itself seems suddenly transformed from a cold abstract theory to a living
and powerful chieftain
going forth conquering and to conquer
the citadels of his great adversary are daily being stormed and dismantled his temple and his altars
where the rites of his idolatrous worship have long been performed
and where human sacrifices have long been wont to be made
are daily desecrated and deserted
the triumph of the conqueror's fame is sounding from hill to hill
from sea to sea
and from land to land
and calling millions to his standard at a blast
for this new and splendid success we heartily rejoice
that that success is so much greater now than heretofore is doubtless owing to rational causes and if we would have it continue
we shall do well to inquire what those causes are
the warfare heretofore waged against the demon intemperance has somehow or other been erroneous
either the champions engaged or the tactics they adopted have not been the most proper
these champions for the most part have been preachers
and hired agents
between these and the mass of mankind there is a want of approachability
if the term be admissible
at least
fatal to their success
they are supposed to have no sympathy of feeling or interest with those very persons whom it is their object to convince and persuade
and again
it is so common and so easy to ascribe motives to men of these classes other than those they profess to act upon
the preacher
it is said
advocates temperance because he is a fanatic
and desires a union of the church and state the lawyer from his pride and vanity of hearing himself speak and the hired agent for his salary
but when one who has long been known as a victim of intemperance bursts the fetters that have bound him
and appears before his neighbors clothed and in his right mind
a redeemed specimen of long lost humanity
and stands up
with tears of joy trembling in his eyes
to tell of the miseries once endured
now to be endured no more forever of his once naked and starving children
now clad and fed comfortably of a wife long weighed down with woe
and a broken heart
now restored to health
and a renewed affection and how easily it is all done
once it is resolved to be done how simple his language
there is a logic and an eloquence in it that few with human feelings can resist
they cannot say that he desires a union of church and state
for he is not a church member they cannot say he is vain of hearing himself speak
for his whole demeanor shows he would gladly avoid speaking at all they cannot say he speaks for pay
for he receives none
and asks for none
nor can his sincerity in any way be doubted
or his sympathy for those he would persuade to imitate his example be denied
in my judgment
it is to the battles of this new class of champions that our late success is greatly
perhaps chiefly
had the old school champions themselves been of the most wise selecting
was their system of tactics the most judicious
it seems to me it was not
too much denunciation against dram sellers and dram drinkers was indulged in
this i think was both impolitic and unjust
it was impolitic
because it is not much in the nature of man to be driven to anything still less to be driven about that which is exclusively his own business and least of all where such driving is to be submitted to at the expense of pecuniary interest or burning appetite
when the dram seller and drinker were incessantly told not in accents of entreaty and persuasion
diffidently addressed by erring man to an erring brother
but in the thundering tones of anathema and denunciation with which the lordly judge often groups together all the crimes of the felon's life
and thrusts them in his face just ere he passes sentence of death upon him that they were the authors of all the vice and misery and crime in the land that they were the manufacturers and material of all the thieves and robbers and murderers that infest the earth that their houses were the workshops of the devil and that their persons should be shunned by all the good and virtuous
as moral pestilences i say
when they were told all this
and in this way
it is not wonderful that they were slow to acknowledge the truth of such denunciations
and to join the ranks of their denouncers in a hue and cry against themselves
to have expected them to do otherwise than they did to have expected them not to meet denunciation with denunciation
crimination with crimination
and anathema with anathema was to expect a reversal of human nature
which is god's decree and can never be reversed
when the conduct of men is designed to be influenced
unassuming persuasion
should ever be adopted
it is an old and a true maxim that a drop of honey catches more flies than a gallon of gall
so with men
if you would win a man to your cause
first convince him that you are his sincere friend
therein is a drop of honey that catches his heart
say what he will
is the great highroad to his reason and which
when once gained
you will find but little trouble in convincing his judgment of the justice of your cause
if indeed that cause really be a just one
on the contrary
assume to dictate to his judgment
or to command his action
or to mark him as one to be shunned and despised
and he will retreat within himself
close all the avenues to his head and his heart and though your cause be naked truth itself
transformed to the heaviest lance
harder than steel
and sharper than steel can be made
and though you throw it with more than herculean force and precision
you shall be no more able to pierce him than to penetrate the hard shell of a tortoise with a rye straw
such is man
and so must he be understood by those who would lead him
even to his own best interests
on this point the washingtonians greatly excel the temperance advocates of former times
those whom they desire to convince and persuade are their old friends and companions
they know they are not demons
nor even the worst of men they know that generally they are kind
and charitable even beyond the example of their more staid and sober neighbors
they are practical philanthropists and they glow with a generous and brotherly zeal that mere theorizers are incapable of feeling
benevolence and charity possess their hearts entirely and out of the abundance of their hearts their tongues give utterance love through all their actions runs
and all their words are mild
in this spirit they speak and act
and in the same they are heard and regarded
and when such is the temper of the advocate
and such of the audience
no good cause can be unsuccessful
but i have said that denunciations against dramsellers and dram drinkers are unjust
as well as impolitic
let us see
i have not inquired at what period of time the use of intoxicating liquors commenced nor is it important to know
it is sufficient that
to all of us who now inhabit the world
the practice of drinking them is just as old as the world itself that is
we have seen the one just as long as we have seen the other
when all such of us as have now reached the years of maturity first opened our eyes upon the stage of existence
we found intoxicating liquor recognized by everybody
used by everybody
repudiated by nobody
it commonly entered into the first draught of the infant and the last draught of the dying man
from the sideboard of the parson down to the ragged pocket of the houseless loafer
it was constantly found
physicians proscribed it in this
and the other disease government provided it for soldiers and sailors and to have a rolling or raising
a husking or hoedown
anywhere about without it was positively insufferable
it was everywhere a respectable article of manufacture and merchandise
the making of it was regarded as an honorable livelihood
and he who could make most was the most enterprising and respectable
large and small manufactories of it were everywhere erected
in which all the earthly goods of their owners were invested
wagons drew it from town to town boats bore it from clime to clime
and the winds wafted it from nation to nation and merchants bought and sold it
by wholesale and retail
with precisely the same feelings on the part of the seller
and bystander as are felt at the selling and buying of ploughs
or any other of the real necessaries of life
universal public opinion not only tolerated but recognized and adopted its use
it is true that even then it was known and acknowledged that many were greatly injured by it but none seemed to think the injury arose from the use of a bad thing
but from the abuse of a very good thing
the victims of it were to be pitied and compassionated
just as are the heirs of consumption and other hereditary diseases
their failing was treated as a misfortune
and not as a crime
or even as a disgrace
what i have been saying is true
is it wonderful that some should think and act now as all thought and acted twenty years ago
and is it just to assail
or despise them for doing so
the universal sense of mankind on any subject is an argument
or at least an influence
not easily overcome
the success of the argument in favor of the existence of an overruling providence mainly depends upon that sense and men ought not in justice to be denounced for yielding to it in any case
or giving it up slowly
especially when they are backed by interest
fixed habits
or burning appetites
another error
as it seems to me
into which the old reformers fell
was the position that all habitual drunkards were utterly incorrigible
and therefore must be turned adrift and damned without remedy in order that the grace of temperance might abound
to the temperate then
and to all mankind some hundreds of years thereafter
there is in this some thing so repugnant to humanity
so uncharitable
so cold blooded and feelingless
that it
never did nor ever can enlist the enthusiasm of a popular cause
we could not love the man who taught it we could not hear him with patience
the heart could not throw open its portals to it
the generous man could not adopt it it could not mix with his blood
it looked so fiendishly selfish
so like throwing fathers and brothers overboard to lighten the boat for our security
that the noble minded shrank from the manifest meanness of the thing
and besides this
the benefits of a reformation to be effected by such a system were too remote in point of time to warmly engage many in its behalf
few can be induced to labor exclusively for posterity
and none will do it enthusiastically
posterity has done nothing for us and
theorize on it as we may
practically we shall do very little for it
unless we are made to think we are at the same time doing something for ourselves
what an ignorance of human nature does it exhibit to ask or to expect a whole community to rise up and labor for the temporal happiness of others
after themselves shall be consigned to the dust
a majority of which community take no pains whatever to secure their own eternal welfare at no more distant day
great distance in either time or space has wonderful power to lull and render quiescent the human mind
pleasures to be enjoyed
or pains to be endured
after we shall be dead and gone are but little regarded even in our own cases
and much less in the cases of others
in addition to this there is something so ludicrous in promises of good or threats of evil a great way off as to render the whole subject with which they are connected easily turned into ridicule
better lay down that spade you are stealing
paddy if you don't you'll pay for it at the day of judgment
be the powers
if ye'll credit me so long i'll take another jist
by the washingtonians this system of consigning the habitual drunkard to hopeless ruin is repudiated
they adopt a more enlarged philanthropy they go for present as well as future good
they labor for all now living
as well as hereafter to live
they teach hope to all despair to none
as applying to their cause
they deny the doctrine of unpardonable sin as in christianity it is taught
so in this they teach while while the lamp holds out to burn
the vilest sinner may return
and
what is a matter of more profound congratulation
by experiment upon experiment and example upon example
prove the maxim to be no less true in the one case than in the other
on every hand we behold those who but yesterday were the chief of sinners
now the chief apostles of the cause
drunken devils are cast out by ones
by sevens
by legions and their unfortunate victims
like the poor possessed who were redeemed from their long and lonely wanderings in the tombs
are publishing to the ends of the earth how great things have been done for them
to these new champions and this new system of tactics our late success is mainly owing
and to them we must mainly look for the final consummation
the ball is now rolling gloriously on
and none are so able as they to increase its speed and its bulk
to add to its momentum and its magnitude even though unlearned in letters
for this task none are so well educated
to fit them for this work they have been taught in the true school
they have been in that gulf from which they would teach others the means of escape
they have passed that prison wall which others have long declared impassable and who that has not shall dare to weigh opinions with them as to the mode of passing
but if it be true
as i have insisted
that those who have suffered by intemperance personally
and have reformed
are the most powerful and efficient instruments to push the reformation to ultimate success
it does not follow that those who have not suffered have no part left them to perform
whether or not the world would be vastly benefited by a total and final banishment from it of all intoxicating drinks seems to me not now an open question
three fourths of mankind confess the affirmative with their tongues
i believe
all the rest acknowledge it in their hearts
ought any
to refuse their aid in doing what good the good of the whole demands
shall he who cannot do much be for that reason excused if he do nothing
says one
what good can i do by signing the pledge
i never drank
even without signing
this question has already been asked and answered more than a million of times
let it be answered once more
for the man suddenly or in any other way to break off from the use of drams
who has indulged in them for a long course of years and until his appetite for them has grown ten or a hundredfold stronger and more craving than any natural appetite can be
requires a most powerful moral effort
in such an undertaking he needs every moral support and influence that can possibly be brought to his aid and thrown around him
and not only so
but every moral prop should be taken from whatever argument might rise in his mind to lure him to his backsliding
when he casts his eyes around him
he should be able to see all that he respects
all that he admires
all that he loves
kindly and anxiously pointing him onward
and none beckoning him back to his former miserable wallowing in the mire
but it is said by some that men will think and act for themselves that none will disuse spirits or anything else because his neighbors do and that moral influence is not that powerful engine contended for
let us examine this
let me ask the man who could maintain this position most stiffly
what compensation he will accept to go to church some sunday and sit during the sermon with his wife's bonnet upon his head
not a trifle
i'll venture
and why not
there would be nothing irreligious in it
nothing immoral
nothing uncomfortable then why not
is it not because there would be something egregiously unfashionable in it
then it is the influence of fashion and what is the influence of fashion but the influence that other people's actions have on our actions the strong inclination each of us feels to do as we see all our neighbors do
nor is the influence of fashion confined to any particular thing or class of things it is just as strong on one subject as another
let us make it as unfashionable to withhold our names from the temperance cause as for husbands to wear their wives' bonnets to church
and instances will be just as rare in the one case as the other
say some
we are no drunkards
and we shall not acknowledge ourselves such by joining a reformed drunkard's society
whatever our influence might be
surely no christian will adhere to this objection
if they believe as they profess
that omnipotence condescended to take on himself the form of sinful man
and as such to die an ignominious death for their sakes
surely they will not refuse submission to the infinitely lesser condescension
for the temporal
and perhaps eternal
salvation of a large
and unfortunate class of their fellow creatures
nor is the condescension very great
in my judgment such of us as have never fallen victims have been spared more by the absence of appetite than from any mental or moral superiority over those who have
i believe if we take habitual drunkards as a class
their heads and their hearts will bear an advantageous comparison with those of any other class
there seems ever to have been a proneness in the brilliant and warm blooded to fall into this vice the demon of intemperance ever seems to have delighted in sucking the blood of genius and of generosity
what one of us but can call to mind some relative
more promising in youth than all his fellows
who has fallen a sacrifice to his rapacity
he ever seems to have gone forth like the egyptian angel of death
commissioned to slay
if not the first
the fairest born of every family
shall he now be arrested in his desolating career
in that arrest all can give aid that will and who shall be excused that can and will not
far around as human breath has ever blown he keeps our fathers
our brothers
our sons
and our friends prostrate in the chains of moral death
to all the living everywhere we cry
come sound the moral trump
that these may rise and stand up an exceeding great army
come from the four winds
o breath
and breathe upon these slain that they may live
if the relative grandeur of revolutions shall be estimated by the great amount of human misery they alleviate
and the small amount they inflict
then indeed will this be the grandest the world shall ever have seen
of our political revolution of '76 we are all justly proud
it has given us a degree of political freedom far exceeding that of any other nation of the earth
in it the world has found a solution of the long mooted problem as to the capability of man to govern himself
in it was the germ which has vegetated
and still is to grow and expand into the universal liberty of mankind
with all these glorious results
and to come
it had its evils too
it breathed forth famine
swam in blood
and rode in fire and long
long after
the orphan's cry and the widow's wail continued to break the sad silence that ensued
these were the price
the inevitable price
paid for the blessings it bought
turn now to the temperance revolution
in it we shall find a stronger bondage broken
a viler slavery manumitted
a greater tyrant deposed in it
more of want supplied
more disease healed
more sorrow assuaged
by it no orphans starving
no widows weeping
by it none wounded in feeling
none injured in interest even the drammaker and dram seller will have glided into other occupations so gradually as never to have felt the change
and will stand ready to join all others in the universal song of gladness
and what a noble ally this to the cause of political freedom
with such an aid its march cannot fail to be on and on
till every son of earth shall drink in rich fruition the sorrow quenching draughts of perfect liberty
happy day when all appetites controlled
all poisons subdued
all matter subjected mind
all conquering mind
shall live and move
the monarch of the world
glorious consummation
fall of fury
reign of reason
all hail
and when the victory shall be complete
when there shall be neither a slave nor a drunkard on the earth
how proud the title of that land which may truly claim to be the birthplace and the cradle of both those revolutions that shall have ended in that victory
how nobly distinguished that people who shall have planted and nurtured to maturity both the political and moral freedom of their species
this is the one hundred and tenth anniversary of the birthday of washington we are met to celebrate this day
washington is the mightiest name of earth long since mightiest in the cause of civil liberty
still mightiest in moral reformation
on that name no eulogy is expected
it cannot be
to add brightness to the sun or glory to the name of washington is alike impossible
let none attempt it
in solemn awe pronounce the name
and in its naked deathless splendor leave it shining on

dear speed
yours of the 16th instant
announcing that miss fanny and you are no more twain
but one flesh
reached me this morning
i have no way of telling you how much happiness i wish you both
though i believe you both can conceive it
i feel somewhat jealous of both of you now
you will be so exclusively concerned for one another
that i shall be forgotten entirely
my acquaintance with miss fanny i call her this
lest you should think i am speaking of your mother was too short for me to reasonably hope to long be remembered by her and still i am sure i shall not forget her soon
try if you cannot remind her of that debt she owes me and be sure you do not interfere to prevent her paying it
i regret to learn that you have resolved to not return to illinois
i shall be very lonesome without you
how miserably things seem to be arranged in this world
if we have no friends
we have no pleasure and if we have them
we are sure to lose them
and be doubly pained by the loss
i did hope she and you would make your home here but i own i have no right to insist
you owe obligations to her ten thousand times more sacred than you can owe to others
and in that light let them be respected and observed
it is natural that she should desire to remain with her relatives and friends
as to friends
she could not need them anywhere

dear speed
i received yours of the 12th written the day you went down to william's place
some days since
but delayed answering it till i should receive the promised one of the 16th
which came last night
i opened the letter with intense anxiety and trepidation so much so
although it turned out better than i expected
i have hardly yet
at a distance of ten hours
become calm
i tell you
our forebodings for which you and i are peculiar are all the worst sort of nonsense
i fancied
from the time i received your letter of saturday
that the one of wednesday was never to come
and yet it did come
and what is more
it is perfectly clear
both from its tone and handwriting
that you were much happier
if you think the term preferable
less miserable
when you wrote it than when you wrote the last one before
you had so obviously improved at the very time i so much fancied you would have grown worse
you say that something indescribably horrible and alarming still haunts you
you will not say that three months from now
i will venture
when your nerves once get steady now
the whole trouble will be over forever
nor should you become impatient at their being even very slow in becoming steady
again you say
you much fear that that elysium of which you have dreamed so much is never to be realized
if it shall not
i dare swear it will not be the fault of her who is now your wife
i now have no doubt that it is the peculiar misfortune of both you and me to dream dreams of elysium far exceeding all that anything earthly can realize
far short of your dreams as you may be
no woman could do more to realize them than that same black eyed fanny
if you could but contemplate her through my imagination
it would appear ridiculous to you that any one should for a moment think of being unhappy with her
my old father used to have a saying that if you make a bad bargain
hug it all the tighter and it occurs to me that if the bargain you have just closed can possibly be called a bad one
it is certainly the most pleasant one for applying that maxim to which my fancy can by any effort picture
i write another letter
enclosing this
which you can show her
if she desires it
i do this because she would think strangely
should you tell her that you received no letters from me
telling her you do
refuse to let her see them
i close this
entertaining the confident hope that every successive letter i shall have from you which i here pray may not be few
nor far between may show you possessing a more steady hand and cheerful heart than the last preceding it
as ever
your friend

1842 dear speed
yours of the 10th instant was received three or four days since
you know i am sincere when i tell you the pleasure its contents gave me was
and is
as to your farm matter
i have no sympathy with you
i have no farm
nor ever expect to have
and consequently have not studied the subject enough to be much interested with it
i can only say that i am glad you are satisfied and pleased with it
but on that other subject
to me of the most intense interest whether in joy or sorrow
i never had the power to withhold my sympathy from you
it cannot be told how it now thrills me with joy to hear you say you are far happier than you ever expected to be
that much i know is enough
i know you too well to suppose your expectations were not
at least
sometimes extravagant
and if the reality exceeds them all
i say
dear lord
i am not going beyond the truth when i tell you that the short space it took me to read your last letter gave me more pleasure than the total sum of all i have enjoyed since the fatal 1st of january
since then it seems to me i should have been entirely happy
but for the never absent idea that there is one still unhappy whom i have contributed to make so
that still kills my soul
i cannot but reproach myself for even wishing to be happy while she is otherwise
she accompanied a large party on the railroad cars to jacksonville last monday
and on her return spoke
so that i heard of it
of having enjoyed the trip exceedingly
god be praised for that
you know with what sleepless vigilance i have watched you ever since the commencement of your affair and although i am almost confident it is useless
i cannot forbear once more to say that i think it is even yet possible for your spirits to flag down and leave you miserable
if they should
don't fail to remember that they cannot long remain so
one thing i can tell you which i know you will be glad to hear
and that is that i have seen and scrutinized her feelings as well as i could
and am fully convinced she is far happier now than she has been for the last fifteen months past
you will see by the last sangamon journal
that i made a temperance speech on the 22d of february
which i claim that fanny and you shall read as an act of charity to me for i cannot learn that anybody else has read it
or is likely to
fortunately it is not very long
and i shall deem it a sufficient compliance with my request if one of you listens while the other reads it
as to your lockridge matter
it is only necessary to say that there has been no court since you left
and that the next commences to morrow morning
during which i suppose we cannot fail to get a judgment
i wish you would learn of everett what he would take
over and above a discharge for all the trouble we have been at
to take his business out of our hands and give it to somebody else
it is impossible to collect money on that or any other claim here now and although you know i am not a very petulant man
i declare i am almost out of patience with mr
everett's importunity
it seems like he not only writes all the letters he can himself
but gets everybody else in louisville and vicinity to be constantly writing to us about his claim
i have always said that mr
everett is a very clever fellow
and i am very sorry he cannot be obliged but it does seem to me he ought to know we are interested to collect his claim
and therefore would do it if we could
i am neither joking nor in a pet when i say we would thank him to transfer his business to some other
without any compensation for what we have done
provided he will see the court cost paid
for which we are security
the sweet violet you inclosed came safely to hand
but it was so dry
and mashed so flat
that it crumbled to dust at the first attempt to handle it
the juice that mashed out of it stained a place in the letter
which i mean to preserve and cherish for the sake of her who procured it to be sent
my renewed good wishes to her in particular
and generally to all such of your relations who know me
as ever
to joshua f
july 4
dear speed
yours of the 16th june was received only a day or two since
it was not mailed at louisville till the 25th
you speak of the great time that has elapsed since i wrote you
let me explain that
your letter reached here a day or two after i started on the circuit
i was gone five or six weeks
so that i got the letters only a few weeks before butler started to your country
i thought it scarcely worth while to write you the news which he could and would tell you more in detail
on his return he told me you would write me soon
and so i waited for your letter
as to my having been displeased with your advice
surely you know better than that
i know you do
and therefore will not labor to convince you
that subject is painful to me but it is not your silence
or the silence of all the world
that can make me forget it
i acknowledge the correctness of your advice too but before i resolve to do the one thing or the other
i must gain my confidence in my own ability to keep my resolves when they are made
in that ability you know i once prided myself as the only or chief gem of my character that gem i lost how and where you know too well
i have not yet regained it and until i do
i cannot trust myself in any matter of much importance
i believe now that had you understood my case at the time as well as i understand yours afterward
by the aid you would have given me i should have sailed through clear
but that does not now afford me sufficient confidence to begin that or the like of that again
you make a kind acknowledgment of your obligations to me for your present happiness
i am pleased with that acknowledgment
but a thousand times more am i pleased to know that you enjoy a degree of happiness worthy of an acknowledgment
the truth is
i am not sure that there was any merit with me in the part i took in your difficulty i was drawn to it by a fate
if i would i could not have done less than i did
i always was superstitious i believe god made me one of the instruments of bringing your fanny and you together
which union i have no doubt he had fore ordained
whatever he designs he will do for me yet
stand still
and see the salvation of the lord is my text just now
as you say
you have told fanny all
i should have no objection to her seeing this letter
but for its reference to our friend here
let her seeing it depend upon whether she has ever known anything of my affairs and if she has not
do not let her
i do not think i can come to kentucky this season
i am so poor and make so little headway in the world
that i drop back in a month of idleness as much as i gain in a year's sowing
i should like to visit you again
i should like to see that sis of yours that was absent when i was there
though i suppose she would run away again if she were to hear i was coming
my respects and esteem to all your friends there
by your permission
my love to your fanny
ever yours
a letter from the lost townships article written by lincoln for the sangamon journal in ridicule of james shields
as state auditor
had declined to receive state bank notes in payment of taxes
the above letter purported to come from a poor widow who
though supplied with state bank paper
could not obtain a receipt for her tax bill
and another subsequent letter by mary todd
brought about the lincoln shields duel
lost townships august 27
dear mr
i see you printed that long letter i sent you a spell ago
i 'm quite encouraged by it
and can't keep from writing again
i think the printing of my letters will be a good thing all round it will give me the benefit of being known by the world
and give the world the advantage of knowing what's going on in the lost townships
and give your paper respectability besides
so here comes another
yesterday afternoon i hurried through cleaning up the dinner dishes and stepped over to neighbor s to see if his wife peggy was as well as mout be expected
and hear what they called the baby
when i got there and just turned round the corner of his log cabin
there he was
setting on the doorstep reading a newspaper
how are you
says i
he sorter started when he heard me
for he hadn't seen me before
says he
i 'm mad as the devil
aunt 'becca
what about
says i ain't its hair the right color
none of that nonsense
jeff there ain't an honester woman in the lost townships than
than who
says he what the mischief are you about
i began to see i was running the wrong trail
and so says i
i guess i was mistaken a little
that's all
but what is it you 're mad about
why
says he
i've been tugging ever since harvest
getting out wheat and hauling it to the river to raise state bank paper enough to pay my tax this year and a little school debt i owe and now
just as i 've got it
here i open this infernal extra register
expecting to find it full of 'glorious democratic victories' and 'high comb'd cocks
 when
lo and behold
i find a set of fellows
calling themselves officers of the state
have forbidden the tax collectors
and school commissioners to receive state paper at all and so here it is dead on my hands
i don't now believe all the plunder i've got will fetch ready cash enough to pay my taxes and that school debt
i was a good deal thunderstruck myself for that was the first i had heard of the proclamation
and my old man was pretty much in the same fix with jeff
we both stood a moment staring at one another without knowing what to say
at last says i
s let me look at that paper
he handed it to me
when i read the proclamation over
there now
says he
did you ever see such a piece of impudence and imposition as that
i saw jeff was in a good tune for saying some ill natured things
and so i tho't i would just argue a little on the contrary side
and make him rant a spell if i could
says i
looking as dignified and thoughtful as i could
it seems pretty tough
to be sure
to have to raise silver where there's none to be raised but then
you see
there will be danger of loss' if it ain't done
loss
says he
i defy daniel webster
i defy king solomon
i defy the world i defy i defy yes
i defy even you
aunt 'becca
to show how the people can lose anything by paying their taxes in state paper
well
says i
you see what the officers of state say about it
and they are a desarnin' set of men
says i
i guess you 're mistaken about what the proclamation says
it don't say the people will lose anything by the paper money being taken for taxes
it only says 'there will be danger of loss' and though it is tolerable plain that the people can't lose by paying their taxes in something they can get easier than silver
instead of having to pay silver and though it's just as plain that the state can't lose by taking state bank paper
however low it may be
while she owes the bank more than the whole revenue
and can pay that paper over on her debt
dollar for dollar still there is danger of loss to the 'officers of state' and you know
we can't get along without officers of state
damn officers of state
says he that's what whigs are always hurrahing for
now
don't swear so
says i
you know i belong to the meetin
and swearin' hurts my feelings
beg pardon
aunt 'becca
says he but i do say it's enough to make dr
goddard swear
to have tax to pay in silver
for nothing only that ford may get his two thousand a year
and shields his twenty four hundred a year
and carpenter his sixteen hundred a year
and all without 'danger of loss' by taking it in state paper
it's plain enough now what these officers of state mean by 'danger of loss
 wash
i s'pose
actually lost fifteen hundred dollars out of the three thousand that two of these 'officers of state' let him steal from the treasury
by being compelled to take it in state paper
wonder if we don't have a proclamation before long
commanding us to make up this loss to wash in silver
and so he went on till his breath run out
and he had to stop
i couldn't think of anything to say just then
and so i begun to look over the paper again
here's another proclamation
or something like it
another
says jeff and whose egg is it
i looked to the bottom of it
and read aloud
your obedient servant
james shields
aha
says jeff
one of them same three fellows again
well read it
and let's hear what of it
i read on till i came to where it says
the object of this measure is to suspend the collection of the revenue for the current year
now stop
now stop
says he that's a lie a'ready
and i don't want to hear of it
oh
maybe not
says i
i say it is a lie
suspend the collection
will the collectors
that have taken their oaths to make the collection
dare to end it
is there anything in law requiring them to perjure themselves at the bidding of james shields
will the greedy gullet of the penitentiary be satisfied with swallowing him instead of all of them
if they should venture to obey him
and would he not discover some 'danger of loss
 and be off about the time it came to taking their places
and suppose the people attempt to suspend
by refusing to pay what then
the collectors would just jerk up their horses and cows
and the like
and sell them to the highest bidder for silver in hand
without valuation or redemption
shields didn't believe that story himself it was never meant for the truth
if it was true
why was it not writ till five days after the proclamation
why did n't carlin and carpenter sign it as well as shields
answer me that
aunt 'becca
i say it's a lie
and not a well told one at that
it grins out like a copper dollar
shields is a fool as well as a liar
with him truth is out of the question and as for getting a good
passable lie out of him
you might as well try to strike fire from a cake of tallow
i stick to it
it's all an infernal whig lie
a whig lie
highty tighty
yes
a whig lie and it's just like everything the cursed british whigs do
first they'll do some divilment
and then they'll tell a lie to hide it
and they don't care how plain a lie it is they think they can cram any sort of a one down the throats of the ignorant locofocos
as they call the democrats
why
you 're crazy
you don't mean to say shields is a whig
yes
i do
why
look here
the proclamation is in your own democratic paper
as you call it
i know it and what of that
they only printed it to let us democrats see the deviltry the whigs are at
well
but shields is the auditor of this loco i mean this democratic state
so he is
and tyler appointed him to office
tyler appointed him
yes if you must chaw it over
tyler appointed him or
if it was n't him
it was old granny harrison
and that's all one
i tell you
aunt 'becca
there's no mistake about his being a whig
his very looks shows it everything about him shows it
if i was deaf and blind
i could tell him by the smell
i seed him when i was down in springfield last winter
they had a sort of a gatherin' there one night among the grandees
they called a fair
all the gals about town was there
and all the handsome widows and married women
finickin' about trying to look like gals
tied as tight in the middle
and puffed out at both ends
like bundles of fodder that had n't been stacked yet
but wanted stackin' pretty bad
and then they had tables all around the house kivered over with caps and pincushions and ten thousand such little knick knacks
tryin' to sell 'em to the fellows that were bowin
and scrapin' and kungeerin' about 'em
they would n't let no democrats in
for fear they'd disgust the ladies
or scare the little gals
or dirty the floor
i looked in at the window
and there was this same fellow shields floatin' about on the air
without heft or earthly substances
just like a lock of cat fur where cats had been fighting
he was paying his money to this one
and that one
and t' other one
and sufferin' great loss because it was n't silver instead of state paper and the sweet distress he seemed to be in
his very features
in the ecstatic agony of his soul
spoke audibly and distinctly
dear girls
it is distressing
but i cannot marry you all
too well i know how much you suffer but do
do remember
it is not my fault that i am so handsome and so interesting
 as this last was expressed by a most exquisite contortion of his face
he seized hold of one of their hands
and squeezed
and held on to it about a quarter of an hour
my good fellow
 says i to myself
if that was one of our democratic gals in the lost townships
the way you 'd get a brass pin let into you would be about up to the head
 he a democrat
i tell you
aunt 'becca
he's a whig
and no mistake nobody but a whig could make such a conceity dunce of himself
well
says i
maybe he is but
if he is
i 'm mistaken the worst sort
maybe so
maybe so but
if i am
i'll suffer by it i'll be a democrat if it turns out that shields is a whig
considerin' you shall be a whig if he turns out a democrat
a bargain
by jingoes
says he but how will we find out
why
says i
we'll just write and ax the printer
agreed again
says he and by thunder
if it does turn out that shields is a democrat
i never will jefferson
what do you want
do get through your everlasting clatter some time
and bring me a gourd of water the child's been crying for a drink this livelong hour
let it die
then it may as well die for water as to be taxed to death to fatten officers of state
jeff run off to get the water
just like he hadn't been saying anything spiteful
for he's a raal good hearted fellow
after all
once you get at the foundation of him
i walked into the house
says i
i declare we like to forgot you altogether
oh
says she
when a body can't help themselves
everybody soon forgets 'em but
thank god
by day after to morrow i shall be well enough to milk the cows
and pen the calves
and wring the contrary ones' tails for 'em
and no thanks to nobody
good evening
says i
and so i sloped
for i seed she was mad at me for making jeff neglect her so long
and now
will you be sure to let us know in your next paper whether this shields is a whig or a democrat
i don't care about it for myself
for i know well enough how it is already but i want to convince jeff
it may do some good to let him
and others like him
know who and what these officers of state are
it may help to send the present hypocritical set to where they belong
and to fill the places they now disgrace with men who will do more work for less pay
and take fewer airs while they are doing it
it ain't sensible to think that the same men who get us in trouble will change their course and yet it's pretty plain if some change for the better is not made
it's not long that either peggy or i or any of us will have a cow left to milk
or a calf's tail to wring
yours truly
rebecca

dear sir
we hear you are to visit indianapolis
on the 5th of october next
if our information in this is correct we hope you will not deny us the pleasure of seeing you in our state
we are aware of the toil necessarily incident to a journey by one circumstanced as you are but once you have embarked
as you have already determined to do
the toil would not be greatly augmented by extending the journey to our capital
the season of the year will be most favorable for good roads
and pleasant weather and although we cannot but believe you would be highly gratified with such a visit to the prairie land
the pleasure it would give us and thousands such as we is beyond all question
you have never visited illinois
or at least this portion of it and should you now yield to our request
we promise you such a reception as shall be worthy of the man on whom are now turned the fondest hopes of a great and suffering nation
please inform us at the earliest convenience whether we may expect you

september 17
i regret that my absence on public business compelled me to postpone a matter of private consideration a little longer than i could have desired
it will only be necessary
to account for it by informing you that i have been to quincy on business that would not admit of delay
i will now state briefly the reasons of my troubling you with this communication
the disagreeable nature of which i regret
as i had hoped to avoid any difficulty with any one in springfield while residing there
by endeavoring to conduct myself in such a way amongst both my political friends and opponents as to escape the necessity of any
whilst thus abstaining from giving provocation
i have become the object of slander
and personal abuse
which were i capable of submitting to
i would prove myself worthy of the whole of it
in two or three of the last numbers of the sangamon journal
articles of the most personal nature and calculated to degrade me have made their appearance
on inquiring
i was informed by the editor of that paper
through the medium of my friend general whitesides
that you are the author of those articles
this information satisfies me that i have become by some means or other the object of your secret hostility
i will not take the trouble of inquiring into the reason of all this but i will take the liberty of requiring a full
and absolute retraction of all offensive allusions used by you in these communications
in relation to my private character and standing as a man
as an apology for the insults conveyed in them
this may prevent consequences which no one will regret more than myself
your obedient servant

your note of to day was handed me by general whitesides
in that note you say you have been informed
through the medium of the editor of the journal
that i am the author of certain articles in that paper which you deem personally abusive of you and without stopping to inquire whether i really am the author
or to point out what is offensive in them
you demand an unqualified retraction of all that is offensive
and then proceed to hint at consequences
there is in this so much assumption of facts and so much of menace as to consequences
that i cannot submit to answer that note any further than i have
and to add that the consequences to which i suppose you allude would be matter of as great regret to me as it possibly could to you
to a

september 17
in reply to my note of this date
you intimate that i assume facts and menace consequences
and that you cannot submit to answer it further
as now
you desire it
i will be a little more particular
the editor of the sangamon journal gave me to understand that you are the author of an article which appeared
i think
in that paper of the 2d september instant
headed the lost townships
and signed rebecca or 'becca
i would therefore take the liberty of asking whether you are the author of said article
or any other over the same signature which has appeared in any of the late numbers of that paper
if so
i repeat my request of an absolute retraction of all offensive allusions contained therein in relation to my private character and standing
if you are not the author of any of these articles
your denial will be sufficient
i will say further
it is not my intention to menace
but to do myself justice

in case whitesides shall signify a wish to adjust this affair without further difficulty
let him know that if the present papers be withdrawn
and a note from mr
shields asking to know if i am the author of the articles of which he complains
and asking that i shall make him gentlemanly satisfaction if i am the author
and this without menace
or dictation as to what that satisfaction shall be
a pledge is made that the following answer shall be given
i did write the 'lost townships' letter which appeared in the journal of the 2d instant
but had no participation in any form in any other article alluding to you
i wrote that wholly for political effect i had no intention of injuring your personal or private character or standing as a man or a gentleman and i did not then think
and do not now think
that that article could produce or has produced that effect against you and had i anticipated such an effect i would have forborne to write it
and i will add that your conduct toward me
so far as i know
had always been gentlemanly and that i had no personal pique against you
and no cause for any
if this should be done
i leave it with you to arrange what shall and what shall not be published
if nothing like this is done
the preliminaries of the fight are to be first
cavalry broadswords of the largest size
precisely equal in all respects
and such as now used by the cavalry company at jacksonville
a plank ten feet long
and from nine to twelve inches broad
to be firmly fixed on edge
on the ground
as the line between us
which neither is to pass his foot over upon forfeit of his life
next a line drawn on the ground on either side of said plank and parallel with it
each at the distance of the whole length of the sword and three feet additional from the plank and the passing of his own such line by either party during the fight shall be deemed a surrender of the contest
on thursday evening at five o'clock
if you can get it so but in no case to be at a greater distance of time than friday evening at five o'clock
within three miles of alton
on the opposite side of the river
the particular spot to be agreed on by you
any preliminary details coming within the above rules you are at liberty to make at your discretion but you are in no case to swerve from these rules
or to pass beyond their limits

dear speed
you have heard of my duel with shields
and i have now to inform you that the dueling business still rages in this city
day before yesterday shields challenged butler
who accepted
and proposed fighting next morning at sunrise in bob allen's meadow
one hundred yards' distance
with rifles
to this whitesides
shields's second
said no
because of the law
thus ended duel no
yesterday whitesides chose to consider himself insulted by dr
so sent him a kind of quasi challenge
inviting him to meet him at the planter's house in st
louis on the next friday
to settle their difficulty
merryman made me his friend
and sent whitesides a note
inquiring to know if he meant his note as a challenge
and if so
that he would
according to the law in such case made and provided
prescribe the terms of the meeting
whitesides returned for answer that if merryman would meet him at the planter's house as desired
he would challenge him
merryman replied in a note that he denied whitesides's right to dictate time and place
but that he merryman would waive the question of time
and meet him at louisiana
upon my presenting this note to whitesides and stating verbally its contents
he declined receiving it
saying he had business in st
and it was as near as louisiana
merryman then directed me to notify whitesides that he should publish the correspondence between them
with such comments as he thought fit
this i did
thus it stood at bedtime last night
this morning whitesides
by his friend shields
is praying for a new trial
on the ground that he was mistaken in merryman's proposition to meet him at louisiana
thinking it was the state of louisiana
this merryman hoots at
and is preparing his publication while the town is in a ferment
and a street fight somewhat anticipated
but i began this letter not for what i have been writing
but to say something on that subject which you know to be of such infinite solicitude to me
the immense sufferings you endured from the first days of september till the middle of february you never tried to conceal from me
and i well understood
you have now been the husband of a lovely woman nearly eight months
that you are happier now than the day you married her i well know
for without you could not be living
but i have your word for it
and the returning elasticity of spirits which is manifested in your letters
but i want to ask a close question
are you now in feeling as well as judgment glad that you are married as you are
from anybody but me this would be an impudent question
not to be tolerated but i know you will pardon it in me
please answer it quickly
as i am impatient to know
i have sent my love to your fanny so often
i fear she is getting tired of it
i venture to tender it again
yours forever

1843 resolutions at a whig meeting at springfield
march 1
the object of the meeting was stated by mr
lincoln of springfield
who offered the following resolutions
which were unanimously adopted
that a tariff of duties on imported goods
producing sufficient revenue for the payment of the necessary expenditures of the national government
and so adjusted as to protect american industry
is indispensably necessary to the prosperity of the american people
that we are opposed to direct taxation for the support of the national government
that a national bank
properly restricted
is highly necessary and proper to the establishment and maintenance of a sound currency
and for the cheap and safe collection
and disbursing of the public revenue
that the distribution of the proceeds of the sales of the public lands
upon the principles of mr
clay's bill
accords with the best interests of the nation
and particularly with those of the state of illinois
that we recommend to the whigs of each congressional district of the state to nominate and support at the approaching election a candidate of their own principles
regardless of the chances of success
that we recommend to the whigs of all portions of the state to adopt and rigidly adhere to the convention system of nominating candidates
that we recommend to the whigs of each congressional district to hold a district convention on or before the first monday of may next
to be composed of a number of delegates from each county equal to double the number of its representatives in the general assembly
each county shall have at least one delegate
said delegates to be chosen by primary meetings of the whigs
at such times and places as they in their respective counties may see fit
said district conventions each to nominate one candidate for congress
and one delegate to a national convention for the purpose of nominating candidates for president and vice president of the united states
the seven delegates so nominated to a national convention to have power to add two delegates to their own number
and to fill all vacancies
that a
and a
lincoln be appointed a committee to prepare an address to the people of the state
that n
james h
john c
and james c
conkling be appointed a whig central state committee
with authority to fill any vacancy that may occur in the committee
circular from whig committee
address to the people of illinois
by a resolution of a meeting of such of the whigs of the state as are now at springfield
the undersigned
were appointed to prepare an address to you
the performance of that task we now undertake
several resolutions were adopted by the meeting and the chief object of this address is to show briefly the reasons for their adoption
the first of those resolutions declares a tariff of duties upon foreign importations
producing sufficient revenue for the support of the general government
and so adjusted as to protect american industry
to be indispensably necessary to the prosperity of the american people and the second declares direct taxation for a national revenue to be improper
those two resolutions are kindred in their nature
and therefore proper and convenient to be considered together
the question of protection is a subject entirely too broad to be crowded into a few pages only
together with several other subjects
on that point we therefore content ourselves with giving the following extracts from the writings of mr
general jackson
and the speech of mr
to be independent for the comforts of life
we must fabricate them ourselves
we must now place the manufacturer by the side of the agriculturalist
the grand inquiry now is
shall we make our own comforts
or go without them at the will of a foreign nation
who is now against domestic manufactures must be for reducing us either to dependence on that foreign nation
or to be clothed in skins and to live like wild beasts in dens and caverns
i am not one of those experience has taught me that manufactures are now as necessary to our independence as to our comfort
letter of mr
jefferson to benjamin austin
i ask
what is the real situation of the agriculturalist
where has the american farmer a market for his surplus produce
except for cotton
he has neither a foreign nor a home market
does not this clearly prove
when there is no market at home or abroad
that there is too much labor employed in agriculture
common sense at once points out the remedy
take from agriculture six hundred thousand men
and children
and you will at once give a market for more breadstuffs than all europe now furnishes
in short
we have been too long subject to the policy of british merchants
it is time we should become a little more americanized
and instead of feeding the paupers and laborers of england
feed our own or else in a short time
by continuing our present policy
we shall all be rendered paupers ourselves
general jackson's letter to dr
when our manufactures are grown to a certain perfection
as they soon will be
under the fostering care of government
the farmer will find a ready market for his surplus produce
and what is of equal consequence a certain and cheap supply of all he wants his prosperity will diffuse itself to every class of the community
speech of hon
calhoun on the tariff
the question of revenue we will now briefly consider
for several years past the revenues of the government have been unequal to its expenditures
and consequently loan after loan
sometimes direct and sometimes indirect in form
has been resorted to
by this means a new national debt has been created
and is still growing on us with a rapidity fearful to contemplate a rapidity only reasonably to be expected in time of war
this state of things has been produced by a prevailing unwillingness either to increase the tariff or resort to direct taxation
but the one or the other must come
coming expenditures must be met
and the present debt must be paid and money cannot always be borrowed for these objects
the system of loans is but temporary in its nature
and must soon explode
it is a system not only ruinous while it lasts
but one that must soon fail and leave us destitute
as an individual who undertakes to live by borrowing soon finds his original means devoured by interest
no one left to borrow from
so must it be with a government
we repeat
that a tariff sufficient for revenue
or a direct tax
must soon be resorted to and
we believe this alternative is now denied by no one
but which system shall be adopted
some of our opponents
in theory
admit the propriety of a tariff sufficient for a revenue
but even they will not in practice vote for such a tariff while others boldly advocate direct taxation
as some of them boldly advocate direct taxation
and all the rest or so nearly all as to make exceptions needless refuse to adopt the tariff
we think it is doing them no injustice to class them all as advocates of direct taxation
we believe they are only delaying an open avowal of the system till they can assure themselves that the people will tolerate it
let us
briefly compare the two systems
the tariff is the cheaper system
because the duties
being collected in large parcels at a few commercial points
will require comparatively few officers in their collection while by the direct tax system the land must be literally covered with assessors and collectors
going forth like swarms of egyptian locusts
devouring every blade of grass and other green thing
by the tariff system the whole revenue is paid by the consumers of foreign goods
and those chiefly the luxuries
and not the necessaries
of life
by this system the man who contents himself to live upon the products of his own country pays nothing at all
and surely that country is extensive enough
and its products abundant and varied enough
to answer all the real wants of its people
in short
by this system the burthen of revenue falls almost entirely on the wealthy and luxurious few
while the substantial and laboring many who live at home
and upon home products
go entirely free
by the direct tax system none can escape
however strictly the citizen may exclude from his premises all foreign luxuries
fine cloths
fine silks
rich wines
golden chains
and diamond rings
for the possession of his house
his barn
and his homespun
he is to be perpetually haunted and harassed by the tax gatherer
with these views we leave it to be determined whether we or our opponents are the more truly democratic on the subject
the third resolution declares the necessity and propriety of a national bank
during the last fifty years so much has been said and written both as to the constitutionality and expediency of such an institution
that we could not hope to improve in the least on former discussions of the subject
were we to undertake it
upon the question of constitutionality content ourselves with remarking the facts that the first national bank was established chiefly by the same men who formed the constitution
at a time when that instrument was but two years old
and receiving the sanction
as president
of the immortal washington that the second received the sanction
as president
of mr
to whom common consent has awarded the proud title of father of the constitution and subsequently the sanction of the supreme court
the most enlightened judicial tribunal in the world
upon the question of expediency
we only ask you to examine the history of the times during the existence of the two banks
and compare those times with the miserable present
the fourth resolution declares the expediency of mr
clay's land bill
much incomprehensible jargon is often used against the constitutionality of this measure
we forbear
in this place
attempting an answer to it
simply because
in our opinion
those who urge it are through party zeal resolved not to see or acknowledge the truth
the question of expediency
at least so far as illinois is concerned
seems to us the clearest imaginable
by the bill we are to receive annually a large sum of money
no part of which we otherwise receive
the precise annual sum cannot be known in advance it doubtless will vary in different years
still it is something to know that in the last year a year of almost unparalleled pecuniary pressure it amounted to more than forty thousand dollars
this annual income
in the midst of our almost insupportable difficulties
in the days of our severest necessity
our political opponents are furiously resolving to take and keep from us
and for what
many silly reasons are given
as is usual in cases where a single good one is not to be found
one is that by giving us the proceeds of the lands we impoverish the national treasury
and thereby render necessary an increase of the tariff
this may be true but if so
the amount of it only is that those whose pride
whose abundance of means
prompt them to spurn the manufactures of our country
and to strut in british cloaks and coats and pantaloons
may have to pay a few cents more on the yard for the cloth that makes them
a terrible evil
to the illinois farmer
who never wore
nor ever expects to wear
a single yard of british goods in his whole life
another of their reasons is that by the passage and continuance of mr
clay's bill
we prevent the passage of a bill which would give us more
if it were sound in itself
is waging destructive war with the former position for if mr
clay's bill impoverishes the treasury too much
what shall be said of one that impoverishes it still more
but it is not sound in itself
it is not true that mr
clay's bill prevents the passage of one more favorable to us of the new states
considering the strength and opposite interest of the old states
the wonder is that they ever permitted one to pass so favorable as mr
the last twenty odd years' efforts to reduce the price of the lands
and to pass graduation bills and cession bills
prove the assertion to be true and if there were no experience in support of it
the reason itself is plain
the states in which none
or few
of the public lands lie
and those consequently interested against parting with them except for the best price
are the majority and a moment's reflection will show that they must ever continue the majority
because by the time one of the original new states ohio
for example becomes populous and gets weight in congress
the public lands in her limits are so nearly sold out that in every point material to this question she becomes an old state
she does not wish the price reduced
because there is none left for her citizens to buy she does not wish them ceded to the states in which they lie
because they no longer lie in her limits
and she will get nothing by the cession
in the nature of things
the states interested in the reduction of price
in graduation
in cession
and in all similar projects
never can be the majority
nor is there reason to hope that any of them can ever succeed as a democratic party measure
because we have heretofore seen that party in full power
year after year
with many of their leaders making loud professions in favor of these projects
and yet doing nothing
what reason
is there to believe they will hereafter do better
in every light in which we can view this question
it amounts simply to this
shall we accept our share of the proceeds under mr
clay's bill
or shall we rather reject that and get nothing
the fifth resolution recommends that a whig candidate for congress be run in every district
regardless of the chances of success
we are aware that it is sometimes a temporary gratification
when a friend cannot succeed
to be able to choose between opponents but we believe that that gratification is the seed time which never fails to be followed by a most abundant harvest of bitterness
by this policy we entangle ourselves
by voting for our opponents
such of us as do it in some measure estop ourselves to complain of their acts
however glaringly wrong we may believe them to be
by this policy no one portion of our friends can ever be certain as to what course another portion may adopt and by this want of mutual and perfect understanding our political identity is partially frittered away and lost
those who are thus elected by our aid ever become our bitterest persecutors
take a few prominent examples
in 1830 reynolds was elected governor in 1835 we exerted our whole strength to elect judge young to the united states senate
which effort
though failing
gave him the prominence that subsequently elected him in 1836 general ewing
was so elected to the united states senate and yet let us ask what three men have been more perseveringly vindictive in their assaults upon all our men and measures than they
during the last summer the whole state was covered with pamphlet editions of misrepresentations against us
methodized into chapters and verses
written by two of these same men
reynolds and young
in which they did not stop at charging us with error merely
but roundly denounced us as the designing enemies of human liberty
if it be the will of heaven that such men shall politically live
be it so but never
never again permit them to draw a particle of their sustenance from us
the sixth resolution recommends the adoption of the convention system for the nomination of candidates
this we believe to be of the very first importance
whether the system is right in itself we do not stop to inquire contenting ourselves with trying to show that
while our opponents use it
it is madness in us not to defend ourselves with it
experience has shown that we cannot successfully defend ourselves without it
for examples
look at the elections of last year
our candidate for governor
with the approbation of a large portion of the party
took the field without a nomination
and in open opposition to the system
wherever in the counties the whigs had held conventions and nominated candidates for the legislature
the aspirants who were not nominated were induced to rebel against the nominations
and to become candidates
as is said
on their own hook
and
go where you would into a large whig county
you were sure to find the whigs not contending shoulder to shoulder against the common enemy
but divided into factions
and fighting furiously with one another
the election came
and what was the result
the governor beaten
the whig vote being decreased many thousands since 1840
although the democratic vote had not increased any
beaten almost everywhere for members of the legislature
with her four hundred whig majority
sending a delegation half democratic vermillion
with her five hundred
doing the same coles
with her four hundred
sending two out of three and morgan
with her two hundred and fifty
sending three out of four
and this to say nothing of the numerous other less glaring examples the whole winding up with the aggregate number of twenty seven democratic representatives sent from whig counties
as to the senators
the result was of the same character
and it is most worthy to be remembered that of all the whigs in the state who ran against the regular nominees
a single one only was elected
although they succeeded in defeating the nominees almost by scores
they too were defeated
and the spoils chucklingly borne off by the common enemy
we do not mention the fact of many of the whigs opposing the convention system heretofore for the purpose of censuring them
far from it
we expressly protest against such a conclusion
we know they were generally
perhaps universally
as good and true whigs as we ourselves claim to be
we mention it merely to draw attention to the disastrous result it produced
as an example forever hereafter to be avoided
that union is strength is a truth that has been known
and declared in various ways and forms in all ages of the world
that great fabulist and philosopher aesop illustrated it by his fable of the bundle of sticks and he whose wisdom surpasses that of all philosophers has declared that a house divided against itself cannot stand
it is to induce our friends to act upon this important and universally acknowledged truth that we urge the adoption of the convention system
reflection will prove that there is no other way of practically applying it
in its application we know there will be incidents temporarily painful but
after all
those incidents will be fewer and less intense with than without the system
if two friends aspire to the same office it is certain that both cannot succeed
would it not
be much less painful to have the question decided by mutual friends some time before
than to snarl and quarrel until the day of election
and then both be beaten by the common enemy
before leaving this subject
we think proper to remark that we do not understand the resolution as intended to recommend the application of the convention system to the nomination of candidates for the small offices no way connected with politics though we must say we do not perceive that such an application of it would be wrong
the seventh resolution recommends the holding of district conventions in may next
for the purpose of nominating candidates for congress
the propriety of this rests upon the same reasons with that of the sixth
and therefore needs no further discussion
the eighth and ninth also relate merely to the practical application of the foregoing
and therefore need no discussion
before closing
permit us to add a few reflections on the present condition and future prospects of the whig party
in almost all the states we have fallen into the minority
and despondency seems to prevail universally among us
is there just cause for this
in 1840 we carried the nation by more than a hundred and forty thousand majority
our opponents charged that we did it by fraudulent voting but whatever they may have believed
we know the charge to be untrue
is that mighty host
have they gone over to the enemy
let the results of the late elections answer
every state which has fallen off from the whig cause since 1840 has done so not by giving more democratic votes than they did then
but by giving fewer whig
who was elected democratic governor of new york last fall by more than 15
000 majority
had not then as many votes as he had in 1840
when he was beaten by seven or eight thousand
and so has it been in all the other states which have fallen away from our cause
from this it is evident that tens of thousands in the late elections have not voted at all
who and what are they
is an important question
as respects the future
they can come forward and give us the victory again
that all
or nearly all
of them are whigs is most apparent
our opponents
stung to madness by the defeat of 1840
have ever since rallied with more than their usual unanimity
it has not been they that have been kept from the polls
these facts show what the result must be
once the people again rally in their entire strength
proclaim these facts
and predict this result and although unthinking opponents may smile at us
the sagacious ones will believe and tremble
and why shall the whigs not all rally again
are their principles less dear now than in 1840
have any of their doctrines since then been discovered to be untrue
it is true
the victory of 1840 did not produce the happy results anticipated but it is equally true
as we believe
that the unfortunate death of general harrison was the cause of the failure
it was not the election of general harrison that was expected to produce happy effects
but the measures to be adopted by his administration
by means of his death
and the unexpected course of his successor
those measures were never adopted
how could the fruits follow
the consequences we always predicted would follow the failure of those measures have followed
and are now upon us in all their horrors
by the course of mr
tyler the policy of our opponents has continued in operation
still leaving them with the advantage of charging all its evils upon us as the results of a whig administration
let none be deceived by this somewhat plausible
though entirely false charge
if they ask us for the sufficient and sound currency we promised
let them be answered that we only promised it through the medium of a national bank
which they
aided by mr
prevented our establishing
and let them be reminded
that their own policy in relation to the currency has all the time been
and still is
in full operation
let us then again come forth in our might
and by a second victory accomplish that which death prevented in the first
we can do it
when did the whigs ever fail if they were fully aroused and united
even in single states
under such circumstances
defeat seldom overtakes them
call to mind the contested elections within the last few years
and particularly those of moore and letcher from kentucky
newland and graham from north carolina
and the famous new jersey case
in all these districts locofocoism had stalked omnipotent before but when the whole people were aroused by its enormities on those occasions
they put it down
never to rise again
we declare it to be our solemn conviction
that the whigs are always a majority of this nation and that to make them always successful needs but to get them all to the polls and to vote unitedly
this is the great desideratum
let us make every effort to attain it
at every election
let every whig act as though he knew the result to depend upon his action
in the great contest of 1840 some more than twenty one hundred thousand votes were cast
and so surely as there shall be that many
with the ordinary increase added
cast in 1844 that surely will a whig be elected president of the united states

friend bennett
your letter of this day was handed me by mr
it is too late now to effect the object you desire
on yesterday morning the most of the whig members from this district got together and agreed to hold the convention at tremont in tazewell county
i am sorry to hear that any of the whigs of your county
or indeed of any county
should longer be against conventions
on last wednesday evening a meeting of all the whigs then here from all parts of the state was held
and the question of the propriety of conventions was brought up and fully discussed
and at the end of the discussion a resolution recommending the system of conventions to all the whigs of the state was unanimously adopted
other resolutions were also passed
all of which will appear in the next journal
the meeting also appointed a committee to draft an address to the people of the state
which address will also appear in the next journal
in it you will find a brief argument in favor of conventions and although i wrote it myself i will say to you that it is conclusive upon the point and can not be reasonably answered
the right way for you to do is hold your meeting and appoint delegates any how
and if there be any who will not take part
let it be so
the matter will work so well this time that even they who now oppose will come in next time
the convention is to be held at tremont on the 5th of april and according to the rule we have adopted your county is to have delegates being double your representation
if there be any good whig who is disposed to stick out against conventions get him at least to read the arguement in their favor in the address
yours as ever

dear speed
we had a meeting of the whigs of the county here on last monday to appoint delegates to a district convention and baker beat me
and got the delegation instructed to go for him
the meeting
in spite of my attempt to decline it
appointed me one of the delegates so that in getting baker the nomination i shall be fixed a good deal like a fellow who is made a groomsman to a man that has cut him out and is marrying his own dear gal
about the prospects of your having a namesake at our town
can't say exactly yet
to martin m
march 26
friend morris
your letter of the a 3 d
was received on yesterday morning
and for which instead of an excuse
which you thought proper to ask i tender you my sincere thanks
it is truly gratifying to me to learn that
while the people of sangamon have cast me off
my old friends of menard
who have known me longest and best
stick to me
it would astonish
if not amuse
the older citizens to learn that i a stranger
penniless boy
working on a flatboat at ten dollars per month have been put down here as the candidate of pride
and aristocratic family distinction
yet so
it was
there was
the strangest combination of church influence against me
baker is a campbellite and therefore
as i suppose
with few exceptions got all that church
my wife has some relations in the presbyterian churches
and some with the episcopal churches and therefore
wherever it would tell
i was set down as either the one or the other
while it was everywhere contended that no christian ought to go for me
because i belonged to no church
was suspected of being a deist
and had talked about fighting a duel
with all these things
of course
had nothing to do
nor do i complain of them
as to his own church going for him
i think that was right enough
and as to the influences i have spoken of in the other
though they were very strong
it would be grossly untrue and unjust to charge that they acted upon them in a body or were very near so
i only mean that those influences levied a tax of a considerable per cent
upon my strength throughout the religious controversy
but enough of this
you say that in choosing a candidate for congress you have an equal right with sangamon
and in this you are undoubtedly correct
in agreeing to withdraw if the whigs of sangamon should go against me
i did not mean that they alone were worth consulting
but that if she
with her heavy delegation
should be against me
it would be impossible for me to succeed
and therefore i had as well decline
and in relation to menard having rights
permit me fully to recognize them
and to express the opinion that
if she and mason act circumspectly
they will in the convention be able so far to enforce their rights as to decide absolutely which one of the candidates shall be successful
let me show the reason of this
or some other morgan candidate
will get putnam
and logan making sixteen
then you and mason
having three
can give the victory to either side
you say you shall instruct your delegates for me
unless i object
i certainly shall not object
that would be too pleasant a compliment for me to tread in the dust
and besides
if anything should happen which
is not probable by which baker should be thrown out of the fight
i would be at liberty to accept the nomination if i could get it
i do
feel myself bound not to hinder him in any way from getting the nomination
i should despise myself were i to attempt it
i think
it would be proper for your meeting to appoint three delegates and to instruct them to go for some one as the first choice
some one else as a second
and perhaps some one as a third and if in those instructions i were named as the first choice
it would gratify me very much
if you wish to hold the balance of power
it is important for you to attend to and secure the vote of mason also
you should be sure to have men appointed delegates that you know you can safely confide in
if yourself and james short were appointed from your county
all would be safe but whether jim's woman affair a year ago might not be in the way of his appointment is a question
i don't know whether you know it
but i know him to be as honorable a man as there is in the world
you have my permission
and even request
to show this letter to short but to no one else
unless it be a very particular friend who you know will not speak of it
yours as ever
s will you write me again
to martin m
april 14
friend morris
i have heard it intimated that baker has been attempting to get you or miles
or both of you
to violate the instructions of the meeting that appointed you
and to go for him
i have insisted
and still insist
that this cannot be true
surely baker would not do the like
as well might hardin ask me to vote for him in the convention
it is said there will be an attempt to get up instructions in your county requiring you to go for baker
this is all wrong
upon the same rule
why might not i fly from the decision against me in sangamon
and get up instructions to their delegates to go for me
there are at least twelve hundred whigs in the county that took no part
and yet i would as soon put my head in the fire as to attempt it
if any one should get the nomination by such extraordinary means
all harmony in the district would inevitably be lost
honest whigs and very nearly all of them are honest would not quietly abide such enormities
i repeat
such an attempt on baker's part cannot be true
write me at springfield how the matter is
don't show or speak of this letter
lincoln to gen
may 11
friend hardin
butler informs me that he received a letter from you
in which you expressed some doubt whether the whigs of sangamon will support you cordially
you may
at once
dismiss all fears on that subject
we have already resolved to make a particular effort to give you the very largest majority possible in our county
from this
no whig of the county dissents
we have many objects for doing it
we make it a matter of honor and pride to do it we do it because we love the whig cause we do it because we like you personally and last
we wish to convince you that we do not bear that hatred to morgan county that you people have so long seemed to imagine
you will see by the journals of this week that we propose
upon pain of losing a barbecue
to give you twice as great a majority in this county as you shall receive in your own
i got up the proposal
who of the five appointed is to write the district address
i did the labor of writing one address this year
and got thunder for my reward
nothing new here
yours as ever
i wish you would measure one of the largest of those swords we took to alton and write me the length of it
from tip of the point to tip of the hilt
in feet and inches
i have a dispute about the length
state of the union address abraham lincoln december 3
1861 fellow citizens of the senate and house of representatives
in the midst of unprecedented political troubles we have cause of great gratitude to god for unusual good health and most abundant harvests
you will not be surprised to learn that in the peculiar exigencies of the times our intercourse with foreign nations has been attended with profound solicitude
chiefly turning upon our own domestic affairs
a disloyal portion of the american people have during the whole year been engaged in an attempt to divide and destroy the union
a nation which endures factious domestic division is exposed to disrespect abroad
and one party
if not both
is sure sooner or later to invoke foreign intervention
nations thus tempted to interfere are not always able to resist the counsels of seeming expediency and ungenerous ambition
although measures adopted under such influences seldom fail to be unfortunate and injurious to those adopting them
the disloyal citizens of the united states who have offered the ruin of our country in return for the aid and comfort which they have invoked abroad have received less patronage and encouragement than they probably expected
if it were just to suppose
as the insurgents have seemed to assume
that foreign nations in this case
discarding all moral
and treaty obligations
would act solely and selfishly for the most speedy restoration of commerce
including especially the acquisition of cotton
those nations appear as yet not to have seen their way to their object more directly or clearly through the destruction than through the preservation of the union
if we could dare to believe that foreign nations are actuated by no higher principle than this
i am quite sure a sound argument could be made to show them that they can reach their aim more readily and easily by aiding to crush this rebellion than by giving encouragement to it
the principal lever relied on by the insurgents for exciting foreign nations to hostility against us
as already intimated
is the embarrassment of commerce
those nations
not improbably saw from the first that it was the union which made as well our foreign as our domestic commerce
they can scarcely have failed to perceive that the effort for disunion produces the existing difficulty
and that one strong nation promises more durable peace and a more extensive
and reliable commerce than can the same nation broken into hostile fragments
it is not my purpose to review our discussions with foreign states
whatever might be their wishes or dispositions
the integrity of our country and the stability of our government mainly depend not upon them
but on the loyalty
and intelligence of the american people
the correspondence itself
with the usual reservations
is herewith submitted
i venture to hope it will appear that we have practiced prudence and liberality toward foreign powers
averting causes of irritation and with firmness maintaining our own rights and honor
it is apparent that here
as in every other state
foreign dangers necessarily attend domestic difficulties
i recommend that adequate and ample measures be adopted for maintaining the public defenses on every side
while under this general recommendation provision for defending our seacoast line readily occurs to the mind
i also in the same connection ask the attention of congress to our great lakes and rivers
it is believed that some fortifications and depots of arms and munitions
with harbor and navigation improvements
all at well selected points upon these
would be of great importance to the national defense and preservation
i ask attention to the views of the secretary of war
expressed in his report
upon the same general subject
i deem it of importance that the loyal regions of east tennessee and western north carolina should be connected with kentucky and other faithful parts of the union by railroad
i therefore recommend
as a military measure
that congress provide for the construction of such road as speedily as possible
kentucky no doubt will cooperate
and through her legislature make the most judicious selection of a line
the northern terminus must connect with some existing railroad
and whether the route shall be from lexington or nicholasville to the cumberland gap
or from lebanon to the tennessee line
in the direction of knoxville
or on some still different line
can easily be determined
kentucky and the general government cooperating
the work can be completed in a very short time
and when done it will be not only of vast present usefulness
but also a valuable permanent improvement
worth its cost in all the future
some treaties
designed chiefly for the interests of commerce
and having no grave political importance
have been negotiated
and will be submitted to the senate for their consideration
although we have failed to induce some of the commercial powers to adopt a desirable melioration of the rigor of maritime war
we have removed all obstructions from the way of this humane reform except such as are merely of temporary and accidental occurrence
i invite your attention to the correspondence between her britannic majesty's minister accredited to this government and the secretary of state relative to the detention of the british ship perthshire in june last by the united states steamer massachusetts for a supposed breach of the blockade
as this detention was occasioned by an obvious misapprehension of the facts
and as justice requires that we should commit no belligerent act not rounded in strict right as sanctioned by public law
i recommend that an appropriation be made to satisfy the reasonable demand of the owners of the vessel for her detention
i repeat the recommendation of my predecessor in his annual message to congress in december last in regard to the disposition of the surplus which will probably remain after satisfying the claims of american citizens against china
pursuant to the awards of the commissioners under the act of the 3d of march
it should not be deemed advisable to carry that recommendation into effect
i would suggest that authority be given for investing the principal
over the proceeds of the surplus referred to
in good securities
with a view to the satisfaction of such other just claims of our citizens against china as are not unlikely to arise hereafter in the course of our extensive trade with that empire
by the act of the 5th of august last congress authorized the president to instruct the commanders of suitable vessels to defend themselves against and to capture pirates
this authority has been exercised in a single instance only
for the more effectual protection of our extensive and valuable commerce in the eastern seas especially
it seems to me that it would also be advisable to authorize the commanders of sailing vessels to recapture any prizes which pirates may make of united states vessels and their cargoes
and the consular courts now established by law in eastern countries to adjudicate the cases in the event that this should not be objected to by the local authorities
if any good reason exists why we should persevere longer in withholding our recognition of the independence and sovereignty of hayti and liberia
i am unable to discern it
to inaugurate a novel policy in regard to them without the approbation of congress
i submit for your consideration the expediency of an appropriation for maintaining a charge d'affaires near each of those new states
it does not admit of doubt that important commercial advantages might be secured by favorable treaties with them
the operations of the treasury during the period which has elapsed since your adjournment have been conducted with signal success
the patriotism of the people has placed at the disposal of the government the large means demanded by the public exigencies
much of the national loan has been taken by citizens of the industrial classes
whose confidence in their country's faith and zeal for their country's deliverance from present peril have induced them to contribute to the support of the government the whole of their limited acquisitions
this fact imposes peculiar obligations to economy in disbursement and energy in action
the revenue from all sources
including loans
for the financial year ending on the 30th of june
was 86
and the expenditures for the same period
including payments on account of the public debt
were 84
leaving a balance in the treasury on the 1st of july of 52
for the first quarter of the financial year ending on the 30th of september
the receipts from all sources
including the balance of the 1st of july
were 102
and the expenses 98
leaving a balance on the 1st of october
of 4
estimates for the remaining three quarters of the year and for the financial year 1863
together with his views of ways and means for meeting the demands contemplated by them
will be submitted to congress by the secretary of the treasury
it is gratifying to know that the expenditures made necessary by the rebellion are not beyond the resources of the loyal people
and to believe that the same patriotism which has thus far sustained the government will continue to sustain it till peace and union shall again bless the land
i respectfully refer to the report of the secretary of war for information respecting the numerical strength of the army and for recommendations having in view an increase of its efficiency and the well being of the various branches of the service intrusted to his care
it is gratifying to know that the patriotism of the people has proved equal to the occasion
and that the number of troops tendered greatly exceeds the force which congress authorized me to call into the field
i refer with pleasure to those portions of his report which make allusion to the creditable degree of discipline already attained by our troops and to the excellent sanitary condition of the entire army
the recommendation of the secretary for an organization of the militia upon a uniform basis is a subject of vital importance to the future safety of the country
and is commended to the serious attention of congress
the large addition to the regular army
in connection with the defection that has so considerably diminished the number of its officers
gives peculiar importance to his recommendation for increasing the corps of cadets to the greatest capacity of the military academy
by mere omission
i presume
congress has failed to provide chaplains for hospitals occupied by volunteers
this subject was brought to my notice
and i was induced to draw up the form of a letter
one copy of which
properly addressed
has been delivered to each of the persons
and at the dates respectively named and stated in a schedule
containing also the form of the letter marked a
and herewith transmitted
these gentlemen
i understand
entered upon the duties designated at the times respectively stated in the schedule
and have labored faithfully therein ever since
i therefore recommend that they be compensated at the same rate as chaplains in the army
i further suggest that general provision be made for chaplains to serve at hospitals
as well as with regiments
the report of the secretary of the navy presents in detail the operations of that branch of the service
the activity and energy which have characterized its administration
and the results of measures to increase its efficiency and power
such have been the additions
by construction and purchase
that it may almost be said a navy has been created and brought into service since our difficulties commenced
besides blockading our extensive coast
squadrons larger than ever before assembled under our flag have been put afloat and performed deeds which have increased our naval renown
i would invite special attention to the recommendation of the secretary for a more perfect organization of the navy by introducing additional grades in the service
the present organization is defective and unsatisfactory
and the suggestions submitted by the department will
it is believed
if adopted
obviate the difficulties alluded to
promote harmony
and increase the efficiency of the navy
there are three vacancies on the bench of the supreme court two by the decease of justices daniel and mclean and one by the resignation of justice campbell
i have so far forborne making nominations to fill these vacancies for reasons which i will now state
two of the outgoing judges resided within the states now overrun by revolt
so that if successors were appointed in the same localities they could not now serve upon their circuits and many of the most competent men there probably would not take the personal hazard of accepting to serve
even here
upon the supreme bench
i have been unwilling to throw all the appointments northward
thus disabling myself from doing justice to the south on the return of peace although i may remark that to transfer to the north one which has heretofore been in the south would not
with reference to territory and population
be unjust
during the long and brilliant judicial career of judge mclean his circuit grew into an empire altogether too large for any one judge to give the courts therein more than a nominal attendance rising in population from 1
018 in 1830 to 6
405 in 1860
besides this
the country generally has outgrown our present judicial system
if uniformity was at all intended
the system requires that all the states shall be accommodated with circuit courts
attended by supreme judges
in fact
and oregon have never had any such courts
nor can this well be remedied without a change in the system
because the adding of judges to the supreme court
enough for the accommodation of all parts of the country with circuit courts
would create a court altogether too numerous for a judicial body of any sort
and the evil
if it be one
will increase as new states come into the union
circuit courts are useful or they are not useful
if useful
no state should be denied them if not useful
no state should have them
let them be provided for all or abolished as to all
three modifications occur to me
either of which
i think
would be an improvement upon our present system
let the supreme court be of convenient number in every event then
let the whole country be divided into circuits of convenient size
the supreme judges to serve in a number of them corresponding to their own number
and independent circuit judges be provided for all the rest or
let the supreme judges be relieved from circuit duties and circuit judges provided for all the circuits or
dispense with circuit courts altogether
leaving the judicial functions wholly to the district courts and an independent supreme court
i respectfully recommend to the consideration of congress the present condition of the statute laws
with the hope that congress will be able to find an easy remedy for many of the inconveniences and evils which constantly embarrass those engaged in the practical administration of them
since the organization of the government congress has enacted some 5
000 acts and joint resolutions
which fill more than 6
000 closely printed pages and are scattered through many volumes
many of these acts have been drawn in haste and without sufficient caution
so that their provisions are often obscure in themselves or in conflict with each other
or at least so doubtful as to render it very difficult for even the best informed persons to ascertain precisely what the statute law really is
it seems to me very important that the statute laws should be made as plain and intelligible as possible
and be reduced to as small a compass as may consist with the fullness and precision of the will of the legislature and the perspicuity of its language
this well done would
i think
greatly facilitate the labors of those whose duty it is to assist in the administration of the laws
and would be a lasting benefit to the people
by placing before them in a more accessible and intelligible form the laws which so deeply concern their interests and their duties
i am informed by some whose opinions i respect that all the acts of congress now in force and of a permanent and general nature might be revised and rewritten so as to be embraced in one volume or at most two volumes of ordinary and convenient size and i respectfully recommend to congress to consider of the subject
and if my suggestion be approved to devise such plan as to their wisdom shall seem most proper for the attainment of the end proposed
one of the unavoidable consequences of the present insurrection is the entire suppression in many places of all the ordinary means of administering civil justice by the officers and in the forms of existing law
this is the case
in whole or in part
in all the insurgent states and as our armies advance upon and take possession of parts of those states the practical evil becomes more apparent
there are no courts nor officers to whom the citizens of other states may apply for the enforcement of their lawful claims against citizens of the insurgent states
and there is a vast amount of debt constituting such claims
some have estimated it as high as 200
due in large part from insurgents in open rebellion to loyal citizens who are even now making great sacrifices in the discharge of their patriotic duty to support the government
under these circumstances i have been urgently solicited to establish by military power courts to administer summary justice in such cases i have thus far declined to do it
not because i had any doubt that the end proposed the collection of the debts was just and right in itself
but because i have been unwilling to go beyond the pressure of necessity in the unusual exercise of power
but the powers of congress
i suppose
are equal to the anomalous occasion
and therefore i refer the whole matter to congress
with the hope that a plan may be devised for the administration of justice in all such parts of the insurgent states and territories as may be under the control of this government
whether by a voluntary return to allegiance and order or by the power of our arms this
not to be a permanent institution
but a temporary substitute
and to cease as soon as the ordinary courts can be reestablished in peace
it is important that some more convenient means should be provided
if possible
for the adjustment of claims against the government
especially in view of their increased number by reason of the war
it is as much the duty of government to render prompt justice against itself in favor of citizens as it is to administer the same between private individuals
the investigation and adjudication of claims in their nature belong to the judicial department
it is apparent that the attention of congress will be more than usually engaged for some time to come with great national questions
it was intended by the organization of the court of claims mainly to remove this branch of business from the halls of congress
but while the court has proved to be an effective and valuable means of investigation
it in great degree fails to effect the object of its creation for want of power to make its judgments final
fully aware of the delicacy
not to say the danger
of the subject
i commend to your careful consideration whether this power of making judgments final may not properly be given to the court
reserving the right of appeal on questions of law to the supreme court
with such other provisions as experience may have shown to be necessary
i ask attention to the report of the postmaster general
the following being a summary statement of the condition of the department
the revenue from all sources during the fiscal year ending june 30
including the annual permanent appropriation of 700
000 for the transportation of free mail matter
was 9
being about 2 per cent less than the revenue for 1860
the expenditures were 13
showing a decrease of more than 8 per cent as compared with those of the previous year and leaving an excess of expenditure over the revenue for the last fiscal year of 4
the gross revenue for the year ending june 30
is estimated at an increase of 4 per cent on that of 1861
making 8
to which should be added the earnings of the department in carrying free matter
making 9
the total expenditures for 1863 are estimated at 12
leaving an estimated deficiency of 3
000 to be supplied from the treasury in addition to the permanent appropriation
the present insurrection shows
i think
that the extension of this district across the potomac river at the time of establishing the capital here was eminently wise
and consequently that the relinquishment of that portion of it which lies within the state of virginia was unwise and dangerous
i submit for your consideration the expediency of regaining that part of the district and the restoration of the original boundaries thereof through negotiations with the state of virginia
the report of the secretary of the interior
with the accompanying documents
exhibits the condition of the several branches of the public business pertaining to that department
the depressing influences of the insurrection have been specially felt in the operations of the patent and general land offices
the cash receipts from the sales of public lands during the past year have exceeded the expenses of our land system only about 200
the sales have been entirely suspended in the southern states
while the interruptions to the business of the country and the diversion of large numbers of men from labor to military service have obstructed settlements in the new states and territories of the northwest
the receipts of the patent office have declined in nine months about 100
rendering a large reduction of the force employed necessary to make it self sustaining
the demands upon the pension office will be largely increased by the insurrection
numerous applications for pensions
based upon the casualties of the existing war
have already been made
there is reason to believe that many who are now upon the pension rolls and in receipt of the bounty of the government are in the ranks of the insurgent army or giving them aid and comfort
the secretary of the interior has directed a suspension of the payment of the pensions of such persons upon proof of their disloyalty
i recommend that congress authorize that officer to cause the names of such persons to be stricken from the pension rolls
the relations of the government with the indian tribes have been greatly disturbed by the insurrection
especially in the southern superintendency and in that of new mexico
the indian country south of kansas is in the possession of insurgents from texas and arkansas
the agents of the united states appointed since the 4th of march for this superintendency have been unable to reach their posts
while the most of those who were in office before that time have espoused the insurrectionary cause
and assume to exercise the powers of agents by virtue of commissions from the insurrectionists
it has been stated in the public press that a portion of those indians have been organized as a military force and are attached to the army of the insurgents
although the government has no official information upon this subject
letters have been written to the commissioner of indian affairs by several prominent chiefs giving assurance of their loyalty to the united states and expressing a wish for the presence of federal troops to protect them
it is believed that upon the repossession of the country by the federal forces the indians will readily cease all hostile demonstrations and resume their former relations to the government
confessedly the largest interest of the nation
has not a department nor a bureau
but a clerkship only
assigned to it in the government
while it is fortunate that this great interest is so independent in its nature as to not have demanded and extorted more from the government
i respectfully ask congress to consider whether something more can not be given voluntarily with general advantage
annual reports exhibiting the condition of our agriculture
and manufactures would present a fund of information of great practical value to the country
while i make no suggestion as to details
i venture the opinion that an agricultural and statistical bureau might profitably be organized
the execution of the laws for the suppression of the african slave trade has been confided to the department of the interior
it is a subject of gratulation that the efforts which have been made for the suppression of this inhuman traffic have been recently attended with unusual success
five vessels being fitted out for the slave trade have been seized and condemned
two mates of vessels engaged in the trade and one person in equipping a vessel as a slaver have been convicted and subjected to the penalty of fine and imprisonment
and one captain
taken with a cargo of africans on board his vessel
has been convicted of the highest grade of offense under our laws
the punishment of which is death
the territories of colorado
and nevada
created by the last congress
have been organized
and civil administration has been inaugurated therein under auspices especially gratifying when it is considered that the leaven of treason was found existing in some of these new countries when the federal officers arrived there
the abundant natural resources of these territories
with the security and protection afforded by organized government
will doubtless invite to them a large immigration when peace shall restore the business of the country to its accustomed channels
i submit the resolutions of the legislature of colorado
which evidence the patriotic spirit of the people of the territory
so far the authority of the united states has been upheld in all the territories
as it is hoped it will be in the future
i commend their interests and defense to the enlightened and generous care of congress
i recommend to the favorable consideration of congress the interests of the district of columbia
the insurrection has been the cause of much suffering and sacrifice to its inhabitants
and as they have no representative in congress that body should not overlook their just claims upon the government
at your late session a joint resolution was adopted authorizing the president to take measures for facilitating a proper representation of the industrial interests of the united states at the exhibition of the industry of all nations to be holden at london in the year 1862
i regret to say i have been unable to give personal attention to this subject a subject at once so interesting in itself and so extensively and intimately connected with the material prosperity of the world
through the secretaries of state and of the interior a plan or system has been devised and partly matured
and which will be laid before you
under and by virtue of the act of congress entitled an act to confiscate property used for insurrectionary purposes
approved august 6
the legal claims of certain persons to the labor and service of certain other persons have become forfeited
and numbers of the latter thus liberated are already dependent on the united states and must be provided for in some way
besides this
it is not impossible that some of the states will pass similar enactments for their own benefit respectively
and by operation of which persons of the same class will be thrown upon them for disposal
in such case i recommend that congress provide for accepting such persons from such states
according to some mode of valuation
in lieu
pro tanto
of direct taxes
or upon some other plan to be agreed on with such states respectively that such persons
on such acceptance by the general government
be at once deemed free
and that in any event steps be taken for colonizing both classes or the one first mentioned if the other shall not be brought into existence at some place or places in a climate congenial to them
it might be well to consider
whether the free colored people already in the united states could not
so far as individuals may desire
be included in such colonization
to carry out the plan of colonization may involve the acquiring of territory
and also the appropriation of money beyond that to be expended in the territorial acquisition
having practiced the acquisition of territory for nearly sixty years
the question of constitutional power to do so is no longer an open one with us
the power was questioned at first by mr
in the purchase of louisiana
yielded his scruples on the plea of great expediency
if it be said that the only legitimate object of acquiring territory is to furnish homes for white men
this measure effects that object
for the emigration of colored men leaves additional room for white men remaining or coming here
placed the importance of procuring louisiana more on political and commercial grounds than on providing room for population
on this whole proposition
including the appropriation of money with the acquisition of territory
does not the expediency amount to absolute necessity that without which the government itself can not be perpetuated
the war continues
in considering the policy to be adopted for suppressing the insurrection i have been anxious and careful that the inevitable conflict for this purpose shall not degenerate into a violent and remorseless revolutionary struggle
i have therefore in every case thought it proper to keep the integrity of the union prominent as the primary object of the contest on our pan
leaving all questions which are not of vital military importance to the more deliberate action of the legislature
in the exercise of my best discretion i have adhered to the blockade of the ports held by the insurgents
instead of putting in force by proclamation the law of congress enacted
at the late session for closing those ports
so also
obeying the dictates of prudence
as well as the obligations of law
instead of transcending i have adhered to the act of congress to confiscate property used for insurrectionary purposes
if a new law upon the same subject shall be proposed
its propriety will be duly considered
the union must be preserved
and hence all indispensable means must be employed
we should not be in haste to determine that radical and extreme measures
which may reach the loyal as well as the disloyal
are indispensable
the inaugural address at the beginning of the administration and the message to congress at the late special session were both mainly devoted to the domestic controversy out of which the insurrection and consequent war have sprung
nothing now occurs to add or subtract to or from the principles or general purposes stated and expressed in those documents
the last ray of hope for preserving the union peaceably expired at the assault upon fort sumter
and a general review of what has occurred since may not be unprofitable
what was painfully uncertain then is much better defined and more distinct now
and the progress of events is plainly in the right direction
the insurgents confidently claimed a strong support from north of mason and dixon's line
and the friends of the union were not free from apprehension on the point
was soon settled definitely
and on the right side
south of the line noble little delaware led off right from the first
maryland was made to seem against the union
our soldiers were assaulted
bridges were burned
and railroads torn up within her limits
and we were many days at one time without the ability to bring a single regiment over her soil to the capital
now her bridges and railroads are repaired and open to the government she already gives seven regiments to the cause of the union
and none to the enemy and her people
at a regular election
have sustained the union by a larger majority and a larger aggregate vote than they ever before gave to any candidate or any question
for some time in doubt
is now decidedly and
i think
unchangeably ranged on the side of the union
missouri is comparatively quiet
i believe
can not again be overrun by the insurrectionists
these three states of maryland
and missouri
neither of which would promise a single soldier at first
have now an aggregate of not less than 40
000 in the field for the union
while of their citizens certainly not more than a third of that number
and they of doubtful whereabouts and doubtful existence
are in arms against us
after a somewhat bloody struggle of months
winter closes on the union people of western virginia
leaving them masters of their own country
an insurgent force of about 1
for months dominating the narrow peninsular region constituting the counties of accomac and northampton
and known as eastern shore of virginia
together with some contiguous parts of maryland
have laid down their arms
and the people there have renewed their allegiance to and accepted the protection of the old flag
this leaves no armed insurrectionist north of the potomac or east of the chesapeake
also we have obtained a footing at each of the isolated points on the southern coast of hatteras
port royal
tybee island near savannah
and ship island and we likewise have some general accounts of popular movements in behalf of the union in north carolina and tennessee
these things demonstrate that the cause of the union is advancing steadily and certainly southward
since your last adjournment lieutenant general scott has retired from the head of the army
during his long life the nation has not been unmindful of his merit yet on calling to mind how faithfully
and brilliantly he has served the country
from a time far back in our history
when few of the now living had been born
and thenceforward continually
i can not but think we are still his debtors
i submit
for your consideration what further mark of recognition is due to him
and to ourselves as a grateful people
with the retirement of general scott came the executive duty of appointing in his stead a general in chief of the army
it is a fortunate circumstance that neither in council nor country was there
so far as i know
any difference of opinion as to the proper person to be selected
the retiring chief repeatedly expressed his judgment in favor of general mcclellan for the position
and in this the nation seemed to give a unanimous concurrence
the designation of general mcclellan is therefore in considerable degree the selection of the country as well as of the executive
and hence there is better reason to hope there will be given him the confidence and cordial support thus by fair implication promised
and without which he can not with so full efficiency serve the country
it has been said that one bad general is better than two good ones
and the saying is true if taken to mean no more than that an army is better directed by a single mind
though inferior
than by two superior ones at variance and cross purposes with each other
and the same is true in all joint operations wherein those engaged can have none but a common end in view and can differ only as to the choice of means
in a storm at sea no one on board can wish the ship to sink
and yet not unfrequently all go down together because too many will direct and no single mind can be allowed to control
it continues to develop that the insurrection is largely
if not exclusively
a war upon the first principle of popular government the rights of the people
conclusive evidence of this is found in the most grave and maturely considered public documents
as well as in the general tone of the insurgents
in those documents we find the abridgment of the existing right of suffrage and the denial to the people of all right to participate in the selection of public officers except the legislative boldly advocated
with labored arguments to prove that large control of the people in government is the source of all political evil
monarchy itself is sometimes hinted at as a possible refuge from the power of the people
in my present position i could scarcely be justified were i to omit raising a warning voice against this approach of returning despotism
it is not needed nor fitting here that a general argument should be made in favor of popular institutions
but there is one point
with its connections
not so hackneyed as most others
to which i ask a brief attention
it is the effort to place capital on an equal footing with
if not above
labor in the structure of government
it is assumed that labor is available only in connection with capital that nobody labors unless somebody else
owning capital
somehow by the use of it induces him to labor
this assumed
it is next considered whether it is best that capital shall hire laborers
and thus induce them to work by their own consent
or buy them and drive them to it without their consent
having proceeded so far
it is naturally concluded that all laborers are either hired laborers or what we call slaves
and further
it is assumed that whoever is once a hired laborer is fixed in that condition for life
now there is no such relation between capital and labor as assumed
nor is there any such thing as a free man being fixed for life in the condition of a hired laborer
both these assumptions are false
and all inferences from them are groundless
labor is prior to and independent of capital
capital is only the fruit of labor
and could never have existed if labor had not first existed
labor is the superior of capital
and deserves much the higher consideration
capital has its rights
which are as worthy of protection as any other rights
nor is it denied that there is
and probably always will be
a relation between labor and capital producing mutual benefits
the error is in assuming that the whole labor of community exists within that relation
a few men own capital
and that few avoid labor themselves
and with their capital hire or buy another few to labor for them
a large majority belong to neither class neither work for others nor have others working for them
in most of the southern states a majority of the whole people of all colors are neither slaves nor masters
while in the northern a large majority are neither hirers nor hired
with their families wives
and daughters work for themselves on their farms
in their houses
and in their shops
taking the whole product to themselves
and asking no favors of capital on the one hand nor of hired laborers or slaves on the other
it is not forgotten that a considerable number of persons mingle their own labor with capital that is
they labor with their own hands and also buy or hire others to labor for them but this is only a mixed and not a distinct class
no principle stated is disturbed by the existence of this mixed class
as has already been said
there is not of necessity any such thing as the free hired laborer being fixed to that condition for life
many independent men everywhere in these states a few years back in their lives were hired laborers
the prudent
penniless beginner in the world labors for wages awhile
saves a surplus with which to buy tools or land for himself
then labors on his own account another while
and at length hires another new beginner to help him
this is the just and generous and prosperous system which opens the way to all
gives hope to all
and consequent energy and progress and improvement of condition to all
no men living are more worthy to be trusted than those who toil up from poverty none less inclined to take or touch aught which they have not honestly earned
let them beware of surrendering a political power which they already possess
and which if surrendered will surely be used to close the door of advancement against such as they and to fix new disabilities and burdens upon them till all of liberty shall be lost
from the first taking of our national census to the last are seventy years
and we find our population at the end of the period eight times as great as it was at the beginning
the increase of those other things which men deem desirable has been even greater
we thus have at one view what the popular principle
applied to government through the machinery
of the states and the union
has produced in a given time
and also what if firmly maintained it promises for the future
there are already among us those who if the union be preserved will live to see it contain 250
the struggle of to day is not altogether for to day it is for a vast future also
with a reliance on providence all the more firm and earnest
let us proceed in the great task which events have devolved upon us
state of the union address abraham lincoln december 1
1862 fellow citizens of the senate and house of representatives
since your last annual assembling another year of health and bountiful harvests has passed
and while it has not pleased the almighty to bless us with a return of peace
we can but press on
guided by the best light he gives us
trusting that in his own good time and wise way all will yet be well
the correspondence touching foreign affairs which has taken place during the last year is herewith submitted
in virtual compliance with a request to that effect made by the house of representatives near the close of the last session of congress
if the condition of our relations with other nations is less gratifying than it has usually been at former periods
it is certainly more satisfactory than a nation so unhappily distracted as we are might reasonably have apprehended
in the month of june last there were some grounds to expect that the maritime powers which at the beginning of our domestic difficulties so unwisely and unnecessarily
as we think
recognized the insurgents as a belligerent would soon recede from that position
which has proved only less injurious to themselves than to our own country
but the temporary reverses which afterwards befell the national arms
and which were exaggerated by our own disloyal citizens abroad
have hitherto delayed that act of simple justice
the civil war
which has so radically changed for the moment the occupations and habits of the american people
has necessarily disturbed the social condition and affected very deeply the prosperity of the nations with which we have carried on a commerce that has been steadily increasing throughout a period of half a century
it has at the same time excited political ambitions and apprehensions which have produced a profound agitation throughout the civilized world
in this unusual agitation we have forborne from taking part in any controversy between foreign states and between parties or factions in such states
we have attempted no propagandism and acknowledged no revolution
but we have left to every nation the exclusive conduct and management of its own affairs
our struggle has been
of course
contemplated by foreign nations with reference less to its own merits than to its supposed and often exaggerated effects and consequences resulting to those nations themselves
complaint on the part of this government
even if it were just
would certainly be unwise
the treaty with great britain for the suppression of the slave trade has been put into operation with a good prospect of complete success
it is an occasion of special pleasure to acknowledge that the execution of it on the part of her majesty's government has been marked with a jealous respect for the authority of the united states and the rights of their moral and loyal citizens
the convention with hanover for the abolition of the stade dues has been carried into full effect under the act of congress for that purpose
a blockade of 3
000 miles of seacoast could not be established and vigorously enforced in a season of great commercial activity like the present without committing occasional mistakes and inflicting unintentional injuries upon foreign nations and their subjects
a civil war occurring in a country
where foreigners reside and carry on trade under treaty stipulations is necessarily fruitful of complaints of the violation of neutral rights
all such collisions tend to excite misapprehensions
and possibly to produce mutual reclamations between nations which have a common interest in preserving peace and friendship
in clear cases of these kinds i have so far as possible heard and redressed complaints which have been presented by friendly powers
there is still
a large and an augmenting number of doubtful cases upon which the government is unable to agree with the governments whose protection is demanded by the claimants
there are
many cases in which the united states or their citizens suffer wrongs from the naval or military authorities of foreign nations which the governments of those states are not at once prepared to redress
i have proposed to some of the foreign states thus interested mutual conventions to examine and adjust such complaints
this proposition has been made especially to great britain
to france
to spain
and to prussia
in each case it has been kindly received
but has not yet been formally adopted
i deem it my duty to recommend an appropriation in behalf of the owners of the norwegian bark admiral p
which vessel was in may
prevented by the commander of the blockading force off charleston from leaving that port with cargo
notwithstanding a similar privilege had shortly before been granted to an english vessel
i have directed the secretary of state to cause the papers in the case to be communicated to the proper committees
applications have been made to me by many free americans of african descent to favor their emigration
with a view to such colonization as was contemplated in recent acts of congress
other parties
at home and abroad some from interested motives
others upon patriotic considerations
and still others influenced by philanthropic sentiments have suggested similar measures
on the other hand
several of the spanish american republics have protested against the sending of such colonies to their respective territories
under these circumstances i have declined to move any such colony to any state without first obtaining the consent of its government
with an agreement on its part to receive and protect such emigrants in all the rights of freemen and i have at the same time offered to the several states situated within the tropics
or having colonies there
to negotiate with them
subject to the advice and consent of the senate
to favor the voluntary emigration of persons of that class to their respective territories
upon conditions which shall be equal
and humane
liberia and hayti are as yet the only countries to which colonists of african descent from here could go with certainty of being received and adopted as citizens and i regret to say such persons contemplating colonization do not seem so willing to migrate to those countries as to some others
nor so willing as i think their interest demands
i believe
opinion among them in this respect is improving
and that ere long there will be an augmented and considerable migration to both these countries from the united states
the new commercial treaty between the united states and the sultan of turkey has been carried into execution
a commercial and consular treaty has been negotiated
subject to the senate's consent
with liberia
and a similar negotiation is now pending with the republic of hayti
a considerable improvement of the national commerce is expected to result from these measures
our relations with great britain
the netherlands
and the other european states remain undisturbed
very favorable relations also continue to be maintained with turkey
and japan
during the last year there has not only been no change of our previous relations with the independent states of our own continent
but more friendly sentiments than have heretofore existed are believed to be entertained by these neighbors
whose safety and progress are so intimately connected with our own
this statement especially applies to mexico
costa rica
and chile
the commission under the convention with the republic of new granada closed its session without having audited and passed upon all the claims which were submitted to it
a proposition is pending to revive the convention
that it may be able to do more complete justice
the joint commission between the united states and the republic of costa rica has completed its labors and submitted its report
i have favored the project for connecting the united states with europe by an atlantic telegraph
and a similar project to extend the telegraph from san francisco to connect by a pacific telegraph with the line which is being extended across the russian empire
the territories of the united states
with unimportant exceptions have remained undisturbed by the civil war and they are exhibiting such evidence of prosperity as justifies an expectation that some of them will soon be in a condition to be organized as states and be constitutionally admitted into the federal union
the immense mineral resources of some of those territories ought to be developed as rapidly as possible
every step in that direction would have a tendency to improve the revenues of the government and diminish the burdens of the people
it is worthy of your serious consideration whether some extraordinary measures to promote that end can not be adopted
the means which suggests itself as most likely to be effective is a scientific exploration of the mineral regions in those territories with a view to the publication of its results at home and in foreign countries results which can not fail to be auspicious
the condition of the finances will claim your most diligent consideration
the vast expenditures incident to the military and naval operations required for the suppression of the rebellion have hitherto been met with a promptitude and certainty unusual in similar circumstances
and the public credit has been fully maintained
the continuance of the war
and the increased disbursements made necessary by the augmented forces now in the field demand your best reflections as to the best modes of providing the necessary revenue without injury to business and with the least possible burdens upon labor
the suspension of specie payments by the banks soon after the commencement of your last session made large issues of united states notes unavoidable
in no other way could the payment of the troops and the satisfaction of other just demands be so economically or so well provided for
the judicious legislation of congress
securing the receivability of these notes for loans and internal duties and making them a legal tender for other debts
has made them an universal currency
and has satisfied
partially at least
and for the time
the long felt want of an uniform circulating medium
saving thereby to the people immense sums in discounts and exchanges
a return to specie payments
at the earliest period compatible with due regard to all interests concerned should ever be kept in view
fluctuations in the value of currency are always injurious
and to reduce these fluctuations to the lowest possible point will always be a leading purpose in wise legislation
prompt and certain convertibility
into coin is generally acknowledged to be the best and surest safeguard against them and it is extremely doubtful whether a circulation of united states notes payable in coin and sufficiently large for the wants of the people can be permanently
and safely maintained
is there
any other mode in which the necessary provision for the public wants can be made and the great advantages of a safe and uniform currency secured
i know of none which promises so certain results and is at the same time so unobjectionable as the organization of banking associations
under a general act of congress
well guarded in its provisions
to such associations the government might furnish circulating notes
on the security of united states bonds deposited in the treasury
these notes
prepared under the supervision of proper officers
being uniform in appearance and security and convertible always into coin
would at once protect labor against the evils of a vicious currency and facilitate commerce by cheap and safe exchanges
a moderate reservation from the interest on the bonds would compensate the united states for the preparation and distribution of the notes and a general supervision of the system
and would lighten the burden of that part of the public debt employed as securities
the public credit
would be greatly improved and the negotiation of new loans greatly facilitated by the steady market demand for government bonds which the adoption of the proposed system would create
it is an additional recommendation of the measure
of considerable weight
in my judgment
that it would reconcile as far as possible all existing interests by the opportunity offered to existing institutions to reorganize under the act
substituting only the secured uniform national circulation for the local and various circulation
secured and unsecured
now issued by them
the receipts into the treasury from all sources
including loans and balance from the preceding year
for the fiscal year ending on the 30th june
were 583
of which sum 49
62 were derived from customs 1
73 from the direct tax from public lands
77 from miscellaneous sources
64 from loans in all forms
the remainder
was the balance from last year
the disbursements during the same period were
for congressional
and judicial purposes
29 for foreign intercourse
35 for miscellaneous expenses
including the mints
post office deficiencies
collection of revenue
and other like charges
50 for expenses under the interior department
52 under the war department
36 under the navy department
69 for interest on public debt
45 and for payment of public debt
including reimbursement of temporary loan and redemptions
09 making an aggregate of 570
and leaving a balance in the treasury on the 1st day of july
of 13
it should be observed that the sum of 96
expended for reimbursements and redemption of public debt
being included also in the loans made
may be properly deducted both from receipts and expenditures
leaving the actual receipts for the year 487
and the expenditures 474
other information on the subject of the finances will be found in the report of the secretary of the treasury
to whose statements and views i invite your most candid and considerate attention
the reports of the secretaries of war and of the navy are herewith transmitted
these reports
though lengthy
are scarcely more than brief abstracts of the very numerous and extensive transactions and operations conducted through those departments
nor could i give a summary of them here upon any principle which would admit of its being much shorter than the reports themselves
i therefore content myself with laying the reports before you and asking your attention to them
it gives me pleasure to report a decided improvement in the financial condition of the post office department as compared with several preceding years
the receipts for the fiscal year 1861 amounted to 8
which embraced the revenue from all the states of the union for three quarters of that year
notwithstanding the cessation of revenue from the so called seceded states during the last fiscal year
the increase of the correspondence of the loyal states has been sufficient to produce a revenue during the same year of 8
being only 50
000 less than was derived from all the states of the union during the previous year
the expenditures show a still more favorable result
the amount expended in 1861 was 13
for the last year the amount has been reduced to 11
showing a decrease of about 2
000 in the expenditures as compared with the preceding year
and about 3
000 as compared with the fiscal year 1860
the deficiency in the department for the previous year was 4
for the last fiscal year it was reduced to 2
these favorable results are in part owing to the cessation of mail service in the insurrectionary states and in part to a careful review of all expenditures in that department in the interest of economy
the efficiency of the postal service
it is believed
has also been much improved
the postmaster general has also opened a correspondence through the department of state with foreign governments proposing a convention of postal representatives for the purpose of simplifying the rates of foreign postage and to expedite the foreign mails
this proposition
equally important to our adopted citizens and to the commercial interests of this country
has been favorably entertained and agreed to by all the governments from whom replies have been received
i ask the attention of congress to the suggestions of the postmaster general in his report respecting the further legislation required
in his opinion
for the benefit of the postal service
the secretary of the interior reports as follows in regard to the public lands
the public lands have ceased to be a source of revenue
from the 1st july
to the 30th september
the entire cash receipts from the sale of lands were 137
26 a sum much less than the expenses of our land system during the same period
the homestead law
which will take effect on the 1st of january next
offers such inducements to settlers that sales for cash can not be expected to an extent sufficient to meet the expenses of the general land office and the cost of surveying and bringing the land into market
the discrepancy between the sum here stated as arising from the sales of the public lands and the sum derived from the same source as reported from the treasury department arises
as i understand
from the fact that the periods of time
though apparently
were not really coincident at the beginning point
the treasury report including a considerable sum now which had previously been reported from the interior
sufficiently large to greatly overreach the sum derived from the three months now reported upon by the interior and not by the treasury
the indian tribes upon our frontiers have during the past year manifested a spirit of insubordination
and at several points have engaged in open hostilities against the white settlements in their vicinity
the tribes occupying the indian country south of kansas renounced their allegiance to the united states and entered into treaties with the insurgents
those who remained loyal to the united states were driven from the country
the chief of the cherokees has visited this city for the purpose of restoring the former relations of the tribe with the united states
he alleges that they were constrained by superior force to enter into treaties with the insurgents
and that the united states neglected to furnish the protection which their treaty stipulations required
in the month of august last the sioux indians in minnesota attacked the settlements in their vicinity with extreme ferocity
killing indiscriminately men
and children
this attack was wholly unexpected
and therefore no means of defense had been prodded
it is estimated that not less than 800 persons were killed by the indians
and a large amount of property was destroyed
how this outbreak was induced is not definitely known
and suspicions
which may be unjust
need not to be stated
information was received by the indian bureau from different sources about the time hostilities were commenced that a simultaneous attack was to be made upon the white settlements by all the tribes between the mississippi river and the rocky mountains
the state of minnesota has suffered great injury from this indian war
a large portion of her territory has been depopulated
and a severe loss has been sustained by the destruction of property
the people of that state manifest much anxiety for the removal of the tribes beyond the limits of the state as a guaranty against future hostilities
the commissioner of indian affairs will furnish full details
i submit for your especial consideration whether our indian system shall not be remodeled
many wise and good men have impressed me with the belief that this can be profitably done
i submit a statement of the proceedings of commissioners
which shows the progress that has been made in the enterprise of constructing the pacific railroad
and this suggests the earliest completion of this road
and also the favorable action of congress upon the projects now pending before them for enlarging the capacities of the great canals in new york and illinois
as being of vital and rapidly increasing importance to the whole nation
and especially to the vast interior region hereinafter to be noticed at some greater length
i purpose having prepared and laid before you at an early day some interesting and valuable statistical information upon this subject
the military and commercial importance of enlarging the illinois and michigan canal and improving the illinois river is presented in the report of colonel webster to the secretary of war
and now transmitted to congress
i respectfully ask attention to it
to carry out the provisions of the act of congress of the 15th of may last
i have caused the department of agriculture of the united states to be organized
the commissioner informs me that within the period of a few months this department has established an extensive system of correspondence and exchanges
both at home and abroad
which promises to effect highly beneficial results in the development of a correct knowledge of recent improvements in agriculture
in the introduction of new products
and in the collection of the agricultural statistics of the different states
that it will soon be prepared to distribute largely seeds
and cuttings
and has already published and liberally diffused much valuable information in anticipation of a more elaborate report
which will in due time be furnished
embracing some valuable tests in chemical science now in progress in the laboratory
the creation of this department was for the more immediate benefit of a large class of our most valuable citizens
and i trust that the liberal basis upon which it has been organized will not only meet your approbation
but that it will realize at no distant day all the fondest anticipations of its most sanguine friends and become the fruitful source of advantage to all our people
on the 22d day of september last a proclamation was issued by the executive
a copy of which is herewith submitted
in accordance with the purpose expressed in the second paragraph of that paper
i now respectfully recall your attention to what may be called compensated emancipation
a nation may be said to consist of its territory
its people
and its laws
the territory is the only part which is of certain durability
one generation passeth away and another generation cometh
but the earth abideth forever
it is of the first importance to duly consider and estimate this ever enduring part
that portion of the earth's surface which is owned and inhabited by the people of the united states is well adapted to be the home of one national family
and it is not well adapted for two or more
its vast extent and its variety of climate and productions are of advantage in this age for one people
whatever they might have been in former ages
and intelligence have brought these to be an advantageous combination for one united people
in the inaugural address i briefly pointed out the total inadequacy of disunion as a remedy for the differences between the people of the two sections
i did so in language which i can not improve
and which
i beg to repeat
one section of our country believes slavery is right and ought to be extended
while the other believes it is wrong and ought not to be extended
this is the only substantial dispute
the fugitive slave clause of the constitution and the law for the suppression of the foreign slave trade are each as well enforced
as any law can ever be in a community where the moral sense of the people imperfectly supports the law itself
the great body of the people abide by the dry legal obligation in both cases
and a few break over in each
this i think
can not be perfectly cured
and it would be worse in both cases after the separation of the sections than before
the foreign slave trade
now imperfectly suppressed
would be ultimately revived without restriction in one section
while fugitive slaves
now only partially surrendered
would not be surrendered at all by the other
physically speaking
we can not separate
we can not remove our respective sections from each other nor build an impassable wall between them
a husband and wife may be divorced and go out of the presence and beyond the reach of each other
but the different parts of our country can not do this
they can not but remain face to face
and intercourse
either amicable or hostile
must continue between them
is it possible
to make that intercourse more advantageous or more satisfactory after separation than before
can aliens make treaties easier than friends can make laws
can treaties be more faithfully enforced between aliens than laws can among friends
suppose you go to war
you can not fight always and when
after much loss on both sides and no gain on either
you cease fighting
the identical old questions
as to terms of intercourse
are again upon you
there is no line
straight or crooked
suitable for a national boundary upon which to divide
trace through
from east to west
upon the line between the free and slave country
and we shall find a little more than one third of its length are rivers
easy to be crossed
and populated
or soon to be populated
thickly upon both sides while nearly all its remaining length are merely surveyors' lines
over which people may walk back and forth without any consciousness of their presence
no part of this line can be made any more difficult to pass by writing it down on paper or parchment as a national boundary
the fact of separation
if it comes
gives up on the part of the seceding section the fugitive slave clause
along with all other constitutional obligations upon the section seceded from
while i should expect no treaty stipulation would ever be made to take its place
but there is another difficulty
the great interior region bounded east by the alleghanies
north by the british dominions
west by the rocky mountains
and south by the line along which the culture of corn and cotton meets
and which includes part of virginia
part of tennessee
all of kentucky
and the territories of dakota
and part of colorado
already has above 10
000 people
and will have 50
000 within fifty years if not prevented by any political folly or mistake
it contains more than one third of the country owned by the united states certainly more than 1
000 square miles
once half as populous as massachusetts already is
it would have more than 75
000 people
a glance at the map shows that
territorially speaking
it is the great body of the republic
the other parts are but marginal borders to it
the magnificent region sloping west from the rocky mountains to the pacific being the deepest and also the richest in undeveloped resources
in the production of provisions grains
and all which proceed from them this great interior region is naturally one of the most important in the world
ascertain from the statistics the small proportion of the region which has as yet been brought into cultivation
and also the large and rapidly increasing amount of its products
and we shall be overwhelmed with the magnitude of the prospect presented
and yet this region has no seacoast touches no ocean anywhere
as part of one nation
its people now find
and may forever find
their way to europe by new york
to south america and africa by new orleans
and to asia by san francisco but separate our common country into two nations
as designed by the present rebellion
and every man of this great interior region is thereby cut off from some one or more of these outlets
not perhaps by a physical barrier
but by embarrassing and onerous trade regulations
and this is true
wherever a dividing or boundary line may be fixed
place it between the now free and slave country
or place it south of kentucky or north of ohio
and still the truth remains that none south of it can trade to any port or place north of it
and none north of it can trade to any port or place south of it
except upon terms dictated by a government foreign to them
these outlets
and south
are indispensable to the well being of the people inhabiting and to inhabit this vast interior region
which of the three may be the best is no proper question
all are better than either
and all of right belong to that people and to their successors forever
true to themselves
they will not ask where a line of separation shall be
but will vow rather that there shall be no such line
nor are the marginal regions less interested in these communications to and through them to the great outside world
and each of them
must have access to this egypt of the west without paying toll at the crossing of any national boundary
our national strife springs not from our permanent part not from the land we inhabit
not from our national homestead
there is no possible severing of this but would multiply and not mitigate evils among us
in all its adaptations and aptitudes it demands union and abhors separation
in fact
it would ere long force reunion
however much of blood and treasure the separation might have cost
our strife pertains to ourselves to the passing generations of men and it can without convulsion be hushed forever with the passing of one generation
in this view i recommend the adoption of the following resolution and articles amendatory to the constitution of the united states
resolved by the senate and house of representatives of the united states of america in congress assembled two thirds of both houses concurring
that the following articles be proposed to the legislatures or conventions of the several states as amendments to the constitution of the united states
all or any of which articles
when ratified by three fourths of the said legislatures or conventions
to be valid as part or parts of the said constitution
every state wherein slavery now exists which shall abolish the same therein at any time or times before the 1st day of january
shall receive compensation from the united states as follows
to wit
the president of the united states shall deliver to every such state bonds of the united states bearing interest at the rate of per cent per annum to an amount equal to the aggregate sum of for each slave shown to have been therein by the eighth census of the united states
said bonds to be delivered to such state by installments or in one parcel at the completion of the abolishment
accordingly as the same shall have been gradual or at one time within such state and interest shall begin to run upon any such bond only from the proper time of its delivery as aforesaid
any state having received bonds as aforesaid and afterwards reintroducing or tolerating slavery therein shall refund to the united states the bonds so received
or the value thereof
and all interest paid thereon
all slaves who shall have enjoyed actual freedom by the chances of the war at any time before the end of the rebellion shall be forever free but all owners of such who shall not have been disloyal shall be compensated for them at the same rates as is provided for states adopting abolishment of slavery
but in such way that no slave shall be twice accounted for
congress may appropriate money and otherwise provide for colonizing free colored persons with their own consent at any place or places without the united states
i beg indulgence to discuss these proposed articles at some length
without slavery the rebellion could never have existed without slavery it could not continue
among the friends of the union there is great diversity of sentiment and of policy in regard to slavery and the african race amongst us
some would perpetuate slavery some would abolish it suddenly and without compensation some would abolish it gradually and with compensation
some would remove the freed people from us
and some would retain them with us and there are yet other minor diversities
because of these diversities we waste much strength in struggles among ourselves
by mutual concession we should harmonize and act together
this would be compromise
but it would be compromise among the friends and not with the enemies of the union
these articles are intended to embody a plan of such mutual concessions
if the plan shall be adopted
it is assumed that emancipation will follow
at least in several of the states
as to the first article
the main points are
the emancipation secondly
the length of time for consummating it thirty seven years and
the compensation
the emancipation will be unsatisfactory to the advocates of perpetual slavery
but the length of time should greatly mitigate their dissatisfaction
the time spares both races from the evils of sudden derangement in fact
from the necessity of any derangement while most of those whose habitual course of thought will be disturbed by the measure will have passed away before its consummation
they will never see it
another class will hail the prospect of emancipation
but will deprecate the length of time
they will feel that it gives too little to the now living slaves
but it really gives them much
it saves them from the vagrant destitution which must largely attend immediate emancipation in localities where their numbers are very great
and it gives the inspiring assurance that their posterity shall be free forever
the plan leaves to each state choosing to act under it to abolish slavery now or at the end of the century
or at any intermediate time
or by degrees extending over the whole or any part of the period
and it obliges no two states to proceed alike
it also provides for compensation
and generally the mode of making it
it would seem
must further mitigate the dissatisfaction of those who favor perpetual slavery
and especially of those who are to receive the compensation
doubtless some of those who are to pay and not to receive will object
yet the measure is both just and economical
in a certain sense the liberation of slaves is the destruction of property property acquired by descent or by purchase
the same as any other property
it is no less true for having been often said that the people of the south are not more responsible for the original introduction of this property than are the people of the north and when it is remembered how unhesitatingly we all use cotton and sugar and share the profits of dealing in them
it may not be quite safe to say that the south has been more responsible than the north for its continuance
for a common object this property is to be sacrificed
is it not just that it be done at a common charge
and if with less money
or money more easily paid
we can preserve the benefits of the union by this means than we can by the war alone
is it not also economical to do it
let us consider it
let us ascertain the sum we have expended in the war since compensated emancipation was proposed last march
and consider whether if that measure had been promptly accepted by even some of the slave states the same sum would not have done more to close the war than has been otherwise done
if so
the measure would save money
and in that view would be a prudent and economical measure
certainly it is not so easy to pay something as it is to pay nothing
but it is easier to pay a large sum than it is to pay a larger one
and it is easier to pay any sum when we are able than it is to pay it before we are able
the war requires large sums
and requires them at once
the aggregate sum necessary for compensated emancipation of course would be large
but it would require no ready cash
nor the bonds even any faster than the emancipation progresses
this might not
and probably would not
close before the end of the thirty seven years
at that time we shall probably have a hundred millions of people to share the burden
instead of thirty one millions as now
and not only so
but the increase of our population may be expected to continue for a long time after that period as rapidly as before
because our territory will not have become full
i do not state this inconsiderately
at the same ratio of increase which we have maintained
on an average
from our first national census
in 1790
until that of 1860
we should in 1900 have a population of 103
and why may we not continue that ratio far beyond that period
our abundant room
our broad national homestead
is our ample resource
were our territory as limited as are the british isles
very certainly our population could not expand as stated
instead of receiving the foreign born as now
we should be compelled to send part of the native born away
but such is not our condition
we have 2
000 square miles
europe has 3
with a population averaging 73 1 3 persons to the square mile
why may not our country at some time average as many
is it less fertile
has it more waste surface by mountains
or other causes
is it inferior to europe in any natural advantage
we are at some time to be as populous as europe
how soon
as to when this may be
we can judge by the past and the present as to when it will be
if ever
depends much on whether we maintain the union
several of our states are already above the average of europe 73 1 3 to the square mile
massachusetts has 157 rhode island
133 connecticut
99 new york and new jersey
each 80
also two other great states
pennsylvania and ohio
are not far below
the former having 63 and the latter 59
the states already above the european average
except new york
have increased in as rapid a ratio since passing that point as ever before
while no one of them is equal to some other parts of our country in natural capacity for sustaining a dense population
taking the nation in the aggregate
and we find its population and ratio of increase for the several decennial periods to be as follows
year population ratio of increase
per cent
1790 3
827
1800 5
937 35
02 1810 7
814 36
45 1820 9
131 36
45 1830 12
020 33
49 1840 17
453 32
67 1850 23
876 35
87 1860 31
790 35
58 this shows an average decennial increase of 34
60 per cent in population through the seventy years from our first to our last census yet taken
it is seen that the ratio of increase at no one of these seven periods is either 2 per cent below or 2 per cent above the average
thus showing how inflexible
and consequently how reliable
the law of increase in our case is
assuming that it will continue
it gives the following results
year population 1870 42
341 1880 56
216 1890 76
872 1900 103
415 1910 138
526 1920 186
335 1930 251
914 these figures show that our country may be as populous as europe now is at some point between 1920 and 1930 say about 1925 our territory
at 73 1 3 persons to the square mile
being of capacity to contain 217
and we will reach this
if we do not ourselves relinquish the chance by the folly and evils of disunion or by long and exhausting war springing from the only great element of national discord among us
while it can not be foreseen exactly how much one huge example of secession
breeding lesser ones indefinitely
would retard population
and prosperity
no one can doubt that the extent of it would be very great and injurious
the proposed emancipation would shorten the war
perpetuate peace
insure this increase of population
and proportionately the wealth of the country
with these we should pay all the emancipation would cost
together with our other debt
easier than we should pay our other debt without it
if we had allowed our old national debt to run at 6 per cent per annum
simple interest
from the end of our revolutionary struggle until to day
without paying anything on either principal or interest
each man of us would owe less upon that debt now than each man owed upon it then and this because our increase of men through the whole period has been greater than 6 per cent has run faster than the interest upon the debt
thus time alone relieves a debtor nation
so long as its population increases faster than unpaid interest accumulates on its debt
this fact would be no excuse for delaying payment of what is justly due
but it shows the great importance of time in this connection the great advantage of a policy by which we shall not have to pay until we number 100
000 what by a different policy we would have to pay now
when we number but 31
in a word
it shows that a dollar will be much harder to pay for the war than will be a dollar for emancipation on the proposed plan
and then the latter will cost no blood
no precious life
it will be a saving of both
as to the second article
i think it would be impracticable to return to bondage the class of persons therein contemplated
some of them
in the property sense belong to loyal owners
and hence provision is made in this article for compensating such
the third article relates to the future of the freed people
it does not oblige
but merely authorizes congress to aid in colonizing such as may consent
this ought not to be regarded as objectionable on the one hand or on the other
insomuch as it comes to nothing unless by the mutual consent of the people to be deported and the american voters
through their representatives in congress
i can not make it better known than it already is that i strongly favor colonization and yet i wish to say there is an objection urged against free colored persons remaining in the country which is largely imaginary
if not sometimes malicious
it is insisted that their presence would injure and displace white labor and white laborers
if there ever could be a proper time for mere catch arguments
that time surely is not now
in times like the present men should utter nothing for which they would not willingly be responsible through time and in eternity
is it true
that colored people can displace any more white labor by being free than by remaining slaves
if they stay in their old places
they jostle no white laborers if they leave their old places
they leave them open to white laborers
there is neither more nor less of it
even without deportation
would probably enhance the wages of white labor
and very surely would not reduce them
thus the customary amount of labor would still have to be performed the freed people would surely not do more than their old proportion of it
and very probably for a time would do less
leaving an increased part to white laborers
bringing their labor into greater demand
and consequently enhancing the wages of it
with deportation
even to a limited extent
enhanced wages to white labor is mathematically certain
labor is like any other commodity in the market increase the demand for it and you increase the price of it
reduce the supply of black labor by colonizing the black laborer out of the country
and by precisely so much you increase the demand for and wages of white labor
but it is dreaded that the freed people will swarm forth and cover the whole land
are they not already in the land
will liberation make them any more numerous
equally distributed among the whites of the whole country
and there would be but one colored to seven whites
could the one in any way greatly disturb the seven
there are many communities now having more than one free colored person to seven whites and this without any apparent consciousness of evil from it
the district of columbia and the states of maryland and delaware are all in this condition
the district has more than one free colored to six whites
and yet in its frequent petitions to congress i believe it has never presented the presence of free colored persons as one of its grievances
but why should emancipation south send the free people north
people of any color seldom run unless there be something to run from
heretofore colored people to some extent have fled north from bondage
and now
from both bondage and destitution
but if gradual emancipation and deportation be adopted
they will have neither to flee from
their old masters will give them wages at least until new laborers can be procured
and the freedmen in turn will gladly give their labor for the wages till new homes can be found for them in congenial climes and with people of their own blood and race
this proposition can be trusted on the mutual interests involved
and in any event
can not the north decide for itself whether to receive them
as practice proves more than theory in any case
has there been any irruption of colored people northward because of the abolishment of slavery in this district last spring
what i have said of the proportion of free colored persons to the whites in the district is from the census of 1860
having no reference to persons called contrabands nor to those made free by the act of congress abolishing slavery here
the plan consisting of these articles is recommended
not but that a restoration of the national authority would be accepted without its adoption
nor will the war nor proceedings under the proclamation of september 22
be stayed because of the recommendation of this plan
its timely adoption
i doubt not
would bring restoration
and thereby stay both
and notwithstanding this plan
the recommendation that congress provide by law for compensating any state which may adopt emancipation before this plan shall have been acted upon is hereby earnestly renewed
such would be only an advance part of the plan
and the same arguments apply to both
this plan is recommended as a means
not in exclusion of
but additional to
all others for restoring and preserving the national authority throughout the union
the subject is presented exclusively in its economical aspect
the plan would
i am confident
secure peace more speedily and maintain it more permanently than can be done by force alone
while all it would cost
considering amounts and manner of payment and times of payment
would be easier paid than will be the additional cost of the war if we rely solely upon force
it is much
very much
that it would cost no blood at all
the plan is proposed as permanent constitutional law
it can not become such without the concurrence of
two thirds of congress
and afterwards three fourths of the states
the requisite three fourths of the states will necessarily include seven of the slave states
their concurrence
if obtained
will give assurance of their severally adopting emancipation at no very distant day upon the new constitutional terms
this assurance would end the struggle now and save the union forever
i do not forget the gravity which should characterize a paper addressed to the congress of the nation by the chief magistrate of the nation
nor do i forget that some of you are my seniors
nor that many of you have more experience than i in the conduct of public affairs
yet i trust that in view of the great responsibility resting upon me you will perceive no want of respect to yourselves in any undue earnestness i may seem to display
is it doubted
that the plan i propose
if adopted
would shorten the war
and thus lessen its expenditure of money and of blood
is it doubted that it would restore the national authority and national prosperity and perpetuate both indefinitely
is it doubted that we here congress and executive can secure its adoption
will not the good people respond to a united and earnest appeal from us
can we
can they
by any other means so certainly or so speedily assure these vital objects
we can succeed only by concert
it is not can any of us imagine better
but can we all do better
object whatsoever is possible
still the question recurs
can we do better
the dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate to the stormy present
the occasion is piled high with difficulty
and we must rise with the occasion
as our case is new
so we must think anew and act anew
we must disenthrall ourselves
and then we shall save our country
we can not escape history
we of this congress and this administration will be remembered in spite of ourselves
no personal significance or insignificance can spare one or another of us
the fiery trial through which we pass will light us down in honor or dishonor to the latest generation
we say we are for the union
the world will not forget that we say this
we know how to save the union
the world knows we do know how to save it
even we here
hold the power and bear the responsibility
in giving freedom to the slave we assure freedom to the free honorable alike in what we give and what we preserve
we shall nobly save or meanly lose the last best hope of earth
other means may succeed this could not fail
the way is plain
just a way which if followed the world will forever applaud and god must forever bless
state of the union address abraham lincoln december 8
1863 fellow citizens of the senate and house of representatives
another year of health and of sufficiently abundant harvests has passed
for these
and especially for the improved condition of our national affairs
our renewed and profoundest gratitude to god is due
we remain in peace and friendship with foreign powers
the efforts of disloyal citizens of the united states to involve us in foreign wars to aid an inexcusable insurrection have been unavailing
her britannic majesty's government
as was justly expected
have exercised their authority to prevent the departure of new hostile expeditions from british ports
the emperor of france has by a like proceeding promptly vindicated the neutrality which he proclaimed at the beginning of the contest
questions of great intricacy and importance have arisen out of the blockade and other belligerent operations between the government and several of the maritime powers
but they have been discussed and
as far as was possible
accommodated in a spirit of frankness
and mutual good will
it is especially gratifying that our prize courts
by the impartiality of their adjudications
have commanded the respect and confidence of maritime powers
the supplemental treaty between the united states and great britain for the suppression of the african slave trade
made on the 17th day of february last
has been duly ratified and carried into execution
it is believed that so far as american ports and american citizens are concerned that inhuman and odious traffic has been brought to an end
i shall submit for the consideration of the senate a convention for the adjustment of possessory claims in washington territory arising out of the treaty of the 15th june
between the united states and great britain
and which have been the source of some disquiet among the citizens of that now rapidly improving part of the country
a novel and important question
involving the extent of the maritime jurisdiction of spain in the waters which surround the island of cuba
has been debated without reaching an agreement
and it is proposed in an amicable spirit to refer it to the arbitrament of a friendly power
a convention for that purpose will be submitted to the senate
i have thought it proper
subject to the approval of the senate
to concur with the interested commercial powers in an arrangement for the liquidation of the scheldt dues
upon the principles which have been heretofore adopted in regard to the imposts upon navigation in the waters of denmark
the long pending controversy between this government and that of chile touching the seizure at sitana
in peru
by chilean officers
of a large amount in treasure belonging to citizens of the united states has been brought to a close by the award of his majesty the king of the belgians
to whose arbitration the question was referred by the parties
the subject was thoroughly and patiently examined by that justly respected magistrate
and although the sum awarded to the claimants may not have been as large as they expected there is no reason to distrust the wisdom of his majesty's decision
that decision was promptly complied with by chile when intelligence in regard to it reached that country
the joint commission under the act of the last session for carrying into effect the convention with peru on the subject of claims has been organized at lima
and is engaged in the business intrusted to it
difficulties concerning interoceanic transit through nicaragua are in course of amicable adjustment
in conformity with principles set forth in my last annual message
i have received a representative from the united states of colombia
and have accredited a minister to that republic
incidents occurring in the progress of our civil war have forced upon my attention the uncertain state of international questions touching the rights of foreigners in this country and of united states citizens abroad
in regard to some governments these rights are at least partially
defined by treaties
in no instance
is it expressly stipulated that in the event of civil war a foreigner residing in this country within the lines of the insurgents is to be exempted from the rule which classes him as a belligerent
in whose behalf the government or his country can not expect any privileges or immunities distinct from that character
i regret to say
that such claims have been put forward
and in some instances in behalf of foreigners who have lived in the united states the greater part of their lives
there is reason to believe that many persons born in foreign countries who have declared their intention to become citizens
or who have been fully naturalized
have evaded the military duty required of them by denying the fact and thereby throwing upon the government the burden of proof
it has been found difficult or impracticable to obtain this proof
from the want of guides to the proper sources of information
these might be supplied by requiring clerks of courts where declarations of intention may be made or naturalizations effected to send periodically lists of the names of the persons naturalized or declaring their intention to become citizens to the secretary of the interior
in whose department those names might be arranged and printed for general information
there is also reason to believe that foreigners frequently become citizens of the united states for the sole purpose of evading duties imposed by the laws of their native countries
to which on becoming naturalized here they at once repair
and though never returning to the united states they still claim the interposition of this government as citizens
many altercations and great prejudices have heretofore arisen out of this abuse
it is therefore submitted to your serious consideration
it might be advisable to fix a limit beyond which no citizen of the united states residing abroad may claim the interposition of his government
the right of suffrage has often been assumed and exercised by aliens under pretenses of naturalization
which they have disavowed when drafted into the military service
i submit the expediency of such an amendment of the law as will make the fact of voting an estoppel against any plea of exemption from military service or other civil obligation on the ground of alienage
in common with other western powers
our relations with japan have been brought into serious jeopardy through the perverse opposition of the hereditary aristocracy of the empire to the enlightened and liberal policy of the tycoon
designed to bring the country into the society of nations
it is hoped
although not with entire confidence
that these difficulties may be peacefully overcome
i ask your attention to the claim of the minister residing there for the damages he sustained in the destruction by fire of the residence of the legation at yedo
satisfactory arrangements have been made with the emperor of russia
it is believed
will result in effecting a continuous line of telegraph through that empire from our pacific coast
i recommend to your favorable consideration the subject of an international telegraph across the atlantic ocean
and also of a telegraph between this capital and the national forts along the atlantic seaboard and the gulf of mexico
such communications
established with any reasonable outlay
would be economical as well as effective aids to the diplomatic
and naval service
the consular system of the united states
under the enactments of the last congress
begins to be self sustaining
and there is reason to hope that it may become entirely so with the increase of trade which will ensue whenever peace is restored
our ministers abroad have been faithful in defending american rights
in protecting commercial interests our consuls have necessarily had to encounter increased labors and responsibilities growing out of the war
these they have for the most part met and discharged with zeal and efficiency
this acknowledgment justly includes those consuls who
residing in morocco
and other oriental countries
are charged with complex functions and extraordinary powers
the condition of the several organized territories is generally satisfactory
although indian disturbances in new mexico have not been entirely suppressed
the mineral resources of colorado
new mexico
and arizona are proving far richer than has been heretofore understood
i lay before you a communication on this subject from the governor of new mexico
i again submit to your consideration the expediency of establishing a system for the encouragement of immigration
although this source of national wealth and strength is again flowing with greater freedom than for several years before the insurrection occurred
there is still a great deficiency of laborers in every field of industry
especially in agriculture and in our mines
as well of iron and coal as of the precious metals
while the demand for labor is much increased here
tens of thousands of persons
destitute of remunerative occupation
are thronging our foreign consulates and offering to emigrate to the united states if essential
but very cheap
assistance can be afforded them
it is easy to see that under the sharp discipline of civil war the nation is beginning a new life
this noble effort demands the aid and ought to receive the attention and support of the government
injuries unforeseen by the government and unintended may in some cases have been inflicted on the subjects or citizens of foreign countries
both at sea and on land
by persons in the service of the united states
as this government expects redress from other powers when similar injuries are inflicted by persons in their service upon citizens of the united states
we must be prepared to do justice to foreigners
if the existing judicial tribunals are inadequate to this purpose
a special court may be authorized
with power to hear and decide such claims of the character referred to as may have arisen under treaties and the public law
conventions for adjusting the claims by joint commission have been proposed to some governments
but no definitive answer to the proposition has yet been received from any
in the course of the session i shall probably have occasion to request you to provide indemnification to claimants where decrees of restitution have been rendered and damages awarded by admiralty courts
and in other cases where this government may be acknowledged to be liable in principle and where the amount of that liability has been ascertained by an informal arbitration
the proper officers of the treasury have deemed themselves required by the law of the united states upon the subject to demand a tax upon the incomes of foreign consuls in this country
while such a demand may not in strictness be in derogation of public law
or perhaps of any existing treaty between the united states and a foreign country
the expediency of so far modifying the act as to exempt from tax the income of such consuls as are not citizens of the united states
derived from the emoluments of their office or from property not situated in the united states
is submitted to your serious consideration
i make this suggestion upon the ground that a comity which ought to be reciprocated exempts our consuls in all other countries from taxation to the extent thus indicated
the united states
i think
ought not to be exceptionally illiberal to international trade and commerce
the operations of the treasury during the last year have been successfully conducted
the enactment by congress of a national banking law has proved a valuable support of the public credit and the general legislation in relation to loans has fully answered the expectations of its favorers
some amendments may be required to perfect existing laws
but no change in their principles or general scope is believed to be needed
since these measures have been in operation all demands on the treasury
including the pay of the army and navy
have been promptly met and fully satisfied
no considerable body of troops
it is believed
were ever more amply provided and more liberally and punctually paid
and it may be added that by no people were the burdens incident to a great war ever more cheerfully borne
the receipts during the year from all sources
including loans and balance in the treasury at its commencement
were 901
and the aggregate disbursements 895
leaving a balance on the 1st of july
of 5
of the receipts there were derived from customs 69
from internal revenue 37
from direct tax 1
from lands 167
from miscellaneous sources 3
and from loans 776
making the aggregate 901
of the disbursements there were for the civil service 23
for pensions and indians 4
for interest on public debt 24
for the war department 599
for the navy department 63
for payment of funded and temporary debt 181
making the aggregate 895
65 and leaving the balance of 5
but the payment of funded and temporary debt
having been made from moneys borrowed during the year
must be regarded as merely nominal payments and the moneys borrowed to make them as merely nominal receipts
and their amount
should therefore be deducted both from receipts and disbursements
this being done there remains as actual receipts 720
79 and the actual disbursements 714
leaving the balance as already stated
the actual receipts and disbursements for the first quarter and the estimated receipts and disbursements for the remaining three quarters of the current fiscal year 1864 will be shown in detail by the report of the secretary of the treasury
to which i invite your attention
it is sufficient to say here that it is not believed that actual results will exhibit a state of the finances less favorable to the country than the estimates of that officer heretofore submitted
while it is confidently expected that at the close of the year both disbursements and debt will be found very considerably less than has been anticipated
the report of the secretary of war is a document of great interest
it consists of 1
the military operations of the year
detailed in the report of the general in chief
the organization of colored persons into the war service
the exchange of prisoners
fully set forth in the letter of general hitchcock
the operations under the act for enrolling and calling out the national forces
detailed in the report of the provost marshal general
the organization of the invalid corps
and 6
the operation of the several departments of the quartermaster general
chief of engineers
chief of ordnance
and surgeon general
it has appeared impossible to make a valuable summary of this report
except such as would be too extended for this place
and hence i content myself by asking your careful attention to the report itself
the duties devolving on the naval branch of the service during the year and throughout the whole of this unhappy contest have been discharged with fidelity and eminent success
the extensive blockade has been constantly increasing in efficiency as the navy has expanded
yet on so long a line it has so far been impossible to entirely suppress illicit trade
from returns received at the navy department it appears that more than 1
000 vessels have been captured since the blockade was instituted
and that the value of prizes already sent in for adjudication amounts to over 13
the naval force of the united states consists at this time of 588 vessels completed and in the course of completion
and of these 75 are ironclad or armored steamers
the events of the war give an increased interest and importance to the navy which will probably extend beyond the war itself
the armored vessels in our navy completed and in service
or which are under contract and approaching completion
are believed to exceed in number those of any other power but while these may be relied upon for harbor defense and coast service
others of greater strength and capacity will be necessary for cruising purposes and to maintain our rightful position on the ocean
the change that has taken place in naval vessels and naval warfare since the introduction of steam as a motive power for ships of war demands either a corresponding change in some of our existing navy yards or the establishment of new ones for the construction and necessary repair of modern naval vessels
no inconsiderable embarrassment
and public injury have been experienced from the want of such governmental establishments
the necessity of such a navy yard
so furnished
at some suitable place upon the atlantic seaboard has on repeated occasions been brought to the attention of congress by the navy department
and is again presented in the report of the secretary which accompanies this communication
i think it my duty to invite your special attention to this subject
and also to that of establishing a yard and depot for naval purposes upon one of the western rivers
a naval force has been created on those interior waters
and under many disadvantages
within little more than two years
exceeding in numbers the whole naval force of the country at the commencement of the present administration
satisfactory and important as have been the performances of the heroic men of the navy at this interesting period
they are scarcely more wonderful than the success of our mechanics and artisans in the production of war vessels
which has created a new form of naval power
our country has advantages superior to any other nation in our resources of iron and timber
with inexhaustible quantities of fuel in the immediate vicinity of both
and all available and in close proximity to navigable waters
without the advantage of public works
the resources of the nation have been developed and its power displayed in the construction of a navy of such magnitude
which has at the very period of its creation rendered signal service to the union
the increase of the number of seamen in the public service from 7
500 men in the spring of 1861 to about 34
000 at the present time has been accomplished without special legislation or extraordinary bounties to promote that increase
it has been found
that the operation of the draft
with the high bounties paid for army recruits
is beginning to affect injuriously the naval service
and will
if not corrected
be likely to impair its efficiency by detaching seamen from their proper vocation and inducing them to enter the army
i therefore respectfully suggest that congress might aid both the army and naval services by a definite provision on this subject which would at the same time be equitable to the communities more especially interested
i commend to your consideration the suggestions of the secretary of the navy in regard to the policy of fostering and training seamen and also the education of officers and engineers for the naval service
the naval academy is rendering signal service in preparing midshipmen for the highly responsible duties which in after life they will be required to perform
in order that the country should not be deprived of the proper quota of educated officers
for which legal provision has been made at the naval school
the vacancies caused by the neglect or omission to make nominations from the states in insurrection have been filled by the secretary of the navy
the school is now more full and complete than at any former period
and in every respect entitled to the favorable consideration of congress
during the past fiscal year the financial condition of the post office department has been one of increasing prosperity
and i am gratified in being able to state that the actual postal revenue has nearly equaled the entire expenditures
the latter amounting to 11
84 and the former to 11
leaving a deficiency of but 150
in 1860
the year immediately preceding the rebellion
the deficiency amounted to 5
the postal receipts of that year being 2
19 less than those of 1863
the decrease since 1860 in the annual amount of transportation has been only about 25 per cent
but the annual expenditure on account of the same has been reduced 35 per cent
it is manifest
that the post office department may become self sustaining in a few years
even with the restoration of the whole service
the international conference of postal delegates from the principal countries of europe and america
which was called at the suggestion of the postmaster general
met at paris on the 11th of may last and concluded its deliberations on the 8th of june
the principles established by the conference as best adapted to facilitate postal intercourse between nations and as the basis of future postal conventions inaugurate a general system of uniform international charges at reduced rates of postage
and can not fail to produce beneficial results
i refer you to the report of the secretary of the interior
which is herewith laid before you
for useful and varied information in relation to the public lands
indian affairs
and other matters of public concern pertaining to his department
the quantity of land disposed of during the last and the first quarter of the present fiscal years was 3
549 acres
of which 161
911 acres were sold for cash
514 acres were taken up under the homestead law
and the residue disposed of under laws granting lands for military bounties
for railroad and other purposes
it also appears that the sale of the public lands is largely on the increase
it has long been a cherished opinion of some of our wisest statesmen that the people of the united states had a higher and more enduring interest in the early settlement and substantial cultivation of the public lands than in the amount of direct revenue to be derived from the sale of them
this opinion has had a controlling influence in shaping legislation upon the subject of our national domain
i may cite as evidence of this the liberal measures adopted in reference to actual settlers the grant to the states of the overflowed lands within their limits
in order to their being reclaimed and rendered fit for cultivation the grants to railway companies of alternate sections of land upon the contemplated issues of their roads
which when completed will so largely multiply the facilities for reaching our distant possessions
this policy has received its most signal and beneficent illustration in the recent enactment granting homesteads to actual settlers
since the 1st day of january last the before mentioned quantity of 1
514 acres of land have been taken up under its provisions
this fact and the amount of sales furnish gratifying evidence of increasing settlement upon the public lands
notwithstanding the great struggle in which the energies of the nation have been engaged
and which has required so large a withdrawal of our citizens from their accustomed pursuits
i cordially concur in the recommendation of the secretary of the interior suggesting a modification of the act in favor of those engaged in the military and naval service of the united states
i doubt not that congress will cheerfully adopt such measures as will
without essentially changing the general features of the system
secure to the greatest practicable extent its benefits to those who have left their homes in the defense of the country in this arduous crisis
i invite your attention to the views of the secretary as to the propriety of raising by appropriate legislation a revenue from the mineral lands of the united states
the measures provided at your last session for the removal of certain indian tribes have been carried into effect
sundry treaties have been negotiated
which will in due time be submitted for the constitutional action of the senate
they contain stipulations for extinguishing the possessory rights of the indians to large and valuable tracts of lands
it is hoped that the effect of these treaties will result in the establishment of permanent friendly relations with such of these tribes as have been brought into frequent and bloody collision with our outlying settlements and emigrants
sound policy and our imperative duty to these wards of the government demand our anxious and constant attention to their material well being
to their progress in the arts of civilization
above all
to that moral training which under the blessing of divine providence will confer upon them the elevated and sanctifying influences
the hopes and consolations
of the christian faith
i suggested in my last annual message the propriety of remodeling our indian system
subsequent events have satisfied me of its necessity
the details set forth in the report of the secretary evince the urgent need for immediate legislative action
i commend the benevolent institutions established or patronized by the government in this district to your generous and fostering care
the attention of congress during the last session was engaged to some extent with a proposition for enlarging the water communication between the mississippi river and the northeastern seaboard
which proposition
failed for the time
since then
upon a call of the greatest respectability
a convention has been held at chicago upon the same subject
a summary of whose views is contained in a memorial addressed to the president and congress
and which i now have the honor to lay before you
that this interest is one which ere long will force its own way i do not entertain a doubt
while it is submitted entirely to your wisdom as to what can be done now
augmented interest is given to this subject by the actual commencement of work upon the pacific railroad
under auspices so favorable to rapid progress and completion
the enlarged navigation becomes a palpable need to the great road
i transmit the second annual report of the commissioner of the department of agriculture
asking your attention to the developments in that vital interest of the nation
when congress assembled a year ago
the war had already lasted nearly twenty months
and there had been many conflicts on both land and sea
with varying results the rebellion had been pressed back into reduced limits yet the tone of public feeling and opinion
at home and abroad was not satisfactory
with other signs
the popular elections then just past indicated uneasiness among ourselves
amid much that was cold and menacing
the kindest words coming from europe were uttered in accents of pity that we were too blind to surrender a hopeless cause
our commerce was suffering greatly by a few armed vessels built upon and furnished from foreign shores
and we were threatened with such additions from the same quarter as would sweep our trade from the sea and raise our blockade
we had failed to elicit from european governments anything hopeful upon this subject
the preliminary emancipation proclamation
issued in september
was running its assigned period to the beginning of the new year
a month later the final proclamation came
including the announcement that colored men of suitable condition would be received into the war service
the policy of emancipation and of employing black soldiers gave to the future a new aspect
about which hope and fear and doubt contended in uncertain conflict
according to our political system
as a matter of civil administration
the general government had no lawful power to effect emancipation in any state
and for a long time it had been hoped that the rebellion could be suppressed without resorting to it as a military measure
it was all the while deemed possible that the necessity for it might come
and that if it should the crisis of the contest would then be presented
it came
as was anticipated
it was followed by dark and doubtful days
eleven months having now passed
we are permitted to take another review
the rebel borders are pressed still farther back
and by the complete opening of the mississippi the country dominated by the rebellion is divided into distinct parts
with no practical communication between them
tennessee and arkansas have been substantially cleared of insurgent control
and influential citizens in each
owners of slaves and advocates of slavery at the beginning of the rebellion
now declare openly for emancipation in their respective states
of those states not included in the emancipation proclamation
maryland and missouri
neither of which three years ago would tolerate any restraint upon the extension of slavery into new territories
only dispute now as to the best mode of removing it within their own limits
of those who were slaves at the beginning of the rebellion full 100
000 are now in the united states military service
about one half of which number actually bear arms in the ranks
thus giving the double advantage of taking so much labor from the insurgent cause and supplying the places which otherwise must be filled with so many white men
so far as tested
it is difficult to say they are not as good soldiers as any
no servile insurrection or tendency to violence or cruelty has marked the measures of emancipation and arming the blacks
these measures have been much discussed in foreign countries
contemporary with such discussion
the tone of public sentiment there is much improved
at home the same measures have been fully discussed
and denounced
and the annual elections following are highly encouraging to those whose official duty it is to bear the country through this great trial
thus we have the new reckoning
the crisis which threatened to divide the friends of the union is past
looking now to the present and future
and with reference to a resumption of the national authority within the states wherein that authority has been suspended
i have thought fit to issue a proclamation
a copy of which is herewith transmitted
on examination of this proclamation it will appear
as is believed
that nothing will be attempted beyond what is amply justified by the constitution
the form of an oath is given
but no man is coerced to take it
the man is only promised a pardon in case he voluntarily takes the oath
the constitution authorizes the executive to grant or withhold the pardon at his own absolute discretion
and this includes the power to grant on terms
as is fully established by judicial and other authorities
it is also proffered that if in any of the states named a state government shall be in the mode prescribed set up
such government shall be recognized and guaranteed by the united states
and that under it the state shall
on the constitutional conditions
be protected against invasion and domestic violence
the constitutional obligation of the united states to guarantee to every state in the union a republican form of government and to protect the state in the cases stated is explicit and full
but why tender the benefits of this provision only to a state government set up in this particular way
this section of the constitution contemplates a case wherein the element within a state favorable to republican government in the union may be too feeble for an opposite and hostile element external to or even within the state
and such are precisely the cases with which we are now dealing
an attempt to guarantee and protect a revived state government
constructed in whole or in preponderating part from the very element against whose hostility and violence it is to be protected
is simply absurd
there must be a test by which to separate the opposing elements
so as to build only from the sound and that test is a sufficiently liberal one which accepts as sound whoever will make a sworn recantation of his former unsoundness
but if it be proper to require as a test of admission to the political body an oath of allegiance to the constitution of the united states and to the union under it
why also to the laws and proclamations in regard to slavery
those laws and proclamations were enacted and put forth for the purpose of aiding in the suppression of the rebellion
to give them their fullest effect there had to be a pledge for their maintenance
in my judgment
they have aided and will further aid the cause for which they were intended
to now abandon them would be not only to relinquish a lever of power
but would also be a cruel and an astounding breach of faith
i may add at this point that while i remain in my present position i shall not attempt to retract or modify the emancipation proclamation
nor shall i return to slavery any person who is free by the terms of that proclamation or by any of the acts of congress
for these and other reasons it is thought best that support of these measures shall be included in the oath
and it is believed the executive may lawfully claim it in return for pardon and restoration of forfeited rights
which he has clear constitutional power to withhold altogether or grant upon the terms which he shall deem wisest for the public interest
it should be observed also that this part of the oath is subject to the modifying and abrogating power of legislation and supreme judicial decision
the proposed acquiescence of the national executive in any reasonable temporary state arrangement for the freed people is made with the view of possibly modifying the confusion and destitution which must at best attend all classes by a total revolution of labor throughout whole states
it is hoped that the already deeply afflicted people in those states may be somewhat more ready to give up the cause of their affliction if to this extent this vital matter be left to themselves
while no power of the national executive to prevent an abuse is abridged by the proposition
the suggestion in the proclamation as to maintaining the political framework of the states on what is called reconstruction is made in the hope that it may do good without danger of harm
it will save labor and avoid great confusion
but why any proclamation now upon this subject
this question is beset with the conflicting views that the step might be delayed too long or be taken too soon
in some states the elements for resumption seem ready for action
but remain inactive apparently for want of a rallying point a plan of action
why shall a adopt the plan of b rather than b that of a
and if a and b should agree
how can they know but that the general government here will reject their plan
by the proclamation a plan is presented which may be accepted by them as a rallying point
and which they are assured in advance will not be rejected here
this may bring them to act sooner than they otherwise would
the objections to a premature presentation of a plan by the national executive consist in the danger of committals on points which could be more safely left to further developments
care has been taken to so shape the document as to avoid embarrassments from this source
saying that on certain terms certain classes will be pardoned with rights restored
it is not said that other classes or other terms will never be in included
saying specified way
it is said that reconstruction will be accepted if presented in a not said it will never be accepted in any other way
the movements by state action for emancipation in several of the states not included in the emancipation proclamation are matters of profound gratulation
and while i do not repeat in detail what i have heretofore so earnestly urged upon this subject
my general views and feelings remain unchanged and i trust that congress will omit no fair opportunity of aiding these important steps to a great consummation
in the midst of other cares
however important
we must not lose sight of the fact that the war power is still our main reliance
to that power alone can we look yet for a time to give confidence to the people in the contested regions that the insurgent power will not again overrun them
until that confidence shall be established little can be done anywhere for what is called reconstruction
hence our chiefest care must still be directed to the army and navy
who have thus far borne their harder part so nobly and well and it may be esteemed fortunate that in giving the greatest efficiency to these indispensable arms we do also honorably recognize the gallant men
from commander to sentinel
who compose them
and to whom more than to others the world must stand indebted for the home of freedom disenthralled
and perpetuated
state of the union address abraham lincoln december 6
1864 fellow citizens of the senate and house of representatives
again the blessings of health and abundant harvests claim our profoundest gratitude to almighty god
the condition of our foreign affairs is reasonably satisfactory
mexico continues to be a theater of civil war
while our political relations with that country have undergone no change
we have at the same time strictly maintained neutrality between the belligerents
at the request of the states of costa rica and nicaragua
a competent engineer has been authorized to make a survey of the river san juan and the port of san juan
it is a source of much satisfaction that the difficulties which for a moment excited some political apprehensions and caused a closing of the interoceanic transit route have been amicably adjusted
and that there is a good prospect that the route will soon be reopened with an increase of capacity and adaptation
we could not exaggerate either the commercial or the political importance of that great improvement
it would be doing injustice to an important south american state not to acknowledge the directness
and cordiality with which the united states of colombia have entered into intimate relations with this government
a claims convention has been constituted to complete the unfinished work of the one which closed its session in 1861
the new liberal constitution of venezuela having gone into effect with the universal acquiescence of the people
the government under it has been recognized and diplomatic intercourse with it has opened in a cordial and friendly spirit
the long deferred aves island claim has been satisfactorily paid and discharged
mutual payments have been made of the claims awarded by the late joint commission for the settlement of claims between the united states and peru
an earnest and cordial friendship continues to exist between the two countries
and such efforts as were in my power have been used to remove misunderstanding and avert a threatened war between peru and spain
our relations are of the most friendly nature with chile
the argentine republic
costa rica
san salvador
and hayti
during the past year no differences of any kind have arisen with any of those republics
on the other hand
their sympathies with the united states are constantly expressed with cordiality and earnestness
the claim arising from the seizure of the cargo of the brig macedonian in 1821 has been paid in full by the government of chile
civil war continues in the spanish part of san domingo
apparently without prospect of an early close
official correspondence has been freely opened with liberia
and it gives us a pleasing view of social and political progress in that republic
it may be expected to derive new vigor from american influence
improved by the rapid disappearance of slavery in the united states
i solicit your authority to furnish to the republic a gunboat at moderate cost
to be reimbursed to the united states by installments
such a vessel is needed for the safety of that state against the native african races
and in liberian hands it would be more effective in arresting the african slave trade than a squadron in our own hands
the possession of the least organized naval force would stimulate a generous ambition in the republic
and the confidence which we should manifest by furnishing it would win forbearance and favor toward the colony from all civilized nations
the proposed overland telegraph between america and europe
by the way of behrings straits and asiatic russia
which was sanctioned by congress at the last session
has been undertaken
under very favorable circumstances
by an association of american citizens
with the cordial good will and support as well of this government as of those of great britain and russia
assurances have been received from most of the south american states of their high appreciation of the enterprise and their readiness to cooperate in constructing lines tributary to that world encircling communication
i learn with much satisfaction that the noble design of a telegraphic communication between the eastern coast of america and great britain has been renewed
with full expectation of its early accomplishment
thus it is hoped that with the return of domestic peace the country will be able to resume with energy and advantage its former high career of commerce and civilization
our very popular and estimable representative in egypt died in april last
an unpleasant altercation which arose between the temporary incumbent of the office and the government of the pasha resulted in a suspension of intercourse
the evil was promptly corrected on the arrival of the successor in the consulate
and our relations with egypt
as well as our relations with the barbary powers
are entirely satisfactory
the rebellion which has so long been flagrant in china has at last been suppressed
with the cooperating good offices of this government and of the other western commercial states
the judicial consular establishment there has become very difficult and onerous
and it will need legislative revision to adapt it to the extension of our commerce and to the more intimate intercourse which has been instituted with the government and people of that vast empire
china seems to be accepting with hearty good will the conventional laws which regulate commercial and social intercourse among the western nations
owing to the peculiar situation of japan and the anomalous form of its government
the action of that empire in performing treaty stipulations is inconstant and capricious
good progress has been effected by the western powers
moving with enlightened concert
our own pecuniary claims have been allowed or put in course of settlement
and the inland sea has been reopened to commerce
there is reason also to believe that these proceedings have increased rather than diminished the friendship of japan toward the united states
the ports of norfolk
and pensacola have been opened by proclamation
it is hoped that foreign merchants will now consider whether it is not safer and more profitable to themselves
as well as just to the united states
to resort to these and other open ports than it is to pursue
through many hazards and at vast cost
a contraband trade with other ports which are closed
if not by actual military occupation
at least by a lawful and effective blockade
for myself
i have no doubt of the power and duty of the executive
under the law of nations
to exclude enemies of the human race from an asylum in the united states
if congress should think that proceedings in such cases lack the authority of law
or ought to be further regulated by it
i recommend that provision be made for effectually preventing foreign slave traders from acquiring domicile and facilities for their criminal occupation in our country
it is possible that if it were new and open question the maritime powers
with the lights they now enjoy
would not concede the privileges of a naval belligerent to the insurgents of the united states
as they are
and always have been
equally of ships of war and of ports and harbors
disloyal emissaries have been neither less assiduous nor more successful during the last year than they were before that time in their efforts under favor of that privilege
to embroil our country in foreign wars
the desire and determination of the governments of the maritime states to defeat that design are believed to be as sincere as and can not be more earnest than our own
unforeseen political difficulties have arisen
especially in brazilian and british ports and on the northern boundary of the united states
which have required
and are likely to continue to require
the practice of constant vigilance and a just and conciliatory spirit on the part of the united states
as well as of the nations concerned and their governments
commissioners have been appointed under the treaty with great britain on the adjustment of the claims of the hudsons bay and pugets sound agricultural companies
in oregon
and are now proceeding to the execution of the trust assigned to them
in view of the insecurity of life and property in the region adjacent to the canadian border
by reason of recent assaults and depredations committed by inimical and desperate persons who are harbored there
it has been thought proper to give notice that after the expiration of six months
the period conditionally stipulated in the existing arrangement with great britain
the united states must hold themselves at liberty to increase their naval armament upon the lakes if they shall find that proceeding necessary
the condition of the border will necessarily come into consideration in connection with the question of continuing or modifying the rights of transit from canada through the united states
as well as the regulation of imposts
which were temporarily established by the reciprocity treaty of the 5th june
i desire
to be understood while making this statement that the colonial authorities of canada are not deemed to be intentionally unjust or unfriendly toward the united states
on the contrary
there is every reason to expect that
with the approval of the imperial government
they will take the necessary measures to prevent new incursions across the border
the act passed at the last session for the encouragement of immigration has so far as was possible been put into operation
it seems to need amendment which will enable the officers of the government to prevent the practice of frauds against the immigrants while on their way and on their arrival in the ports
so as to secure them here a free choice of avocations and places of settlement
a liberal disposition toward this great national policy is manifested by most of the european states
and ought to be reciprocated on our part by giving the immigrants effective national protection
i regard our immigrants as one of the principal replenishing streams which are appointed by providence to repair the ravages of internal war and its wastes of national strength and health
all that is necessary is to secure the flow of that stream in its present fullness
and to that end the government must in every way make it manifest that it neither needs nor designs to impose involuntary military service upon those who come from other lands to cast their lot in our country
the financial affairs of the government have been successfully administered during the last year
the legislation of the last session of congress has beneficially affected the revenues
although sufficient time has not yet elapsed to experience the full effect of several of the provisions of the acts of congress imposing increased taxation
the receipts during the year from all sources
upon the basis of warrants signed by the secretary of the treasury
including loans and the balance in the treasury on the 1st day of july
were 1
and the aggregate disbursements
upon the same basis
were 1
leaving a balance in the treasury
as shown by warrants
of 96
deduct from these amounts the amount of the principal of the public debt redeemed and the amount of issues in substitution therefor
and the actual cash operations of the treasury were
57 disbursements
86 which leaves a cash balance in the treasury of 18
of the receipts there were derived from customs 102
from lands 588
from direct taxes 475
from internal revenue 109
from miscellaneous sources 47
and from loans applied to actual expenditures
including former balance
there were disbursed for the civil service 27
for pensions and indians 7
for the war department 690
for the navy department 85
for interest on the public debt 53
making an aggregate of 865
86 and leaving a balance in the treasury of 18
as before stated
for the actual receipts and disbursements for the first quarter and the estimated receipts and disbursements for the three remaining quarters of the current fiscal year
and the general operations of the treasury in detail
i refer you to the report of the secretary of the treasury
i concur with him in the opinion that the proportion of moneys required to meet the expenses consequent upon the war derived from taxation should be still further increased and i earnestly invite your attention to this subject
to the end that there may be such additional legislation as shall be required to meet the just expectations of the secretary
the public debt on the 1st day of july last
as appears by the books of the treasury
amounted to 1
should the war continue for another year
that amount may be increased by not far from five hundred millions
as it is
for the most part by our own people
it has become a substantial branch of national
though private
for obvious reasons the more nearly this property can be distributed among all the people the better
to favor such general distribution
greater inducements to become owners might
with good effect and without injury be presented to persons of limited means
with this view i suggest whether it might not be both competent and expedient for congress to provide that a limited amount of some future issue of public securities might be held by any bona fide purchaser exempt from taxation and from seizure for debt
under such restrictions and limitations as might be necessary to guard against abuse of so important a privilege
this would enable every prudent person to set aside a small annuity against a possible day of want
privileges like these would render the possession of such securities to the amount limited most desirable to every person of small means who might be able to save enough for the purpose
the great advantage of citizens being creditors as well as debtors with relation to the public debt is obvious
men readily perceive that they can not be much oppressed by a debt which they owe to themselves
the public debt on the 1st day of july last
although somewhat exceeding the estimate of the secretary of the treasury made to congress at the commencement of the last session
falls short of the estimate of that officer made in the preceding december as to its probable amount at the beginning of this year by the sum of 3
this fact exhibits a satisfactory condition and conduct of the operations of the treasury
the national banking system is proving to be acceptable to capitalists and to the people
on the 25th day of november 584 national banks had been organized
a considerable number of which were conversions from state banks
changes from state systems to the national system are rapidly taking place
and it is hoped that very soon there will be in the united states no banks of issue not authorized by congress and no bank note circulation not secured by the government
that the government and the people will derive great benefit from this change in the banking systems of the country can hardly be questioned
the national system will create a reliable and permanent influence in support of the national credit and protect the people against losses in the use of paper money
whether or not any further legislation is advisable for the suppression of state bank issues it will be for congress to determine
it seems quite clear that the treasury can not be satisfactorily conducted unless the government can exercise a restraining power over the bank note circulation of the country
the report of the secretary of war and the accompanying documents will detail the campaigns of the armies in the field since the date of the last annual message
and also the operations of the several administrative bureaus of the war department during the last year
it will also specify the measures deemed essential for the national defense and to keep up and supply the requisite military force
the report of the secretary of the navy presents a comprehensive and satisfactory exhibit of the affairs of that department and of the naval service
it is a subject of congratulation and laudable pride to our countrymen that a navy of such vast proportions has been organized in so brief a period and conducted with so much efficiency and success
the general exhibit of the navy
including vessels under construction on the 1st of december
shows a total of 671 vessels
carrying 4
610 guns
and of 510
396 tons
being an actual increase during the year
over and above all losses by shipwreck or in battle
of 83 vessels
167 guns
and 42
427 tons
the total number of men at this time in the naval service
including officers
is about 51
there have been captured by the navy during the year 324 vessels
and the whole number of naval captures since hostilities commenced is 1
of which 267 are steamers
the gross proceeds arising from the sale of condemned prize property thus far reported amount to 14
a large amount of such proceeds is still under adjudication and yet to be reported
the total expenditure of the navy department of every description
including the cost of the immense squadrons that have been called into existence from the 4th of march
to the 1st of november
is 238
your favorable consideration is invited to the various recommendations of the secretary of the navy
especially in regard to a navy yard and suitable establishment for the construction and repair of iron vessels and the machinery and armature for our ships
to which reference was made in my last annual message
your attention is also invited to the views expressed in the report in relation to the legislation of congress at its last session in respect to prize on our inland waters
i cordially concur in the recommendation of the secretary as to the propriety of creating the new rank of vice admiral in our naval service
your attention is invited to the report of the postmaster general for a detailed account of the operations and financial condition of the post office department
the postal revenues for the year ending june 30
amounted to 12
78 and the expenditures to 12
the excess of expenditures over receipts being 206
the views presented by the postmaster general on the subject of special grants by the government in aid of the establishment of new lines of ocean mail steamships and the policy he recommends for the development of increased commercial intercourse with adjacent and neighboring countries should receive the careful consideration of congress
it is of noteworthy interest that the steady expansion of population
and governmental institutions over the new and unoccupied portions of our country have scarcely been checked
much less impeded or destroyed
by our great civil war
which at first glance would seem to have absorbed almost the entire energies of the nation
the organization and admission of the state of nevada has been completed in conformity with law
and thus our excellent system is firmly established in the mountains
which once seemed a barren and uninhabitable waste between the atlantic states and those which have grown up on the coast of the pacific ocean
the territories of the union are generally in a condition of prosperity and rapid growth
idaho and montana
by reason of their great distance and the interruption of communication with them by indian hostilities
have been only partially organized but it is understood that these difficulties are about to disappear
which will permit their governments
like those of the others
to go into speedy and full operation
as intimately connected with and promotive of this material growth of the nation
i ask the attention of congress to the valuable information and important recommendations relating to the public lands
indian affairs
the pacific railroad
and mineral discoveries contained in the report of the secretary of the interior which is herewith transmitted
and which report also embraces the subjects of patents
and other topics of public interest pertaining to his department
the quantity of public land disposed of during the five quarters ending on the 30th of september last was 4
342 acres
of which 1
614 acres were entered under the homestead law
the remainder was located with military land warrants
agricultural scrip certified to states for railroads
and sold for cash
the cash received from sales and location fees was 1
the income from sales during the fiscal year ending june 30
was 678
against 136
95 received during the preceding year
the aggregate number of acres surveyed during the year has been equal to the quantity disposed of
and there is open to settlement about 133
000 acres of surveyed land
the great enterprise of connecting the atlantic with the pacific states by railways and telegraph lines has been entered upon with a vigor that gives assurance of success
notwithstanding the embarrassments arising from the prevailing high prices of materials and labor
the route of the main line of the road has been definitely located for 100 miles westward from the initial point at omaha city
and a preliminary location of the pacific railroad of california has been made from sacramento eastward to the great bend of the truckee river in nevada
numerous discoveries of gold
and cinnabar mines have been added to the many heretofore known
and the country occupied by the sierra nevada and rocky mountains and the subordinate ranges now teems with enterprising labor
which is richly remunerative
it is believed that the product of the mines of precious metals in that region has during the year reached
if not exceeded
one hundred millions in value
it was recommended in my last annual message that our indian system be remodeled
congress at its last session
acting upon the recommendation
did provide for reorganizing the system in california
and it is believed that under the present organization the management of the indians there will be attended with reasonable success
much yet remains to be done to provide for the proper government of the indians in other parts of the country
to render it secure for the advancing set tier
and to provide for the welfare of the indian
the secretary reiterates his recommendations
and to them the attention of congress is invited
the liberal provisions made by congress for paying pensions to invalid soldiers and sailors of the republic and to the widows
and dependent mothers of those who have fallen in battle or died of disease contracted or of wounds received in the service of their country have been diligently administered
there have been added to the pension rolls during the year ending the 30th day of june last the names of 16
770 invalid soldiers and of 271 disabled seamen
making the present number of army invalid pensioners 22
767 and of navy invalid pensioners 712
of widows
and mothers 22
198 have been placed on the army pension rolls and 248 on the navy rolls
the present number of army pensioners of this class is 25
433 and of navy pensioners 793
at the beginning of the year the number of revolutionary pensioners was 1
only 12 of them were soldiers
of whom 7 have since died
the remainder are those who under the law receive pensions because of relationship to revolutionary soldiers
during the year ending the 30th of june
92 have been paid to pensioners of all classes
i cheerfully commend to your continued patronage the benevolent institutions of the district of columbia which have hitherto been established or fostered by congress
and respectfully refer for information concerning them and in relation to the washington aqueduct
the capitol
and other matters of local interest to the report of the secretary
the agricultural department
under the supervision of its present energetic and faithful head
is rapidly commending itself to the great and vital interest it was created to advance it is peculiarly the people's department
in which they feel more directly concerned than in any other
i commend it to the continued attention and fostering care of congress
the war continues
since the last annual message all the important lines and positions then occupied by our forces have been maintained and our arms have steadily advanced
thus liberating the regions left in rear
so that missouri
and parts of other states have again produced reasonably fair crops
the most remarkable feature in the military operations of the year is general sherman's attempted march of 300 miles directly through the insurgent region
it tends to show a great increase of our relative strength that our general in chief should feel able to confront and hold in check every active force of the enemy
and yet to detach a well appointed large army to move on such an expedition
the result not yet being known
conjecture in regard to it is not here indulged
important movements have also occurred during the year to the effect of molding society for durability in the union
although short of complete success
it is much in the fight direction that 12
000 citizens in each of the states of arkansas and louisiana have organized loyal state governments
with free constitutions
and are earnestly struggling to maintain and administer them
the movements in the same direction
more extensive though less definite
in missouri
and tennessee should not be overlooked
but maryland presents the example of complete success
maryland is secure to liberty and union for all the future
the genius of rebellion will no more claim maryland
like another foul spirit being driven out
it may seek to tear her
but it will woo her no more
at the last session of congress a proposed amendment of the constitution abolishing slavery throughout the united states passed the senate
but failed for lack of the requisite two thirds vote in the house of representatives
although the present is the same congress and nearly the same members
and without questioning the wisdom or patriotism of those who stood in opposition
i venture to recommend the reconsideration and passage of the measure at the present session
of course the abstract question is not changed but in intervening election shows almost certainly that the next congress will pass the measure if this does not
hence there is only a question of time as to when the proposed amendment will go to the states for their action
and as it is to so go at all events
may we not agree that the sooner the better
it is not claimed that the election has imposed a duty on members to change their views or their votes any further than
as an additional element to be considered
their judgment may be affected by it
it is the voice of the people now for the first time heard upon the question
in a great national crisis like ours unanimity of action among those seeking a common end is very desirable almost indispensable
and yet no approach to such unanimity is attainable unless some deference shall be paid to the will of the majority simply because it is the will of the majority
in this case the common end is the maintenance of the union
and among the means to secure that end such will
through the election
is most dearly declared in favor of such constitutional amendment
the most reliable indication of public purpose in this country is derived through our popular elections
judging by the recent canvass and its result
the purpose of the people within the loyal states to maintain the integrity of the union was never more firm nor more nearly unanimous than now
the extraordinary calmness and good order with which the millions of voters met and mingled at the polls give strong assurance of this
not only all those who supported the union ticket
so called
but a great majority of the opposing party also may be fairly claimed to entertain and to be actuated by the same purpose
it is an unanswerable argument to this effect that no candidate for any office whatever
high or low
has ventured to seek votes on the avowal that he was for giving up the union
there have been much impugning of motives and much heated controversy as to the proper means and best mode of advancing the union cause
but on the distinct issue of union or no union the politicians have shown their instinctive knowledge that there is no diversity among the people
in affording the people the fair opportunity of showing one to another and to the world this firmness and unanimity of purpose
the election has been of vast value to the national cause
the election has exhibited another tact not less valuable to be known the fact that we do not approach exhaustion in the most important branch of national resources
that of living men
while it is melancholy to reflect that the war has filled so many graves and carried mourning to so many hearts
it is some relief to know that
compared with the surviving
the fallen have been so few
while corps and divisions and brigades and regiments have formed and fought and dwindled and gone out of existence
a great majority of the men who composed them are still living
the same is true of the naval service
the election returns prove this
so many voters could not else be found
the states regularly holding elections
both now and four years ago
to wit
new hampshire
new jersey
new york
rhode island
west virginia
and wisconsin
east 3
011 votes now
against 3
222 cast then
showing an aggregate now of 3
to this is to be added 33
762 cast now in the new states of kansas and nevada
which states did not vote in 1860
thus swelling the aggregate to 4
773 and the net increase during the three years and a half of war to 145
a table is appended showing particulars
to this again should be added the number of all soldiers in the field from massachusetts
rhode island
new jersey
and california
who by the laws of those states could not vote away from their homes
and which number can not be less than 90
nor yet is this all
the number in organized territories is triple now what it was four years ago
while thousands
white and black
join us as the national arms press back the insurgent lines
so much is shown
affirmatively and negatively
by the election
it is not material to inquire how the increase has been produced or to show that it would have been greater but for the war
which is probably true
the important fact remains demonstrated that we have more men now than we had when the war began that we are not exhausted nor in process of exhaustion that we are gaining strength and may if need be maintain the contest indefinitely
this as to men
material resources are now more complete and abundant than ever
the national resources
are unexhausted
as we believe
the public purpose to reestablish and maintain the national authority is unchanged
as we believe
the manner of continuing the effort remains to choose
on careful consideration of all the evidence accessible it seems to me that no attempt at negotiation with the insurgent leader could result in any good
he would accept nothing short of severance of the union
precisely what we will not and can not give
his declarations to this effect are explicit and oft repeated
he does not attempt to deceive us
he affords us no excuse to deceive ourselves
he can not voluntarily reaccept the union we can not voluntarily yield it
between him and us the issue is distinct
and inflexible
it is an issue which can only be tried by war and decided by victory
if we yield
we are beaten if the southern people fail him
he is beaten
either way it would be the victory and defeat following war
what is true
of him who heads the insurgent cause is not necessarily true of those who follow
although he can not reaccept the union
they can
some of them
we know
already desire peace and reunion
the number of such may increase
they can at any moment have peace simply by laying down their arms and submitting to the national authority under the constitution
alter so much the government could not
if it would
maintain war against them
the loyal people would not sustain or allow it
if questions should remain
we would adjust them by the peaceful means of legislation
and votes
operating only in constitutional and lawful channels
some certain
and other possible
questions are and would be beyond the executive power to adjust as
for instance
the admission of members into congress and whatever might require the appropriation of money
the executive power itself would be greatly diminished by the cessation of actual war
pardons and remissions of forfeitures
would still be within executive control
in what spirit and temper this control would be exercised can be fairly judged of by the past
a year ago general pardon and amnesty
upon specified terms
were offered to all except certain designated classes
and it was at the same time made known that the excepted classes were still within contemplation of special clemency
during the year many availed themselves of the general provision
and many more would
only that the signs of bad faith in some led to such precautionary measures as rendered the practical process less easy and certain
during the same time also special pardons have been granted to individuals of the excepted classes
and no voluntary application has been denied
thus practically the door has been for a full year open to all except such as were not in condition to make free choice that is
such as were in custody or under constraint
it is still so open to all
but the time may come
probably will come
when public duty shall demand that it be closed and that in lieu more rigorous measures than heretofore shall be adopted
in presenting the abandonment of armed resistance to the national authority on the part of the insurgents as the only indispensable condition to ending the war on the part of the government
i retract nothing heretofore said as to slavery
i repeat the declaration made a year a ago
that while i remain in my present position i shall not attempt to retract or modify the emancipation proclamation
nor shall i return to slavery any person who is free by the terms of that proclamation or by any of the acts of congress
if the people should
by whatever mode or means
make it an executive duty to re enslave such persons
and not i
must be their instrument to perform it
in stating a single condition of peace i mean simply to say that the war will cease on the part of the government whenever it shall have ceased on the part of those who began it

abraham lincoln by james russell lowell there have been many painful crises since the impatient vanity of south carolina hurried ten prosperous commonwealths into a crime whose assured retribution was to leave them either at the mercy of the nation they had wronged
or of the anarchy they had summoned but could not control
when no thoughtful american opened his morning paper without dreading to find that he had no longer a country to love and honor
whatever the result of the convulsion whose first shocks were beginning to be felt
there would still be enough square miles of earth for elbow room but that ineffable sentiment made up of memory and hope
of instinct and tradition
which swells every man's heart and shapes his thought
though perhaps never present to his consciousness
would be gone from it
leaving it common earth and nothing more
men might gather rich crops from it
but that ideal harvest of priceless associations would be reaped no longer that fine virtue which sent up messages of courage and security from every sod of it would have evaporated beyond recall
we should be irrevocably cut off from our past
and be forced to splice the ragged ends of our lives upon whatever new conditions chance might leave dangling for us
we confess that we had our doubts at first whether the patriotism of our people were not too narrowly provincial to embrace the proportions of national peril
we felt an only too natural distrust of immense public meetings and enthusiastic cheers
that a reaction should follow the holiday enthusiasm with which the war was entered on
that it should follow soon
and that the slackening of public spirit should be proportionate to the previous over tension
might well be foreseen by all who had studied human nature or history
men acting gregariously are always in extremes as they are one moment capable of higher courage
so they are liable
the next
to baser depression
and it is often a matter of chance whether numbers shall multiply confidence or discouragement
nor does deception lead more surely to distrust of men
than self deception to suspicion of principles
the only faith that wears well and holds its color in all weathers is that which is woven of conviction and set with the sharp mordant of experience
enthusiasm is good material for the orator
but the statesman needs something more durable to work in
must be able to rely on the deliberate reason and consequent firmness of the people
without which that presence of mind
no less essential in times of moral than of material peril
will be wanting at the critical moment
would this fervor of the free states hold out
was it kindled by a just feeling of the value of constitutional liberty
had it body enough to withstand the inevitable dampening of checks
had our population intelligence enough to comprehend that the choice was between order and anarchy
between the equilibrium of a government by law and the tussle of misrule by pronunciamiento
could a war be maintained without the ordinary stimulus of hatred and plunder
and with the impersonal loyalty of principle
these were serious questions
and with no precedent to aid in answering them
at the beginning of the war there was
occasion for the most anxious apprehension
a president known to be infected with the political heresies
and suspected of sympathy with the treason
of the southern conspirators
had just surrendered the reins
we will not say of power
but of chaos
to a successor known only as the representative of a party whose leaders
with long training in opposition
had none in the conduct of affairs an empty treasury was called on to supply resources beyond precedent in the history of finance the trees were yet growing and the iron unmined with which a navy was to be built and armored officers without discipline were to make a mob into an army and
above all
the public opinion of europe
echoed and reinforced with every vague hint and every specious argument of despondency by a powerful faction at home
was either contemptuously sceptical or actively hostile
it would be hard to over estimate the force of this latter element of disintegration and discouragement among a people where every citizen at home
and every soldier in the field
is a reader of newspapers
the peddlers of rumor in the north were the most effective allies of the rebellion
a nation can be liable to no more insidious treachery than that of the telegraph
sending hourly its electric thrill of panic along the remotest nerves of the community
till the excited imagination makes every real danger loom heightened with its unreal double
and even if we look only at more palpable difficulties
the problem to be solved by our civil war was so vast
both in its immediate relations and its future consequences the conditions of its solution were so intricate and so greatly dependent on incalculable and uncontrollable contingencies so many of the data
whether for hope or fear
from their novelty
incapable of arrangement under any of the categories of historical precedent
that there were moments of crisis when the firmest believer in the strength and sufficiency of the democratic theory of government might well hold his breath in vague apprehension of disaster
our teachers of political philosophy
solemnly arguing from the precedent of some petty grecian
or flemish city
whose long periods of aristocracy were broken now and then by awkward parentheses of mob
had always taught us that democracies were incapable of the sentiment of loyalty
of concentrated and prolonged effort
of far reaching conceptions were absorbed in material interests impatient of regular
and much more of exceptional restraint had no natural nucleus of gravitation
nor any forces but centrifugal were always on the verge of civil war
and slunk at last into the natural almshouse of bankrupt popular government
a military despotism
here was indeed a dreary outlook for persons who knew democracy
not by rubbing shoulders with it lifelong
but merely from books
and america only by the report of some fellow briton
having eaten a bad dinner or lost a carpet bag here
had written to the times demanding redress
and drawing a mournful inference of democratic instability
nor were men wanting among ourselves who had so steeped their brains in london literature as to mistake cockneyism for european culture
and contempt of their country for cosmopolitan breadth of view
and who
owing all they had an all they were to democracy
thought it had an air of high breeding to join in the shallow epicedium that our bubble had burst
but beside any disheartening influences which might affect the timid or the despondent
there were reasons enough of settled gravity against any over confidence of hope
a war which
whether we consider the expanse of the territory at stake
the hosts brought into the field
or the reach of the principles involved
may fairly be reckoned the most momentous of modern times was to be waged by a people divided at home
unnerved by fifty years of peace
under a chief magistrate without experience and without reputation
whose every measure was sure to be cunningly hampered by a jealous and unscrupulous minority
and who
while dealing with unheard of complications at home
must soothe a hostile neutrality abroad
waiting only a pretext to become war
all this was to be done without warning and without preparation
while at the same time a social revolution was to be accomplished in the political condition of four millions of people
by softening the prejudices
allaying the fears
and gradually obtaining the cooperation
of their unwilling liberators
if ever there were an occasion when the heightened imagination of the historian might see destiny visibly intervening in human affairs
here was a knot worthy of her shears
was any system of government tried by so continuous and searching a strain as ours during the last three years never has any shown itself stronger and never could that strength be so directly traced to the virtue and intelligence of the people
to that general enlightenment and prompt efficiency of public opinion possible only under the influence of a political framework like our own
we find it hard to understand how even a foreigner should be blind to the grandeur of the combat of ideas that has been going on here
to the heroic energy
and self reliance of a nation proving that it knows how much dearer greatness is than mere power and we own that it is impossible for us to conceive the mental and moral condition of the american who does not feel his spirit braced and heightened by being even a spectator of such qualities and achievements
that a steady purpose and a definite aim have been given to the jarring forces which
at the beginning of the war
spent themselves in the discussion of schemes which could only become operative
if at all
after the war was over that a popular excitement has been slowly intensified into an earnest national will that a somewhat impracticable moral sentiment has been made the unconscious instrument of a practical moral end that the treason of covert enemies
the jealousy of rivals
the unwise zeal of friends
have been made not only useless for mischief
but even useful for good that the conscientious sensitiveness of england to the horrors of civil conflict has been prevented from complicating a domestic with a foreign war all these results
any one of which might suffice to prove greatness in a ruler
have been mainly due to the good sense
the good humor
the sagacity
the large mindedness
and the unselfish honesty of the unknown man whom a blind fortune
as it seemed
had lifted from the crowd to the most dangerous and difficult eminence of modern times
it is by presence of mind in untried emergencies that the native metal of a man is tested it is by the sagacity to see
and the fearless honesty to admit
whatever of truth there may be in an adverse opinion
in order more convincingly to expose the fallacy that lurks behind it
that a reasoner at length gains for his mere statement of a fact the force of argument it is by a wise forecast which allows hostile combinations to go so far as by the inevitable reaction to become elements of his own power
that a politician proves his genius for state craft and especially it is by so gently guiding public sentiment that he seems to follow it
by so yielding doubtful points that he can be firm without seeming obstinate in essential ones
and thus gain the advantages of compromise without the weakness of concession by so instinctively comprehending the temper and prejudices of a people as to make them gradually conscious of the superior wisdom of his freedom from temper and prejudice
it is by qualities such as these that a magistrate shows himself worthy to be chief in a commonwealth of freemen
and it is for qualities such as these that we firmly believe history will rank mr
lincoln among the most prudent of statesmen and the most successful of rulers
if we wish to appreciate him
we have only to conceive the inevitable chaos in which we should now be weltering
had a weak man or an unwise one been chosen in his stead
bare is back
says the norse proverb
without brother behind it and this is
by analogy
true of an elective magistracy
the hereditary ruler in any critical emergency may reckon on the inexhaustible resources of prestige
of sentiment
of superstition
of dependent interest
while the new man must slowly and painfully create all these out of the unwilling material around him
by superiority of character
by patient singleness of purpose
by sagacious presentiment of popular tendencies and instinctive sympathy with the national character
lincoln's task was one of peculiar and exceptional difficulty
long habit had accustomed the american people to the notion of a party in power
and of a president as its creature and organ
while the more vital fact
that the executive for the time being represents the abstract idea of government as a permanent principle superior to all party and all private interest
had gradually become unfamiliar
they had so long seen the public policy more or less directed by views of party
and often even of personal advantage
as to be ready to suspect the motives of a chief magistrate compelled
for the first time in our history
to feel himself the head and hand of a great nation
and to act upon the fundamental maxim
laid down by all publicists
that the first duty of a government is to depend and maintain its own existence
a powerful weapon seemed to be put into the hands of the opposition by the necessity under which the administration found itself of applying this old truth to new relations
nor were the opposition his only nor his most dangerous opponents
the republicans had carried the country upon an issue in which ethics were more directly and visibly mingled with politics than usual
their leaders were trained to a method of oratory which relied for its effect rather on the moral sense than the understanding
their arguments were drawn
not so much from experience as from general principles of right and wrong
when the war came
their system continued to be applicable and effective
for here again the reason of the people was to be reached and kindled through their sentiments
it was one of those periods of excitement
while they last
exalt and clarify the minds of men
giving to the mere words country
human rights
a meaning and a force beyond that of sober and logical argument
they were convictions
maintained and defended by the supreme logic of passion
that penetrating fire ran in and roused those primary instincts that make their lair in the dens and caverns of the mind
what is called the great popular heart was awakened
that indefinable something which may be
according to circumstances
the highest reason or the most brutish unreason
but enthusiasm
once cold
can never be warmed over into anything better than cant
and phrases
when once the inspiration that filled them with beneficent power has ebbed away
retain only that semblance of meaning which enables them to supplant reason in hasty minds
among the lessons taught by the french revolution there is none sadder or more striking than this
that you may make everything else out of the passions of men except a political system that will work
and that there is nothing so pitilessly and unconsciously cruel as sincerity formulated into dogma
it is always demoralizing to extend the domain of sentiment over questions where it has no legitimate jurisdiction and perhaps the severest strain upon mr
lincoln was in resisting a tendency of his own supporters which chimed with his own private desires
while wholly opposed to his convictions of what would be wise policy
the change which three years have brought about is too remarkable to be passed over without comment
too weighty in its lesson not to be laid to heart
never did a president enter upon office with less means at his command
outside his own strength of heart and steadiness of understanding
for inspiring confidence in the people
and so winning it for himself
than mr
all that was known of him was that he was a good stump speaker
nominated for his availability
that is
because he had no history
and chosen by a party with whose more extreme opinions he was not in sympathy
it might well be feared that a man past fifty
against whom the ingenuity of hostile partisans could rake up no accusation
must be lacking in manliness of character
in decision of principle
in strength of will that a man who was at best only the representative of a party
and who yet did not fairly represent even that
would fail of political
much more of popular
and certainly no one ever entered upon office with so few resources of power in the past
and so many materials of weakness in the present
as mr
even in that half of the union which acknowledged him as president
there was a large
and at that time dangerous
that hardly admitted his claim to the office
and even in the party that elected him there was also a large minority that suspected him of being secretly a communicant with the church of laodicea
1 all he did was sure to be virulently attacked as ultra by one side all that he left undone
to be stigmatized as proof of lukewarmness and backsliding by the other
meanwhile he was to carry on a truly colossal war by means of both he was to disengage the country from diplomatic entanglements of unprecedented peril undisturbed by the help or the hindrance of either
and to win from the crowning dangers of his administration
in the confidence of the people
the means of his safety and their own
he has contrived to do it
and perhaps none of our presidents since washington has stood so firm in the confidence of the people as he does after three years of stormy administration
1 see revelation
chapter 3
verse 15
lincoln's policy was a tentative one
and rightly so
he laid down no programme which must compel him to be either inconsistent or unwise
no cast iron theorem to which circumstances must be fitted as they rose
or else be useless to his ends
he seemed to have chosen mazarin's motto
le temps et moi
1 the moi
to be sure
was not very prominent at first but it has grown more and more so
till the world is beginning to be persuaded that it stands for a character of marked individuality and capacity for affairs
time was his prime minister
we began to think
at one period
his general in chief also
at first he was so slow that he tired out all those who see no evidence of progress but in blowing up the engine then he was so fast
that he took the breath away from those who think there is no getting on safety while there is a spark of fire under the boilers
god is the only being who has time enough but a prudent man
who knows how to seize occasion
can commonly make a shift to find as much as he needs
as it seems to us in reviewing his career
though we have sometimes in our impatience thought otherwise
has always waited
as a wise man should
till the right moment brought up all his reserves
semper nocuit differre paratis
2 is a sound axiom
but the really efficacious man will also be sure to know when he is not ready
and be firm against all persuasion and reproach till he is
1 time and i
cardinal mazarin was prime minister of louis xiv
of france
mazarin said
was his prime minister
2 it is always bad for those who are ready to put off action
one would be apt to think
from some of the criticisms made on mr
lincoln's course by those who mainly agree with him in principle
that the chief object of a statesman should be rather to proclaim his adhesion to certain doctrines
than to achieve their triumph by quietly accomplishing his ends
in our opinion
there is no more unsafe politician than a conscientiously rigid doctrinaire
nothing more sure to end in disaster than a theoretic scheme of policy that admits of no pliability for contingencies
there is a popular image of an impossible he
in whose plastic hands the submissive destinies of mankind become as wax
and to whose commanding necessity the toughest facts yield with the graceful pliancy of fiction but in real life we commonly find that the men who control circumstances
as it is called
are those who have learned to allow for the influence of their eddies
and have the nerve to turn them to account at the happy instant
lincoln's perilous task has been to carry a rather shaky raft through the rapids
making fast the unrulier logs as he could snatch opportunity
and the country is to be congratulated that he did not think it his duty to run straight at all hazards
but cautiously to assure himself with his setting pole where the main current was
and keep steadily to that
he is still in wild water
but we have faith that his skill and sureness of eye will bring him out right at last
a curious
as we think
not inapt parallel
might be drawn between mr
lincoln and one of the most striking figures in modern history
henry iv
of france
the career of the latter may be more picturesque
as that of a daring captain always is but in all its vicissitudes there is nothing more romantic than that sudden change
as by a rub of aladdin's lamp
from the attorney's office in a country town of illinois to the helm of a great nation in times like these
the analogy between the characters and circumstances of the two men is in many respects singularly close
succeeding to a rebellion rather than a crown
henry's chief material dependence was the huguenot party
whose doctrines sat upon him with a looseness distasteful certainly
if not suspicious
to the more fanatical among them
king only in name over the greater part of france
and with his capital barred against him
it yet gradually became clear to the more far seeing even of the catholic party that he was the only centre of order and legitimate authority round which france could reorganize itself
while preachers who held the divine right of kings made the churches of paris ring with declamations in favor of democracy rather than submit to the heretic dog of bearnois
1 much as our soi disant democrats have lately been preaching the divine right of slavery
and denouncing the heresies of the declaration of independence
henry bore both parties in hand till he was convinced that only one course of action could possibly combine his own interests and those of france
meanwhile the protestants believed somewhat doubtfully that he was theirs
the catholics hoped somewhat doubtfully that he would be theirs
and henry himself turned aside remonstrance
advice and curiosity alike with a jest or a proverb if a little high
he liked them none the worse
joking continually as his manner was
we have seen mr
lincoln contemptuously compared to sancho panza by persons incapable of appreciating one of the deepest pieces of wisdom in the profoundest romance ever written namely
while don quixote was incomparable in theoretic and ideal statesmanship
with his stock of proverbs
the ready money of human experience
made the best possible practical governor
henry iv
was as full of wise saws and modern instances as mr
but beneath all this was the thoughtful
and thoroughly earnest man
around whom the fragments of france were to gather themselves till she took her place again as a planet of the first magnitude in the european system
in one respect mr
lincoln was more fortunate than henry
however some may think him wanting in zeal
the most fanatical can find no taint of apostasy in any measure of his
nor can the most bitter charge him with being influenced by motives of personal interest
the leading distinction between the policies of the two is one of circumstances
henry went over to the nation mr
lincoln has steadily drawn the nation over to him
one left a united france the other
we hope and believe
will leave a reunited america
we leave our readers to trace the further points of difference and resemblance for themselves
merely suggesting a general similarity which has often occurred to us
one only point of melancholy interest we will allow ourselves to touch upon
that mr
lincoln is not handsome nor elegant
we learn from certain english tourists who would consider similar revelations in regard to queen victoria as thoroughly american in the want of bienseance
it is no concern of ours
nor does it affect his fitness for the high place he so worthily occupies but he is certainly as fortunate as henry in the matter of good looks
if we may trust contemporary evidence
lincoln has also been reproached with americanism by some not unfriendly british critics but
with all deference
we cannot say that we like him any the worse for it
or see in it any reason why he should govern americans the less wisely
1 one of henry's titles was prince of bearn
that being the old province of france from which he came
people of more sensitive organizations may be shocked
but we are glad that in this our true war of independence
which is to free us forever from the old world
we have had at the head of our affairs a man whom america made
as god made adam
out of the very earth
to show us how much truth
how much magnanimity
and how much statecraft await the call of opportunity in simple manhood when it believes in the justice of god and the worth of man
conventionalities are all very well in their proper place
but they shrivel at the touch of nature like stubble in the fire
the genius that sways a nation by its arbitrary will seems less august to us than that which multiplies and reinforces itself in the instincts and convictions of an entire people
autocracy may have something in it more melodramatic than this
but falls far short of it in human value and interest
experience would have bred in us a rooted distrust of improved statesmanship
even if we did not believe politics to be a science
if it cannot always command men of special aptitude and great powers
at least demands the long and steady application of the best powers of such men as it can command to master even its first principles
it is curious
in a country which boasts of its intelligence the theory should be so generally held that the most complicated of human contrivances
and one which every day becomes more complicated
can be worked at sight by any man able to talk for an hour or two without stopping to think
lincoln is sometimes claimed as an example of a ready made ruler
but no case could well be less in point for
besides that he was a man of such fair mindedness as is always the raw material of wisdom
he had in his profession a training precisely the opposite of that to which a partisan is subjected
his experience as a lawyer compelled him not only to see that there is a principle underlying every phenomenon in human affairs
but that there are always two sides to every question
both of which must be fully understood in order to understand either
and that it is of greater advantage to an advocate to appreciate the strength than the weakness of his antagonist's position
nothing is more remarkable than the unerring tact with which
in his debate with mr
he went straight to the reason of the question nor have we ever had a more striking lesson in political tactics than the fact
that opposed to a man exceptionally adroit in using popular prejudice and bigotry to his purpose
exceptionally unscrupulous in appealing to those baser motives that turn a meeting of citizens into a mob of barbarians
he should yet have won his case before a jury of the people
lincoln was as far as possible from an impromptu politician
his wisdom was made up of a knowledge of things as well as of men his sagacity resulted from a clear perception and honest acknowledgment of difficulties
which enabled him to see that the only durable triumph of political opinion is based
not on any abstract right
but upon so much of justice
the highest attainable at any given moment in human affairs
as may be had in the balance of mutual concession
doubtless he had an ideal
but it was the ideal of a practical statesman
to aim at the best
and to take the next best
if he is lucky enough to get even that
his slow
but singularly masculine
intelligence taught him that precedent is only another name for embodied experience
and that it counts for even more in the guidance of communities of men than in that of the individual life
he was not a man who held it good public economy to pull down on the mere chance of rebuilding better
lincoln's faith in god was qualified by a very well founded distrust of the wisdom of man
perhaps it was his want of self confidence that more than anything else won him the unlimited confidence of the people
for they felt that there would be no need of retreat from any position he had deliberately taken
the cautious
but steady
advance of his policy during the war was like that of a roman army
he left behind him a firm road on which public confidence could follow he took america with him where he went what he gained he occupied
and his advanced posts became colonies
the very homeliness of his genius was its distinction
his kingship was conspicuous by its workday homespun
never was ruler so absolute as he
nor so little conscious of it for he was the incarnate common sense of the people
with all that tenderness of nature whose sweet sadness touched whoever saw him with something of its own pathos
there was no trace of sentimentalism in his speech or action
he seems to have had one rule of conduct
always that of practical and successful politics
to let himself be guided by events
when they were sure to bring him out where he wished to go
though by what seemed to unpractical minds
which let go the possible to grasp at the desirable
a longer road
undoubtedly the highest function of statesmanship is by degrees to accommodate the conduct of communities to ethical laws
and to subordinate the conflicting self interests of the day to higher and more permanent concerns
but it is on the understanding
and not on the sentiment
of a nation that all safe legislation must be based
voltaire's saying
that a consideration of petty circumstances is the tomb of great things
may be true of individual men
but it certainly is not true of governments
it is by a multitude of such considerations
each in itself trifling
but all together weighty
that the framers of policy can alone divine what is practicable and therefore wise
the imputation of inconsistency is one to which every sound politician and every honest thinker must sooner or later subject himself
the foolish and the dead alone never change their opinion
the course of a great statesman resembles that of navigable rivers
avoiding immovable obstacles with noble bends of concession
seeking the broad levels of opinion on which men soonest settle and longest dwell
following and marking the almost imperceptible slopes of national tendency
yet always aiming at direct advances
always recruited from sources nearer heaven
and sometimes bursting open paths of progress and fruitful human commerce through what seem the eternal barriers of both
it is loyalty to great ends
even though forced to combine the small and opposing motives of selfish men to accomplish them it is the anchored cling to solid principles of duty and action
which knows how to swing with the tide
but is never carried away by it
that we demand in public men
and not sameness of policy
or a conscientious persistency in what is impracticable
for the impracticable
however theoretically enticing
is always politically unwise
sound statesmanship being the application of that prudence to the public business which is the safest guide in that of private men
no doubt slavery was the most delicate and embarrassing question with which mr
lincoln was called on to deal
and it was one which no man in his position
whatever his opinions
could evade for
though he might withstand the clamor of partisans
he must sooner or later yield to the persistent importunacy of circumstances
which thrust the problem upon him at every turn and in every shape
it has been brought against us as an accusation abroad
and repeated here by people who measure their country rather by what is thought of it than by what is
that our war has not been distinctly and avowedly for the extinction of slavery
but a war rather for the preservation of our national power and greatness
in which the emancipation of the negro has been forced upon us by circumstances and accepted as a necessity
we are very far from denying this nay
we admit that it is so far true that we were slow to renounce our constitutional obligations even toward those who had absolved us by their own act from the letter of our duty
we are speaking of the government which
legally installed for the whole country
was bound
so long as it was possible
not to overstep the limits of orderly prescription
and could not
without abnegating its own very nature
take the lead off a virginia reel
they forgot
what should be forgotten least of all in a system like ours
that the administration for the time being represents not only the majority which elects it
but the minority as well
a minority in this case powerful
and so little ready for emancipation that it was opposed even to war
lincoln had not been chosen as general agent of the an anti slavery society
but president of the united states
to perform certain functions exactly defined by law
whatever were his wishes
it was no less duty than policy to mark out for himself a line of action that would not further distract the country
by raising before their time questions which plainly would soon enough compel attention
and for which every day was making the answer more easy
meanwhile he must solve the riddle of this new sphinx
or be devoured
though mr
lincoln's policy in this critical affair has not been such as to satisfy those who demand an heroic treatment for even the most trifling occasion
and who will not cut their coat according to their cloth
unless they can borrow the scissors of atropos
1 it has been at least not unworthy of the long headed king of ithaca
2 mr
lincoln had the choice of bassanio 3 offered him
which of the three caskets held the prize that was to redeem the fortunes of the country
there was the golden one whose showy speciousness might have tempted a vain man the silver of compromise
which might have decided the choice of a merely acute one and the leaden
dull and homely looking
as prudence always is
yet with something about it sure to attract the eye of practical wisdom
lincoln dallied with his decision perhaps longer than seemed needful to those on whom its awful responsibility was not to rest
but when he made it
it was worthy of his cautious but sure footed understanding
the moral of the sphinx riddle
and it is a deep one
lies in the childish simplicity of the solution
those who fail in guessing it
fail because they are over ingenious
and cast about for an answer that shall suit their own notion of the gravity of the occasion and of their own dignity
rather than the occasion itself
in a matter which must be finally settled by public opinion
and in regard to which the ferment of prejudice and passion on both sides has not yet subsided to that equilibrium of compromise from which alone a sound public opinion can result
it is proper enough for the private citizen to press his own convictions with all possible force of argument and persuasion but the popular magistrate
whose judgment must become action
and whose action involves the whole country
is bound to wait till the sentiment of the people is so far advanced toward his own point of view
that what he does shall find support in it
instead of merely confusing it with new elements of division
it was not unnatural that men earnestly devoted to the saving of their country
and profoundly convinced that slavery was its only real enemy
should demand a decided policy round which all patriots might rally
and this might have been the wisest course for an absolute ruler
but in the then unsettled state of the public mind
with a large party decrying even resistance to the slaveholders' rebellion as not only unwise
but even unlawful with a majority
even of the would be loyal so long accustomed to regard the constitution as a deed of gift conveying to the south their own judgment as to policy and instinct as to right
that they were in doubt at first whether their loyalty were due to the country or to slavery and with a respectable body of honest and influential men who still believed in the possibility of conciliation
lincoln judged wisely
in laying down a policy in deference to one party
he should be giving to the other the very fulcrum for which their disloyalty had been waiting
1 one of the three fates
2 odysseus
or ulysses
the hero of homer's odyssey
3 see shakespeare's merchant of venice
it behooved a clear headed man in his position not to yield so far to an honest indignation against the brokers of treason in the north as to lose sight of the materials for misleading which were their stock in trade
and to forget that it is not the falsehood of sophistry which is to be feared
but the grain of truth mingled with it to make it specious
that it is not the knavery of the leaders so much as the honesty of the followers they may seduce
that gives them power for evil
it was especially his duty to do nothing which might help the people to forget the true cause of the war in fruitless disputes about its inevitable consequences
the doctrine of state rights can be so handled by an adroit demagogue as easily to confound the distinction between liberty and lawlessness in the minds of ignorant persons
accustomed always to be influenced by the sound of certain words
rather than to reflect upon the principles which give them meaning
though secession involves the manifest absurdity of denying to the state the right of making war against any foreign power while permitting it against the united states though it supposes a compact of mutual concessions and guaranties among states without any arbiter in case of dissension though it contradicts common sense in assuming that the men who framed our government did not know what they meant when they substituted union for confederation though it falsifies history
which shows that the main opposition to the adoption of the constitution was based on the argument that it did not allow that independence in the several states which alone would justify them in seceding yet
as slavery was universally admitted to be a reserved right
an inference could be drawn from any direct attack upon it though only in self defence to a natural right of resistance
logical enough to satisfy minds untrained to detect fallacy
as the majority of men always are
and now too much disturbed by the disorder of the times
to consider that the order of events had any legitimate bearing on the argument
though mr
lincoln was too sagacious to give the northern allies of the rebels the occasion they desired and even strove to provoke
yet from the beginning of the war the most persistent efforts have been made to confuse the public mind as to its origin and motives
and to drag the people of the loyal states down from the national position they had instinctively taken to the old level of party squabbles and antipathies
the wholly unprovoked rebellion of an oligarchy proclaiming negro slavery the corner stone of free institutions
and in the first flush of over hasty confidence venturing to parade the logical sequence of their leading dogma
that slavery is right in principle
and has nothing to do with difference of complexion
has been represented as a legitimate and gallant attempt to maintain the true principles of democracy
the rightful endeavor of an established government
the least onerous that ever existed
to defend itself against a treacherous attack on its very existence
has been cunningly made to seem the wicked effort of a fanatical clique to force its doctrines on an oppressed population
even so long ago as when mr
not yet convinced of the danger and magnitude of the crisis
was endeavoring to persuade himself of union majorities at the south
and to carry on a war that was half peace in the hope of a peace that would have been all war
while he was still enforcing the fugitive slave law
under some theory that secession
however it might absolve states from their obligations
could not escheat them of their claims under the constitution
and that slaveholders in rebellion had alone among mortals the privilege of having their cake and eating it at the same time
the enemies of free government were striving to persuade the people that the war was an abolition crusade
to rebel without reason was proclaimed as one of the rights of man
while it was carefully kept out of sight that to suppress rebellion is the first duty of government
all the evils that have come upon the country have been attributed to the abolitionists
though it is hard to see how any party can become permanently powerful except in one of two ways
either by the greater truth of its principles
or the extravagance of the party opposed to it
to fancy the ship of state
riding safe at her constitutional moorings
suddenly engulfed by a huge kraken of abolitionism
rising from unknown depths and grasping it with slimy tentacles
is to look at the natural history of the matter with the eyes of pontoppidan
1 to believe that the leaders in the southern treason feared any danger from abolitionism
would be to deny them ordinary intelligence
though there can be little doubt that they made use of it to stir the passions and excite the fears of their deluded accomplices
they rebelled
not because they thought slavery weak
but because they believed it strong enough
not to overthrow the government
but to get possession of it for it becomes daily clearer that they used rebellion only as a means of revolution
and if they got revolution
though not in the shape they looked for
is the american people to save them from its consequences at the cost of its own existence
the election of mr
which it was clearly in their power to prevent had they wished
was the occasion merely
and not the cause of their revolt
till within a year or two
was the despised heresy of a few earnest persons
without political weight enough to carry the election of a parish constable and their cardinal principle was disunion
because they were convinced that within the union the position of slavery was impregnable
in spite of the proverb
great effects do not follow from small causes
that is
disproportionately small
but from adequate causes acting under certain required conditions
to contrast the size of the oak with that of the parent acorn
as if the poor seed had paid all costs from its slender strong box
may serve for a child's wonder but the real miracle lies in that divine league which bound all the forces of nature to the service of the tiny germ in fulfilling its destiny
everything has been at work for the past ten years in the cause of anti slavery
but garrison and phillips have been far less successful propagandists than the slaveholders themselves
with the constantly growing arrogance of their pretensions and encroachments
they have forced the question upon the attention of every voter in the free states
by defiantly putting freedom and democracy on the defensive
even after the kansas outrages
there was no wide spread desire on the part of the north to commit aggressions
though there was a growing determination to resist them
the popular unanimity in favor of the war three years ago was but in small measure the result of anti slavery sentiment
far less of any zeal for abolition
but every month of the war
every movement of the allies of slavery in the free states
has been making abolitionists by the thousand
the masses of any people
however intelligent
are very little moved by abstract principles of humanity and justice
until those principles are interpreted for them by the stinging commentary of some infringement upon their own rights
and then their instincts and passions
once aroused
do indeed derive an incalculable reinforcement of impulse and intensity from those higher ideas
those sublime traditions
which have no motive political force till they are allied with a sense of immediate personal wrong or imminent peril
then at last the stars in their courses begin to fight against sisera
had any one doubted before that the rights of human nature are unitary
that oppression is of one hue the world over
no matter what the color of the oppressed
had any one failed to see what the real essence of the contest was
the efforts of the advocates of slavery among ourselves to throw discredit upon the fundamental axioms of the declaration of independence and the radical doctrines of christianity
could not fail to sharpen his eyes
1 a danish antiquary and theologian
while every day was bringing the people nearer to the conclusion which all thinking men saw to be inevitable from the beginning
it was wise in mr
lincoln to leave the shaping of his policy to events
in this country
where the rough and ready understanding of the people is sure at last to be the controlling power
a profound common sense is the best genius for statesmanship
hitherto the wisdom of the president's measures has been justified by the fact that they have always resulted in more firmly uniting public opinion
one of the things particularly admirable in the public utterances of president lincoln is a certain tone of familiar dignity
while it is perhaps the most difficult attainment of mere style
is also no doubtful indication of personal character
there must be something essentially noble in an elective ruler who can descend to the level of confidential ease without losing respect
something very manly in one who can break through the etiquette of his conventional rank and trust himself to the reason and intelligence of those who have elected him
no higher compliment was ever paid to a nation than the simple confidence
the fireside plainness
with which mr
lincoln always addresses himself to the reason of the american people
this was
a true democrat
who grounded himself on the assumption that a democracy can think
let us reason together about this matter
has been the tone of all his addresses to the people and accordingly we have never had a chief magistrate who so won to himself the love and at the same time the judgment of his countrymen
to us
that simple confidence of his in the right mindedness of his fellowmen is very touching
and its success is as strong an argument as we have ever seen in favor of the theory that men can govern themselves
he never appeals to any vulgar sentiment
he never alludes to the humbleness of his origin it probably never occurred to him
that there was anything higher to start from than manhood and he put himself on a level with those he addressed
not by going down to them
but only by taking it for granted that they had brains and would come up to a common ground of reason
in an article lately printed in the nation
mr
bayard taylor mentions the striking fact
that in the foulest dens of the five points he found the portrait of lincoln
the wretched population that makes its hive there threw all its votes and more against him
and yet paid this instinctive tribute to the sweet humanity of his nature
their ignorance sold its vote and took its money
but all that was left of manhood in them recognized its saint and martyr
lincoln is not in the habit of saying
this is my opinion
or my theory
but this is the conclusion to which
in my judgment
the time has come
and to which
the sooner we come the better for us
his policy has been the policy of public opinion based on adequate discussion and on a timely recognition of the influence of passing events in shaping the features of events to come
one secret of mr
lincoln's remarkable success in captivating the popular mind is undoubtedly an unconsciousness of self which enables him
though under the necessity of constantly using the capital i
to do it without any suggestion of egotism
there is no single vowel which men's mouths can pronounce with such difference of effect
that which one shall hide away
as it were
behind the substance of his discourse
if he bring it to the front
shall use merely to give an agreeable accent of individuality to what he says
another shall make an offensive challenge to the self satisfaction of all his hearers
and an unwarranted intrusion upon each man's sense of personal importance
irritating every pore of his vanity
like a dry northeast wind
to a goose flesh of opposition and hostility
lincoln has never studied quintilian 1 but he has
in the earnest simplicity and unaffected americanism of his own character
one art of oratory worth all the rest
he forgets himself so entirely in his object as to give his i the sympathetic and persuasive effect of we with the great body of his countrymen
showing all the rough edged process of his thought as it goes along
yet arriving at his conclusions with an honest kind of every day logic
he is so eminently our representative man
when he speaks
it seems as if the people were listening to their own thinking aloud
the dignity of his thought owes nothing to any ceremonial garb of words
but to the manly movement that comes of settled purpose and an energy of reason that knows not what rhetoric means
there has been nothing of cleon
still less of strepsiades 2 striving to underbid him in demagogism
to be found in the public utterances of mr
he has always addressed the intelligence of men
never their prejudice
their passion
or their ignorance
1 a famous latin writer on the art of oratory
2 two athenian demagogues
satirized by the dramatist aristophanes
on the day of his death
this simple western attorney
who according to one party was a vulgar joker
and whom the doctrinaires among his own supporters accused of wanting every element of statesmanship
was the most absolute ruler in christendom
and this solely by the hold his good humored sagacity had laid on the hearts and understandings of his countrymen
nor was this all
for it appeared that he had drawn the great majority
not only of his fellow citizens
but of mankind also
to his side
so strong and so persuasive is honest manliness without a single quality of romance or unreal sentiment to help it
a civilian during times of the most captivating military achievement
with no skill in the lower technicalities of manners
he left behind him a fame beyond that of any conqueror
the memory of a grace higher than that of outward person
and of a gentlemanliness deeper than mere breeding
never before that startled april morning did such multitudes of men shed tears for the death of one they had never seen
as if with him a friendly presence had been taken away from their lives
leaving them colder and darker
never was funeral panegyric so eloquent as the silent look of sympathy which strangers exchanged when they met on that day
their common manhood had lost a kinsman
lincoln's first inaugural address march 4
1861 fellow citizens of the united states
in compliance with a custom as old as the government itself
i appear before you to address you briefly and to take
in your presence
the oath prescribed by the constitution of the united states
to be taken by the president before he enters on the execution of his office
i do not consider it necessary
at present
for me to discuss those matters of administration about which there is no special anxiety
or excitement
apprehension seems to exist among the people of the southern states that by the accession of a republican administration their property and their peace and personal security are to be endangered
there has never been any reasonable cause for such apprehension
the most ample evidence to the contrary has all the while existed and been open to their inspection
it is found in nearly all the published speeches of him who now addresses you
i do but quote from one of those speeches when i declare that i have no purpose
directly or indirectly
to interfere with the institution of slavery where it exists
i believe i have no lawful right to do so
and i have no inclination to do so
those who nominated and elected me did so with full knowledge that i had made this and many similar declarations
and had never recanted them
more than this
they placed in the platform for my acceptance
and as a law to themselves and to me
the clear and emphatic resolution which i now read
that the maintenance inviolate of the rights of the states
and especially the right of each state to order and control its own domestic institutions according to its own judgment exclusively
is essential to that balance of power on which the perfection and endurance of our political fabric depend
and we denounce the lawless invasion by armed force of the soil of any state or territory
no matter under what pretext
as among the gravest of crimes
i now reiterate these sentiments and
in doing so
i only press upon the public attention the most conclusive evidence of which the case is susceptible
that the property
and security of no section are to be in any wise endangered by the now incoming administration
i add
that all the protection which
consistently with the constitution and the laws
can be given
will be cheerfully given to all the states when lawfully demanded
for whatever cause as cheerfully to one section as to another
there is much controversy about the delivering up of fugitives from service or labor
the clause i now read is as plainly written in the constitution as any other of its provisions
no person held to service or labor in one state
under the laws thereof
escaping into another
shall in consequence of any law or regulation therein be discharged from such service or labor
but shall be delivered up on claim of the party to whom such service or labor may be due
it is scarcely questioned that this provision was intended by those who made it for the reclaiming of what we call fugitive slaves and the intention of the lawgiver is the law
all members of congress swear their support to the whole constitution to this provision as much as to any other
to the proposition
that slaves whose cases come within the terms of this clause shall be delivered up
their oaths are unanimous
if they would make the effort in good temper
could they not with nearly equal unanimity frame and pass a law by means of which to keep good that unanimous oath
there is some difference of opinion whether this clause should be enforced by national or by state authority but surely that difference is not a very material one
if the slave is to be surrendered
it can be of but little consequence to him or to others by which authority it is done
and should any one in any case be content that his oath shall go unkept on a merely unsubstantial controversy as to how it shall be kept
in any law upon this subject
ought not all the safeguards of liberty known in civilized and humane jurisprudence to be introduced
so that a free man be not
in any case
surrendered as a slave
and might it not be well at the same time to provide by law for the enforcement of that clause in the constitution which guarantees that the citizen of each state shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of citizens in the several states
i take the official oath today with no mental reservations
and with no purpose to construe the constitution or laws by any hypercritical rules
and while i do not choose now to specify particular acts of congress as proper to be enforced
i do suggest that it will be much safer for all
both in official and private stations
to conform to and abide by all those acts which stand unrepealed
than to violate any of them
trusting to find impunity in having them held to be unconstitutional
it is seventy two years since the first inauguration of a president under our national constitution
during that period fifteen different and greatly distinguished citizens have
in succession
administered the executive branch of the government
they have conducted it through many perils
and generally with great success
with all this scope of precedent
i now enter upon the same task for the brief constitutional term of four years under great and peculiar difficulty
a disruption of the federal union
heretofore only menaced
is now formidably attempted
i hold that
in contemplation of universal law and of the constitution
the union of these states is perpetual
perpetuity is implied
if not expressed
in the fundamental law of all national governments
it is safe to assert that no government proper ever had a provision in its organic law for its own termination
continue to execute all the express provisions of our national constitution
and the union will endure forever it being impossible to destroy it except by some action not provided for in the instrument itself
if the united states be not a government proper
but an association of states in the nature of contract merely
can it
as a contract
be peaceably unmade by less than all the parties who made it
one party to a contract may violate it break it
so to speak but does it not require all to lawfully rescind it
descending from these general principles
we find the proposition that in legal contemplation the union is perpetual confirmed by the history of the union itself
the union is much older than the constitution
it was formed
in fact
by the articles of association in 1774
it was matured and continued by the declaration of independence in 1776
it was further matured
and the faith of all the then thirteen states expressly plighted and engaged that it should be perpetual
by the articles of confederation in 1778
in 1787 one of the declared objects for ordaining and establishing the constitution was to form a more perfect union
but if the destruction of the union by one or by a part only of the states be lawfully possible
the union is less perfect than before the constitution
having lost the vital element of perpetuity
it follows from these views that no state upon its own mere motion can lawfully get out of the union that resolves and ordinances to that effect are legally void and that acts of violence
within any state or states
against the authority of the united states
are insurrectionary or revolutionary
according to circumstances
i therefore consider that
in view of the constitution and the laws
the union is unbroken and to the extent of my ability i shall take care
as the constitution itself expressly enjoins upon me
that the laws of the union be faithfully executed in all the states
doing this i deem to be only a simple duty on my part and i shall perform it so far as practicable
unless my rightful masters
the american people
shall withhold the requisite means
or in some authoritative manner direct the contrary
i trust this will not be regarded as a menace
but only as the declared purpose of the union that it will constitutionally defend and maintain itself
in doing this there needs to be no bloodshed or violence and there shall be none
unless it be forced upon the national authority
the power confided to me will be used to hold
and possess the property and places belonging to the government
and to collect the duties and imposts but beyond what may be necessary for these objects
there will be no invasion
no using of force against or among the people anywhere
where hostility to the united states
in any interior locality
shall be so great and universal as to prevent competent resident citizens from holding the federal offices
there will be no attempt to force obnoxious strangers among the people for that object
while the strict legal right may exist in the government to enforce the exercise of these offices
the attempt to do so would be so irritating
and so nearly impracticable withal
that i deem it better to forego for the time the uses of such offices
the mails
unless repelled
will continue to be furnished in all parts of the union
so far as possible
the people everywhere shall have that sense of perfect security which is most favorable to calm thought and reflection
the course here indicated will be followed unless current events and experience shall show a modification or change to be proper
and in every case and exigency my best discretion will be exercised according to circumstances actually existing
and with a view and a hope of a peaceful solution of the national troubles and the restoration of fraternal sympathies and affections
that there are persons in one section or another who seek to destroy the union at all events
and are glad of any pretext to do it
i will neither affirm nor deny but if there be such
i need address no word to them
to those
who really love the union may i not speak
before entering upon so grave a matter as the destruction of our national fabric
with all its benefits
its memories
and its hopes
would it not be wise to ascertain precisely why we do it
will you hazard so desperate a step while there is any possibility that any portion of the ills you fly from have no real existence
will you
while the certain ills you fly to are greater than all the real ones you fly from will you risk the commission of so fearful a mistake
all profess to be content in the union if all constitutional rights can be maintained
is it true
that any right
plainly written in the constitution
has been denied
i think not
happily the human mind is so constituted that no party can reach to the audacity of doing this
if you can
of a single instance in which a plainly written provision of the constitution has ever been denied
if by the mere force of numbers a majority should deprive a minority of any clearly written constitutional right
it might
in a moral point of view
justify revolution certainly would if such a right were a vital one
but such is not our case
all the vital rights of minorities and of individuals are so plainly assured to them by affirmations and negations
guaranties and prohibitions
in the constitution
that controversies never arise concerning them
but no organic law can ever be framed with a provision specifically applicable to every question which may occur in practical administration
no foresight can anticipate
nor any document of reasonable length contain
express provisions for all possible questions
shall fugitives from labor be surrendered by national or state authority
the constitution does not expressly say
may congress prohibit slavery in the territories
the constitution does not expressly say
must congress protect slavery in the territories
the constitution does not expressly say
from questions of this class spring all our constitutional controversies
and we divide upon them into majorities and minorities
if the minority will not acquiesce
the majority must
or the government must cease
there is no other alternative for continuing the government is acquiescence on one side or the other
if a minority in such case will secede rather than acquiesce
they make a precedent which in turn will divide and ruin them for a minority of their own will secede from them whenever a majority refuses to be controlled by such minority
for instance
why may not any portion of a new confederacy a year or two hence arbitrarily secede again
precisely as portions of the present union now claim to secede from it
all who cherish disunion sentiments are now being educated to the exact temper of doing this
is there such perfect identity of interests among the states to compose a new union
as to produce harmony only
and prevent renewed secession
the central idea of secession is the essence of anarchy
a majority held in restraint by constitutional checks and limitations
and always changing easily with deliberate changes of popular opinions and sentiments
is the only true sovereign of a free people
whoever rejects it does
of necessity
fly to anarchy or to despotism
unanimity is impossible the rule of a minority
as a permanent arrangement
is wholly inadmissible so that
rejecting the majority principle
anarchy or despotism in some form is all that is left
i do not forget the position
assumed by some
that constitutional questions are to be decided by the supreme court nor do i deny that such decisions must be binding
in any case
upon the parties to a suit
as to the object of that suit
while they are also entitled to very high respect and consideration in all parallel cases by all other departments of the government
and while it is obviously possible that such decision may be erroneous in any given case
still the evil effect following it
being limited to that particular case
with the chance that it may be overruled and never become a precedent for other cases
can better be borne than could the evils of a different practice
at the same time
the candid citizen must confess that if the policy of the government
upon vital questions affecting the whole people
is to be irrevocably fixed by decisions of the supreme court
the instant they are made
in ordinary litigation between parties in personal actions
the people will have ceased to be their own rulers
having to that extent practically resigned their government into the hands of that eminent tribunal
nor is there in this view any assault upon the court or the judges
it is a duty from which they may not shrink to decide cases properly brought before them
and it is no fault of theirs if others seek to turn their decisions to political purposes
one section of our country believes slavery is right
and ought to be extended
while the other believes it is wrong
and ought not to be extended
this is the only substantial dispute
the fugitive slave clause of the constitution
and the law for the suppression of the foreign slave trade
are each as well enforced
as any law can ever be in a community where the moral sense of the people imperfectly supports the law itself
the great body of the people abide by the dry legal obligation in both cases
and a few break over in each
i think
cannot be perfectly cured and it would be worse in both cases after the separation of the sections than before
the foreign slave trade
now imperfectly suppressed
would be ultimately revived
without restriction
in one section
while fugitive slaves
now only partially surrendered
would not be surrendered at all by the other
physically speaking
we cannot separate
we cannot remove our respective sections from each other
nor build an impassable wall between them
a husband and wife may be divorced
and go out of the presence and beyond the reach of each other but the different parts of our country cannot do this
they cannot but remain face to face
and intercourse
either amicable or hostile
must continue between them
is it possible
to make that intercourse more advantageous or more satisfactory after separation than before
can aliens make treaties easier than friends can make laws
can treaties be more faithfully enforced between aliens than laws can among friends
suppose you go to war
you cannot fight always and when
after much loss on both sides
an no gain on either
you cease fighting
the identical old questions as to terms of intercourse are again upon you
this country
with its institutions
belongs to the people who inhabit it
whenever they shall grow weary of the existing government
they can exercise their constitutional right of amending it
or their revolutionary right to dismember or overthrow it
i cannot be ignorant of the fact that many worthy and patriotic citizens are desirous of having the national constitution amended
while i make no recommendation of amendments
i fully recognize the rightful authority of the people over the whole subject
to be exercised in either of the modes prescribed in the instrument itself and i should
under existing circumstances
favor rather than oppose a fair opportunity being afforded the people to act upon it
i will venture to add that to me the convention mode seems preferable
in that it allows amendments to originate with the people themselves
instead of only permitting them to take or reject propositions originated by others not especially chosen for the purpose
and which might not be precisely such as they would wish to either accept or refuse
i understand a proposed amendment to the constitution which amendment
i have not seen has passed congress
to the effect that the federal government shall never interfere with the domestic institutions of the states
including that of persons held to service
to avoid misconstruction of what i have said
i depart from my purpose not to speak of particular amendments so far as to say that
holding such a provision to now be implied constitutional law
i have no objection to its being made express and irrevocable
the chief magistrate derives all his authority from the people
and they have conferred none upon him to fix terms for the separation of the states
the people themselves can do this also if they choose but the executive
as such
has nothing to do with it
his duty is to administer the present government
as it came to his hands
and to transmit it
unimpaired by him
to his successor
why should there not be a patient confidence in the ultimate justice of the people
is there any better or equal hope in the world
in our present differences is either party without faith of being in the right
if the almighty ruler of nations
with his eternal truth and justice
be on your side of the north
or on yours of the south
that truth and that justice will surely prevail
by the judgment of this great tribunal
the american people
by the frame of the government under which we live
this same people have wisely given their public servants but little power for mischief and have
with equal wisdom
provided for the return of that little to their own hands at very short intervals
while the people retain their virtue and vigilance
no administration
by any extreme of wickedness or folly
can very seriously injure the government in the short space of four years
my countrymen
one and all
think calmly and well upon this whole subject
nothing valuable can be lost by taking time
if there be an object to hurry any of you in hot haste to a step which you would never take deliberately
that object will be frustrated by taking time but no good object can be frustrated by it
such of you as are now dissatisfied
still have the old constitution unimpaired
on the sensitive point
the laws of your own framing under it while the new administration will have no immediate power
if it would
to change either
if it were admitted that you who are dissatisfied hold the right side in the dispute
there still is no single good reason for precipitate action
and a firm reliance on him who has never yet forsaken this favored land
are still competent to adjust in the best way all our present difficulty
in your hands
my dissatisfied fellow countrymen
and not in mine
is the momentous issue of civil war
the government will not assail you
you can have no conflict without being yourselves the aggressors
you have no oath registered in heaven to destroy the government
while i shall have the most solemn one to preserve
and defend it
i am loathe to close
we are not enemies
but friends
we must not be enemies
though passion may have strained
it must not break our bonds of affection
the mystic chords of memory
stretching from every battlefield and patriot grave to every living heart and hearthstone all over this broad land
will yet swell the chorus of the union when again touched
as surely they will be
by the better angels of our nature

there was no opening to nominate him for superintendent of public instruction
but through him egypt made a most valuable contribution to the convention
i think it may be fairly said that he came off the lion of the day or rather of the night
can you not elect him to the legislature
it seems to me he would be hard to beat
what objection could be made to him

yours of the 22nd
inclosing a draft of two hundred dollars
was duly received
i have paid it on the judgment
and herewith you have the receipt
i do not wish to say anything as to who shall be the republican candidate for the legislature in your district
further than that i have full confidence in dr
have you ever got in the way of consulting with mckinley in political matters
he is true as steel
and his judgment is very good
the last i heard from him
he rather thought weldon
of de witt
was our best timber for representative
all things considered
but you there must settle it among yourselves
it may well puzzle older heads than yours to understand how
as the dred scott decision holds
congress can authorize a territorial legislature to do everything else
and cannot authorize them to prohibit slavery
that is one of the things the court can decide
but can never give an intelligible reason for
yours very truly

you beat them 179

if our friends get 1000 of the fillmore votes

we win by just two votes

my dear sir
your kind and interesting letter of the 19th was duly received
your suggestions as to placing one's self on the offensive rather than the defensive are certainly correct
that is a point which i shall not disregard
i spoke here on saturday night
the speech
not very well reported
appears in the state journal of this morning
you doubtless will see it and i hope that you will perceive in it that i am already improving
i would mail you a copy now
but have not one at hand
i thank you for your letter and shall be pleased to hear from you again
yours very truly

my dear sir
your doleful letter of the 8th was received on my return from chicago last night
i do hope you are worse scared than hurt
though you ought to know best
we must not lose the district
we must make a job of it
and save it
lay hold of the proper agencies
and secure all the americans you can
at once
i do hope
on closer inspection
you will find they are not half gone
make a little test
run down one of the poll books of the edwardsville precinct
and take the first hundred known american names
then quietly ascertain how many of them are actually going for douglas
i think you will find less than fifty
but even if you find fifty
make sure of the other fifty
that is
make sure of all you can
at all events
we will set other agencies to work which shall compensate for the loss of a good many americans
don't fail to check the stampede at once
i think
will be with you before long
there is much he cannot do
and some he can
i have reason to hope there will be other help of an appropriate kind
write me again

if they can only get the encouragement of our folks nominating pretty extreme abolitionists
it is thought they will do nothing if our folks nominate men who are not very obnoxious to the charge of abolitionism

give full notice to all surrounding country
fragment of speech at paris
let us inquire what judge douglas really invented when he introduced the nebraska bill
he called it popular sovereignty
what does that mean
it means the sovereignty of the people over their own affairs in other words
the right of the people to govern themselves
did judge douglas invent this
not quite
the idea of popular sovereignty was floating about several ages before the author of the nebraska bill was born indeed
before columbus set foot on this continent
in the year 1776 it took form in the noble words which you are all familiar with
we hold these truths to be self evident
that all men are created equal
etc
was not this the origin of popular sovereignty as applied to the american people
here we are told that governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed
if that is not popular sovereignty
then i have no conception of the meaning of words
if judge douglas did not invent this kind of popular sovereignty
let us pursue the inquiry and find out what kind he did invent
was it the right of emigrants to kansas and nebraska to govern themselves
and a lot of niggers
too
if they wanted them
clearly this was no invention of his because general cass put forth the same doctrine in 1848 in his so called nicholson letter
six years before douglas thought of such a thing
then what was it that the little giant invented
it never occurred to general cass to call his discovery by the odd name of popular sovereignty
he had not the face to say that the right of the people to govern niggers was the right of the people to govern themselves
his notions of the fitness of things were not moulded to the brazenness of calling the right to put a hundred niggers through under the lash in nebraska a sacred right of self government
and here i submit to you was judge douglas's discovery
and the whole of it
he discovered that the right to breed and flog negroes in nebraska was popular sovereignty
speech at clinton
september 8
the questions are sometimes asked what is all this fuss that is being made about negroes
what does it amount to
and where will it end
these questions imply that those who ask them consider the slavery question a very insignificant matter they think that it amounts to little or nothing and that those who agitate it are extremely foolish
now it must be admitted that if the great question which has caused so much trouble is insignificant
we are very foolish to have anything to do with it if it is of no importance we had better throw it aside and busy ourselves with something else
but let us inquire a little into this insignificant matter
as it is called by some
and see if it is not important enough to demand the close attention of every well wisher of the union
in one of douglas's recent speeches
i find a reference to one which was made by me in springfield some time ago
the judge makes one quotation from that speech that requires some little notice from me at this time
i regret that i have not my springfield speech before me
but the judge has quoted one particular part of it so often that i think i can recollect it
it runs i think as follows
we are now far into the fifth year since a policy was initiated with the avowed object and confident promise of putting an end to slavery agitation
under the operation of that policy that agitation has not only not ceased but has constantly augmented
in my opinion it will not cease until a crisis shall have been reached and passed
a house divided against itself cannot stand
i believe this government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free
i do not expect the union to be dissolved
i do not expect the house to fall
but i do expect it will cease to be divided
it will become all one thing or all the other
either the opponents of slavery will arrest the further spread of it and place it where the public mind shall rest in the belief that it is in the course of ultimate extinction or its advocates will push it forward till it shall become alike lawful in all the states
old as well as new
north as well as south
judge douglas makes use of the above quotation
and finds a great deal of fault with it
he deals unfairly with me
and tries to make the people of this state believe that i advocated dangerous doctrines in my springfield speech
let us see if that portion of my springfield speech of which judge douglas complains so bitterly
is as objectionable to others as it is to him
we are
far into the fifth year since a policy was initiated with the avowed object and confident promise of putting an end to slavery agitation
on the fourth day of january
judge douglas introduced the kansas nebraska bill
he initiated a new policy
and that policy
so he says
was to put an end to the agitation of the slavery question
whether that was his object or not i will not stop to discuss
but at all events some kind of a policy was initiated and what has been the result
instead of the quiet and good feeling which were promised us by the self styled author of popular sovereignty
we have had nothing but ill feeling and agitation
according to judge douglas
the passage of the nebraska bill would tranquilize the whole country there would be no more slavery agitation in or out of congress
and the vexed question would be left entirely to the people of the territories
such was the opinion of judge douglas
and such were the opinions of the leading men of the democratic party
even as late as the spring of 1856 mr
buchanan said
a short time subsequent to his nomination by the cincinnati convention
that the territory of kansas would be tranquil in less than six weeks
perhaps he thought so
but kansas has not been and is not tranquil
and it may be a long time before she may be so
we all know how fierce the agitation was in congress last winter
and what a narrow escape kansas had from being admitted into the union with a constitution that was detested by ninety nine hundredths of her citizens
did the angry debates which took place at washington during the last season of congress lead you to suppose that the slavery agitation was settled
an election was held in kansas in the month of august
and the constitution which was submitted to the people was voted down by a large majority
so kansas is still out of the union
and there is a probability that she will remain out for some time
but judge douglas says the slavery question is settled
he says the bill he introduced into the senate of the united states on the 4th day of january
settled the slavery question forever
perhaps he can tell us how that bill settled the slavery question
for if he is able to settle a question of such great magnitude he ought to be able to explain the manner in which he does it
he knows and you know that the question is not settled
and that his ill timed experiment to settle it has made it worse than it ever was before
and now let me say a few words in regard to douglas's great hobby of negro equality
he thinks he says at least that the republican party is in favor of allowing whites and blacks to intermarry
and that a man can't be a good republican unless he is willing to elevate black men to office and to associate with them on terms of perfect equality
he knows that we advocate no such doctrines as these
but he cares not how much he misrepresents us if he can gain a few votes by so doing
to show you what my opinion of negro equality was in times past
and to prove to you that i stand on that question where i always stood
i will read you a few extracts from a speech that was made by me in peoria in 1854
it was made in reply to one of judge douglas's speeches
lincoln then read a number of extracts which had the ring of the true metal
we have rarely heard anything with which we have been more pleased
and the audience after hearing the extracts read
and comparing their conservative sentiments with those now advocated by mr
testified their approval by loud applause
how any reasonable man can hear one of mr
lincoln's speeches without being converted to republicanism is something that we can't account for
slavery
continued mr
is not a matter of little importance
it overshadows every other question in which we are interested
it has divided the methodist and presbyterian churches
and has sown discord in the american tract society
the churches have split and the society will follow their example before long
so it will be seen that slavery is agitated in the religious as well as in the political world
judge douglas is very much afraid in the triumph that the republican party will lead to a general mixture of the white and black races
perhaps i am wrong in saying that he is afraid
so i will correct myself by saying that he pretends to fear that the success of our party will result in the amalgamation of the blacks and whites
i think i can show plainly
from documents now before me
that judge douglas's fears are groundless
the census of 1800 tells us that in that year there were over four hundred thousand mulattoes in the united states
now let us take what is called an abolition state the republican
slavery hating state of new hampshire and see how many mulattoes we can find within her borders
the number amounts to just one hundred and eighty four
in the old dominion in the democratic and aristocratic state of virginia there were a few more mulattoes than the census takers found in new hampshire
how many do you suppose there were
seventy nine thousand
seven hundred and seventy five twenty three thousand more than there were in all the free states
in the slave states there were in 1800
three hundred and forty eight thousand mulattoes all of home production and in the free states there were less than sixty thousand mulattoes and a large number of them were imported from the south
fragment of speech at edwardsville
i have been requested to give a concise statement of the difference
as i understand it
between the democratic and republican parties
on the leading issues of the campaign
this question has been put to me by a gentleman whom i do not know
i do not even know whether he is a friend of mine or a supporter of judge douglas in this contest
nor does that make any difference
his question is a proper one
lest i should forget it
i will give you my answer before proceeding with the line of argument i have marked out for this discussion
the difference between the republican and the democratic parties on the leading issues of this contest
as i understand it
is that the former consider slavery a moral
social and political wrong
while the latter do not consider it either a moral
a social or a political wrong and the action of each
as respects the growth of the country and the expansion of our population
is squared to meet these views
i will not affirm that the democratic party consider slavery morally
socially and politically right
though their tendency to that view has
in my opinion
been constant and unmistakable for the past five years
i prefer to take
as the accepted maxim of the party
the idea put forth by judge douglas
that he don't care whether slavery is voted down or voted up
i am quite willing to believe that many democrats would prefer that slavery should be always voted down
and i know that some prefer that it be always voted up but i have a right to insist that their action
especially if it be their constant action
shall determine their ideas and preferences on this subject
every measure of the democratic party of late years
bearing directly or indirectly on the slavery question
has corresponded with this notion of utter indifference whether slavery or freedom shall outrun in the race of empire across to the pacific every measure
i say
up to the dred scott decision
it seems to me
the idea is boldly suggested that slavery is better than freedom
the republican party
on the contrary
hold that this government was instituted to secure the blessings of freedom
and that slavery is an unqualified evil to the negro
to the white man
to the soil
and to the state
regarding it as an evil
they will not molest it in the states where it exists
they will not overlook the constitutional guards which our fathers placed around it they will do nothing that can give proper offence to those who hold slaves by legal sanction but they will use every constitutional method to prevent the evil from becoming larger and involving more negroes
more white men
more soil
and more states in its deplorable consequences
they will
if possible
place it where the public mind shall rest in the belief that it is in course of ultimate peaceable extinction in god's own good time
and to this end they will
if possible
restore the government to the policy of the fathers
the policy of preserving the new territories from the baneful influence of human bondage
as the northwestern territories were sought to be preserved by the ordinance of 1787
and the compromise act of 1820
they will oppose
in all its length and breadth
the modern democratic idea
that slavery is as good as freedom
and ought to have room for expansion all over the continent
if people can be found to carry it
or nearly all
of judge douglas's arguments are logical
if you admit that slavery is as good and as right as freedom
and not one of them is worth a rush if you deny it
this is the difference
as i understand it
between the republican and democratic parties
my friends
i have endeavored to show you the logical consequences of the dred scott decision
which holds that the people of a territory cannot prevent the establishment of slavery in their midst
i have stated what cannot be gainsaid
that the grounds upon which this decision is made are equally applicable to the free states as to the free territories
and that the peculiar reasons put forth by judge douglas for indorsing this decision commit him
in advance
to the next decision and to all other decisions corning from the same source
and when
by all these means
you have succeeded in dehumanizing the negro when you have put him down and made it impossible for him to be but as the beasts of the field when you have extinguished his soul in this world and placed him where the ray of hope is blown out as in the darkness of the damned
are you quite sure that the demon you have roused will not turn and rend you
what constitutes the bulwark of our own liberty and independence
it is not our frowning battlements
our bristling sea coasts
our army and our navy
these are not our reliance against tyranny all of those may be turned against us without making us weaker for the struggle
our reliance is in the love of liberty which god has planted in us
our defense is in the spirit which prizes liberty as the heritage of all men
in all lands everywhere
destroy this spirit and you have planted the seeds of despotism at your own doors
familiarize yourselves with the chains of bondage and you prepare your own limbs to wear them
accustomed to trample on the rights of others
you have lost the genius of your own independence and become the fit subjects of the first cunning tyrant who rises among you
and let me tell you
that all these things are prepared for you by the teachings of history
if the elections shall promise that the next dred scott decision and all future decisions will be quietly acquiesced in by the people

my dear sir
i do not perceive how i can express myself more plainly than i have in the fore going extracts
in four of them i have expressly disclaimed all intention to bring about social and political equality between the white and black races and in all the rest i have done the same thing by clear implication
i have made it equally plain that i think the negro is included in the word men used in the declaration of independence
i believe the declaration that all men are created equal is the great fundamental principle upon which our free institutions rest that negro slavery is violative of that principle but that
by our frame of government
that principle has not been made one of legal obligation that by our frame of government
states which have slavery are to retain it
or surrender it at their own pleasure and that all others individuals
free states and national government are constitutionally bound to leave them alone about it
i believe our government was thus framed because of the necessity springing from the actual presence of slavery
when it was framed
that such necessity does not exist in the territories when slavery is not present
in his mendenhall speech mr
clay says
now as an abstract principle there is no doubt of the truth of that declaration all men created equal
and it is desirable
in the original construction of society
to keep it in view as a great fundamental principle
again
in the same speech mr
clay says
if a state of nature existed and we were about to lay the foundations of society
no man would be more strongly opposed than i should to incorporate the institution of slavery among its elements
exactly so
in our new free territories
a state of nature does exist
in them congress lays the foundations of society and in laying those foundations
i say
with mr
it is desirable that the declaration of the equality of all men shall be kept in view as a great fundamental principle
and that congress
which lays the foundations of society
like mr
be strongly opposed to the incorporation of slavery and its elements
but it does not follow that social and political equality between whites and blacks must be incorporated because slavery must not
the declaration does not so require

legislation and adjudication must follow and conform to the progress of society
the progress of society now begins to produce cases of the transfer for debts of the entire property of railroad corporations and to enable transferees to use and enjoy the transferred property
legislation and adjudication begin to be necessary
shall this class of legislation just now beginning with us be general or special
section ten of our constitution requires that it should be general
if possible
read the section
special legislation always trenches upon the judicial department and in so far violates section two of the constitution
read it
just reasoning policy is in favor of general legislation else the legislature will be loaded down with the investigation of smaller cases a work which the courts ought to perform
and can perform much more perfectly
how can the legislature rightly decide the facts between p
b
and s
it is said that under a general law
whenever a r
gets tired of its debts
it may transfer fraudulently to get rid of them
so they may so may individuals and which the legislature or the courts is best suited to try the question of fraud in either case
it is said
if a purchaser have acquired legal rights
let him not be robbed of them
but if he needs legislation let him submit to just terms to obtain it
let him
say we
have general law in advance guarded in every possible way against fraud
so that
when he acquires a legal right
he will have no occasion to wait for additional legislation and if he has practiced fraud let the courts so decide
a legal opinion by abraham lincoln
the 11th section of the act of congress
approved feb
prescribing rules for the subdivision of sections of land within the united states system of surveys
standing unrepealed
in my opinion
is binding on the respective purchasers of different parts of the same section
and furnishes the true rule for surveyors in establishing lines between them
that law
being in force at the time each became a purchaser
becomes a condition of the purchase
by that law
i think the true rule for dividing into quarters any interior section or sections
which is not fractional
is to run straight lines through the section from the opposite quarter section corners
fixing the point where such straight lines cross
or intersect each other
as the middle or centre of the section
perhaps quite
all the original surveys are to some extent erroneous
and in some of the sections
greatly so
in each of the latter
it is obvious that a more equitable mode of division than the above might be adopted but as error is infinitely various perhaps no better single rules can be prescribed
at all events i think the above has been prescribed by the competent authority

your kind note inviting me to attend a festival in boston
on the 28th instant
in honor of the birthday of thomas jefferson
was duly received
my engagements are such that i cannot attend
bearing in mind that about seventy years ago two great political parties were first formed in this country
that thomas jefferson was the head of one of them and boston the headquarters of the other
it is both curious and interesting that those supposed to descend politically from the party opposed to jefferson should now be celebrating his birthday in their own original seat of empire
while those claiming political descent from him have nearly ceased to breathe his name everywhere
that the jefferson party was formed upon its supposed superior devotion to the personal rights of men
holding the rights of property to be secondary only
and greatly inferior
and assuming that the so called democracy of to day are the jefferson
and their opponents the anti jefferson
it will be equally interesting to note how completely the two have changed hands as to the principle upon which they were originally supposed to be divided
the democracy of to day hold the liberty of one man to be absolutely nothing
when in conflict with another man's right of property republicans
on the contrary
are for both the man and the dollar
but in case of conflict the man before the dollar
i remember being once much amused at seeing two partially intoxicated men engaged in a fight with their great coats on
which fight
after a long and rather harmless contest
ended in each having fought himself out of his own coat and into that of the other
if the two leading parties of this day are really identical with the two in the days of jefferson and adams
they have performed the same feat as the two drunken men
but soberly
it is now no child's play to save the principles of jefferson from total overthrow in this nation
one would state with great confidence that he could convince any sane child that the simpler propositions of euclid are true but nevertheless he would fail
with one who should deny the definitions and axioms
the principles of jefferson are the definitions and axioms of free society
and yet they are denied and evaded
with no small show of success
one dashingly calls them glittering generalities
another bluntly calls them self evident lies
and others insidiously argue that they apply to superior races
these expressions
differing in form
are identical in object and effect the supplanting the principles of free government
and restoring those of classification
and legitimacy
they would delight a convocation of crowned heads plotting against the people
they are the vanguard
the miners and sappers
of returning despotism
we must repulse them
or they will subjugate us
this is a world of compensation and he who would be no slave must consent to have no slave
those who deny freedom to others deserve it not for themselves
under a just god
cannot long retain it
all honor to jefferson to the man who
in the concrete pressure of a struggle for national independence by a single people
had the coolness
and capacity to introduce into a mere revolutionary document an abstract truth
applicable to all men and all times
and so to embalm it there that to day and in all coming days it shall be a rebuke and a stumbling block to the very harbingers of reappearing tyranny and oppression

theodore canisius
dear sir
your note asking
in behalf of yourself and other german citizens
whether i am for or against the constitutional provision in regard to naturalized citizens
lately adopted by massachusetts
and whether i am for or against a fusion of the republicans and other opposition elements for the canvass of 1860
is received
massachusetts is a sovereign and independent state and it is no privilege of mine to scold her for what she does
if from what she has done an inference is sought to be drawn as to what i would do
i may without impropriety speak out
i say
as i understand the massachusetts provision
i am against its adoption in illinois
or in any other place where i have a right to oppose it
understanding the spirit of our institutions to aim at the elevation of men
i am opposed to whatever tends to degrade them
i have some little notoriety for commiserating the oppressed negro and i should be strangely inconsistent if i could favor any project for curtailing the existing rights of white men
even though born in different lands
and speaking different languages from myself
as to the matter of fusion
i am for it if it can be had on republican grounds and i am not for it on any other terms
a fusion on any other terms would be as foolish as unprincipled
it would lose the whole north
while the common enemy would still carry the whole south
the question of men is a different one
there are good
patriotic men and able statesmen in the south whom i would cheerfully support
if they would now place themselves on republican ground
but i am against letting down the republican standard a hairsbreadth
i have written this hastily
but i believe it answers your questions substantially
yours truly
to the governor
and treasurer of the state of illinois
in reply to your inquiry requesting our written opinion as to what your duty requires you to do in executing the latter clause of the seventh section of an act in relation to the payment of the principal and interest of the state debt
approved feb'y 22
we reply that said last clause of said section is certainly indefinite
and ambiguous in its description of the bonds to be issued by you giving no time at which the bonds are to be made payable
no place at which either principal or interest are to be paid
and no rate of interest which the bonds are to bear nor any other description except that they are to be coupon bonds
which in commercial usage means interest paying bonds with obligations or orders attached to them for the payment of annual or semiannual interest there is we suppose no difficulty in ascertaining
if this act stood alone
what ought to be the construction of the terms coupon bonds and that it
would mean bonds bearing interest from the time of issuing the same
and under this act considered by itself the creditors would have a right to require such bonds
but your inquiry in regard to a class of bonds on which no interest is to be paid or shall begin to run until january 1
is whether the act of february 18
would not authorize you to refuse to give bonds with any coupons attached payable before the first day of july
we have very maturely considered this question and have arrived at the conclusion that you have a right to use such measures as will secure the state against the loss of six months' interest on these bonds by the indefiniteness of the act of 1859
while it cannot be denied that the letter of the laws favor the construction claimed by some of the creditors that interest bearing bonds were required to be issued to them
inasmuch as the restriction that no interest is to run on said bonds until 1st january
relates solely to the bonds issued under the act of 1857
and the act of 1859 directing you to issue new bonds does not contain this restriction
but directs you to issue coupon bonds
nevertheless the very indefiniteness and generality of the act of 1859
giving no rate of interest
no time due
no place of payment
no postponement of the time when interest commences
necessarily implies that the legislature intended to invest you with a discretion to impose such terms and restrictions as would protect the interest of the state and we think you have a right and that it is your duty to see that the state bonds are so issued that the state shall not lose six months' interest
two plans present themselves either of which will secure the state
if in literal compliance with the law you issue bonds bearing interest from 1st july
you may deduct from the bonds presented three thousand from every 100
000 of bonds and issue 97
000 of coupon bonds by this plan 3000 out of 100
000 of principal would be extinguished in consideration of paying 2910 interest on the first of january
1860 and the interest on the 3000 would forever cease this would be no doubt most advantageous to the state
but if the auditor will not consent to this
cut off of each bond all the coupons payable before 1st july
one of these plans would undoubtedly have been prescribed by the legislature if its attention had been directed to this question

july 28
samuel galloway
my dear sir
your very complimentary
not to say flattering
letter of the 23d inst
is received
reynolds had induced me to expect you here and i was disappointed not a little by your failure to come
and yet i fear you have formed an estimate of me which can scarcely be sustained on a personal acquaintance
two things done by the ohio republican convention the repudiation of judge swan
and the plank for a repeal of the fugitive slave law i very much regretted
these two things are of a piece and they are viewed by many good men
sincerely opposed to slavery
as a struggle against
and in disregard of
the constitution itself
and it is the very thing that will greatly endanger our cause
if it be not kept out of our national convention
there is another thing our friends are doing which gives me some uneasiness
it is their leaning toward popular sovereignty
there are three substantial objections to this
no party can command respect which sustains this year what it opposed last
douglas who is the most dangerous enemy of liberty
because the most insidious one would have little support in the north
and by consequence
no capital to trade on in the south
if it were not for his friends thus magnifying him and his humbug
but lastly
and chiefly
douglas's popular sovereignty
accepted by the public mind as a just principle
nationalizes slavery
and revives the african slave trade inevitably
taking slaves into new territories
and buying slaves in africa
are identical things
identical rights or identical wrongs
and the argument which establishes one will establish the other
try a thousand years for a sound reason why congress shall not hinder the people of kansas from having slaves
when you have found it
it will be an equally good one why congress should not hinder the people of georgia from importing slaves from africa
as to governor chase
i have a kind side for him
he was one of the few distinguished men of the nation who gave us
in illinois
their sympathy last year
i never saw him
but suppose him to be able and right minded but still he may not be the most suitable as a candidate for the presidency
i must say i do not think myself fit for the presidency
as you propose a correspondence with me
i shall look for your letters anxiously
i have not met dr
reynolds since receiving your letter but when i shall
i will present your respects as requested
yours very truly
it is bad to be poor
to hawkins taylor springfield
hawkins taylor
dear sir
yours of the 3d is just received
there is some mistake about my expected attendance of the u
court in your city on the 3d tuesday of this month
i have had no thought of being there
it is bad to be poor
i shall go to the wall for bread and meat if i neglect my business this year as well as last
it would please me much to see the city and good people of keokuk
but for this year it is little less than an impossibility
i am constantly receiving invitations which i am compelled to decline
i was pressingly urged to go to minnesota and i now have two invitations to go to ohio
these last are prompted by douglas going there and i am really tempted to make a flying trip to columbus and cincinnati
i do hope you will have no serious trouble in iowa
what thinks grimes about it
i have not known him to be mistaken about an election in iowa
present my respects to col
and any other friends
and believe me yours truly
speech at columbus
september 16
fellow citizens of the state of ohio
i cannot fail to remember that i appear for the first time before an audience in this now great state
an audience that is accustomed to hear such speakers as corwin
and chase
and wade
and many other renowned men and
remembering this
i feel that it will be well for you
as for me
that you should not raise your expectations to that standard to which you would have been justified in raising them had one of these distinguished men appeared before you
you would perhaps be only preparing a disappointment for yourselves
as a consequence of your disappointment
mortification to me
i hope
that you will commence with very moderate expectations and perhaps
if you will give me your attention
i shall be able to interest you to a moderate degree
appearing here for the first time in my life
i have been somewhat embarrassed for a topic by way of introduction to my speech but i have been relieved from that embarrassment by an introduction which the ohio statesman newspaper gave me this morning
in this paper i have read an article
in which
among other statements
i find the following
in debating with senator douglas during the memorable contest of last fall
lincoln declared in favor of negro suffrage
and attempted to defend that vile conception against the little giant
i mention this now
at the opening of my remarks
for the purpose of making three comments upon it
the first i have already announced
it furnishes me an introductory topic the second is to show that the gentleman is mistaken thirdly
to give him an opportunity to correct it
in the first place
in regard to this matter being a mistake
i have found that it is not entirely safe
when one is misrepresented under his very nose
to allow the misrepresentation to go uncontradicted
i therefore propose
here at the outset
not only to say that this is a misrepresentation
but to show conclusively that it is so and you will bear with me while i read a couple of extracts from that very memorable debate with judge douglas last year
to which this newspaper refers
in the first pitched battle which senator douglas and myself had
at the town of ottawa
i used the language which i will now read
having been previously reading an extract
i continued as follows
i don't want to read at any greater length
but this is the true complexion of all i have ever said in regard to the institution of slavery and the black race
this is the whole of it and anything that argues me into his idea of perfect social and political equality with the negro
is but a specious and fantastic arrangement of words
by which a man can prove a horse chestnut to be a chestnut horse
i will say here
while upon this subject
that i have no purpose directly or indirectly to interfere with the institution of slavery in the states where it exists
i believe i have no lawful right to do so
and i have no inclination to do so
i have no purpose to introduce political and social equality between the white and the black races
there is a physical difference between the two which
in my judgment
will probably forbid their ever living together upon the footing of perfect equality and inasmuch as it becomes a necessity that there must be a difference
as well as judge douglas
am in favor of the race to which i belong having the superior position
i have never said anything to the contrary
but i hold that
notwithstanding all this
there is no reason in the world why the negro is not entitled to all the natural rights enumerated in the declaration of independence
the right to life
liberty and the pursuit of happiness
i hold that he is as much entitled to these as the white man
i agree with judge douglas
he is not my equal in many respects
certainly not in color
perhaps not in moral or intellectual endowments
but in the right to eat the bread
without leave of anybody else
which his own hand earns
he is my equal
and the equal of judge douglas
and the equal of every living man
upon a subsequent occasion
when the reason for making a statement like this occurred
i said
while i was at the hotel to day an elderly gentleman called upon me to know whether i was really in favor of producing perfect equality between the negroes and white people
while i had not proposed to myself on this occasion to say much on that subject
as the question was asked me
i thought i would occupy perhaps five minutes in saying something in regard to it
i will say
that i am not
nor ever have been
in favor of bringing about in any way the social and political equality of the white and black races that i am not
nor ever have been
in favor of making voters or jurors of negroes
nor of qualifying them to hold office
or intermarry with the white people and i will say in addition to this that there is a physical difference between the white and black races which i believe will forever forbid the two races living together on terms of social and political equality
and inasmuch as they can not so live
while they do remain together there must be the position of superior and inferior
and i
as much as any other man
am in favor of having the superior position assigned to the white race
i say upon this occasion i do not perceive that because the white man is to have the superior position
the negro should be denied everything
i do not understand that because i do not want a negro woman for a slave
i must necessarily want her for a wife
my understanding is that i can just let her alone
i am now in my fiftieth year
and i certainly never have had a black woman for either a slave or a wife
so it seems to me quite possible for us to get along without making either slaves or wives of negroes
i will add to this that i have never seen
to my knowledge
a man
or child
who was in favor of producing perfect equality
social and political
between negroes and white men
i recollect of but one distinguished instance that i ever heard of so frequently as to be satisfied of its correctness
and that is the case of judge douglas's old friend colonel richard m
i will also add to the remarks i have made for i am not going to enter at large upon this subject
that i have never had the least apprehension that i or my friends would marry negroes
if there was no law to keep them from it but as judge douglas and his friends seem to be in great apprehension that they might
if there were no law to keep them from it
i give him the most solemn pledge that i will to the very last stand by the law of the state which forbids the marrying of white people with negroes
there
my friends
you have briefly what i have
upon former occasions
said upon this subject to which this newspaper
to the extent of its ability
has drawn the public attention
in it you not only perceive
as a probability
that in that contest i did not at any time say i was in favor of negro suffrage
but the absolute proof that twice once substantially
and once expressly i declared against it
having shown you this
there remains but a word of comment upon that newspaper article
it is this
that i presume the editor of that paper is an honest and truth loving man
and that he will be greatly obliged to me for furnishing him thus early an opportunity to correct the misrepresentation he has made
before it has run so long that malicious people can call him a liar
the giant himself has been here recently
i have seen a brief report of his speech
if it were otherwise unpleasant to me to introduce the subject of the negro as a topic for discussion
i might be somewhat relieved by the fact that he dealt exclusively in that subject while he was here
i shall
without much hesitation or diffidence
enter upon this subject
the american people
on the first day of january
found the african slave trade prohibited by a law of congress
in a majority of the states of this union
they found african slavery
or any other sort of slavery
prohibited by state constitutions
they also found a law existing
supposed to be valid
by which slavery was excluded from almost all the territory the united states then owned
this was the condition of the country
with reference to the institution of slavery
on the first of january
a few days after that
a bill was introduced into congress
which ran through its regular course in the two branches of the national legislature
and finally passed into a law in the month of may
by which the act of congress prohibiting slavery from going into the territories of the united states was repealed
in connection with the law itself
in fact
in the terms of the law
the then existing prohibition was not only repealed
but there was a declaration of a purpose on the part of congress never thereafter to exercise any power that they might have
real or supposed
to prohibit the extension or spread of slavery
this was a very great change for the law thus repealed was of more than thirty years' standing
following rapidly upon the heels of this action of congress
a decision of the supreme court is made
by which it is declared that congress
if it desires to prohibit the spread of slavery into the territories
has no constitutional power to do so
not only so
but that decision lays down principles which
if pushed to their logical conclusion
i say pushed to their logical conclusion
would decide that the constitutions of free states
forbidding slavery
are themselves unconstitutional
mark me
i do not say the judges said this
and let no man say i affirm the judges used these words but i only say it is my opinion that what they did say
if pressed to its logical conclusion
will inevitably result thus
looking at these things
the republican party
as i understand its principles and policy
believes that there is great danger of the institution of slavery being spread out and extended until it is ultimately made alike lawful in all the states of this union so believing
to prevent that incidental and ultimate consummation is the original and chief purpose of the republican organization
i say chief purpose of the republican organization for it is certainly true that if the national house shall fall into the hands of the republicans
they will have to attend to all the other matters of national house keeping
as well as this
the chief and real purpose of the republican party is eminently conservative
it proposes nothing save and except to restore this government to its original tone in regard to this element of slavery
and there to maintain it
looking for no further change in reference to it than that which the original framers of the government themselves expected and looked forward to
the chief danger to this purpose of the republican party is not just now the revival of the african slave trade
or the passage of a congressional slave code
or the declaring of a second dred scott decision
making slavery lawful in all the states
these are not pressing us just now
they are not quite ready yet
the authors of these measures know that we are too strong for them but they will be upon us in due time
and we will be grappling with them hand to hand
if they are not now headed off
they are not now the chief danger to the purpose of the republican organization but the most imminent danger that now threatens that purpose is that insidious douglas popular sovereignty
this is the miner and sapper
while it does not propose to revive the african slave trade
nor to pass a slave code
nor to make a second dred scott decision
it is preparing us for the onslaught and charge of these ultimate enemies when they shall be ready to come on
and the word of command for them to advance shall be given
i say this douglas popular sovereignty for there is a broad distinction
as i now understand it
between that article and a genuine popular sovereignty
i believe there is a genuine popular sovereignty
i think a definition of genuine popular sovereignty
in the abstract
would be about this
that each man shall do precisely as he pleases with himself
and with all those things which exclusively concern him
applied to government
this principle would be
that a general government shall do all those things which pertain to it
and all the local governments shall do precisely as they please in respect to those matters which exclusively concern them
i understand that this government of the united states
under which we live
is based upon this principle and i am misunderstood if it is supposed that i have any war to make upon that principle
what is judge douglas's popular sovereignty
it is
as a principle
no other than that if one man chooses to make a slave of another man neither that other man nor anybody else has a right to object
applied in government
as he seeks to apply it
it is this
in a new territory into which a few people are beginning to enter for the purpose of making their homes
they choose to either exclude slavery from their limits or to establish it there
however one or the other may affect the persons to be enslaved
or the infinitely greater number of persons who are afterwards to inhabit that territory
or the other members of the families of communities
of which they are but an incipient member
or the general head of the family of states as parent of all
however their action may affect one or the other of these
there is no power or right to interfere
that is douglas's popular sovereignty applied
he has a good deal of trouble with popular sovereignty
his explanations explanatory of explanations explained are interminable
the most lengthy
as i suppose
the most maturely considered of this long series of explanations is his great essay in harper's magazine
i will not attempt to enter on any very thorough investigation of his argument as there made and presented
i will nevertheless occupy a good portion of your time here in drawing your attention to certain points in it
such of you as may have read this document will have perceived that the judge early in the document quotes from two persons as belonging to the republican party
without naming them
but who can readily be recognized as being governor seward of new york and myself
it is true that exactly fifteen months ago this day
i believe
i for the first time expressed a sentiment upon this subject
and in such a manner that it should get into print
that the public might see it beyond the circle of my hearers and my expression of it at that time is the quotation that judge douglas makes
he has not made the quotation with accuracy
but justice to him requires me to say that it is sufficiently accurate not to change the sense
the sense of that quotation condensed is this
that this slavery element is a durable element of discord among us
and that we shall probably not have perfect peace in this country with it until it either masters the free principle in our government
or is so far mastered by the free principle as for the public mind to rest in the belief that it is going to its end
this sentiment
which i now express in this way
at no great distance of time
perhaps in different language
and in connection with some collateral ideas
expressed by governor seward
judge douglas has been so much annoyed by the expression of that sentiment that he has constantly
i believe
in almost all his speeches since it was uttered
been referring to it
i find he alluded to it in his speech here
as well as in the copyright essay
i do not now enter upon this for the purpose of making an elaborate argument to show that we were right in the expression of that sentiment
in other words
i shall not stop to say all that might properly be said upon this point
but i only ask your attention to it for the purpose of making one or two points upon it
if you will read the copyright essay
you will discover that judge douglas himself says a controversy between the american colonies and the government of great britain began on the slavery question in 1699
and continued from that time until the revolution and
while he did not say so
we all know that it has continued with more or less violence ever since the revolution
then we need not appeal to history
to the declarations of the framers of the government
but we know from judge douglas himself that slavery began to be an element of discord among the white people of this country as far back as 1699
or one hundred and sixty years ago
or five generations of men
counting thirty years to a generation
it would seem to me that it might have occurred to judge douglas
or anybody who had turned his attention to these facts
that there was something in the nature of that thing
somewhat durable for mischief and discord
there is another point i desire to make in regard to this matter
before i leave it
from the adoption of the constitution down to 1820 is the precise period of our history when we had comparative peace upon this question
the precise period of time when we came nearer to having peace about it than any other time of that entire one hundred and sixty years in which he says it began
or of the eighty years of our own constitution
then it would be worth our while to stop and examine into the probable reason of our coming nearer to having peace then than at any other time
this was the precise period of time in which our fathers adopted
and during which they followed
a policy restricting the spread of slavery
and the whole union was acquiescing in it
the whole country looked forward to the ultimate extinction of the institution
it was when a policy had been adopted
and was prevailing
which led all just and right minded men to suppose that slavery was gradually coming to an end
and that they might be quiet about it
watching it as it expired
i think judge douglas might have perceived that too and whether he did or not
it is worth the attention of fair minded men
here and elsewhere
to consider whether that is not the truth of the case
if he had looked at these two facts
that this matter has been an element of discord for one hundred and sixty years among this people
and that the only comparative peace we have had about it was when that policy prevailed in this government which he now wars upon
he might then
have been brought to a more just appreciation of what i said fifteen months ago
that a house divided against itself cannot stand
i believe that this government cannot endure permanently
half slave and half free
i do not expect the house to fall
i do not expect the union to dissolve but i do expect it will cease to be divided
it will become all one thing
or all the other
either the opponents of slavery will arrest the further spread of it
and place it where the public mind will rest in the belief that it is in the course of ultimate extinction
or its advocates will push it forward until it shall become alike lawful in all the states
old as well as new
north as well as south
that was my sentiment at that time
in connection with it
i said
we are now far into the fifth year since a policy was inaugurated with the avowed object and confident promise of putting an end to slavery agitation
under the operation of the policy that agitation has not only not ceased
but has constantly augmented
i now say to you here that we are advanced still farther into the sixth year since that policy of judge douglas that popular sovereignty of his for quieting the slavery question was made the national policy
fifteen months more have been added since i uttered that sentiment and i call upon you and all other right minded men to say whether that fifteen months have belied or corroborated my words
while i am here upon this subject
i cannot but express gratitude that this true view of this element of discord among us as i believe it is is attracting more and more attention
i do not believe that governor seward uttered that sentiment because i had done so before
but because he reflected upon this subject and saw the truth of it
nor do i believe because governor seward or i uttered it that mr
hickman of pennsylvania
different language
since that time
has declared his belief in the utter antagonism which exists between the principles of liberty and slavery
you see we are multiplying
while i am speaking of hickman
let me say
i know but little about him
i have never seen him
and know scarcely anything about the man but i will say this much of him
of all the anti lecompton democracy that have been brought to my notice
he alone has the true
genuine ring of the metal
and now
without indorsing anything else he has said
i will ask this audience to give three cheers for hickman
the audience responded with three rousing cheers for hickman
another point in the copyright essay to which i would ask your attention is rather a feature to be extracted from the whole thing
than from any express declaration of it at any point
it is a general feature of that document
of all of judge douglas's discussions of this question
that the territories of the united states and the states of this union are exactly alike that there is no difference between them at all that the constitution applies to the territories precisely as it does to the states and that the united states government
under the constitution
may not do in a state what it may not do in a territory
and what it must do in a state it must do in a territory
is that a true view of the case
it is necessary for this squatter sovereignty
but is it true
let us consider
what does it depend upon
it depends altogether upon the proposition that the states must
without the interference of the general government
do all those things that pertain exclusively to themselves
that are local in their nature
that have no connection with the general government
after judge douglas has established this proposition
which nobody disputes or ever has disputed
he proceeds to assume
without proving it
that slavery is one of those little
trivial matters which are of just about as much consequence as the question would be to me whether my neighbor should raise horned cattle or plant tobacco that there is no moral question about it
but that it is altogether a matter of dollars and cents that when a new territory is opened for settlement
the first man who goes into it may plant there a thing which
like the canada thistle or some other of those pests of the soil
cannot be dug out by the millions of men who will come thereafter that it is one of those little things that is so trivial in its nature that it has nor effect upon anybody save the few men who first plant upon the soil that it is not a thing which in any way affects the family of communities composing these states
nor any way endangers the general government
judge douglas ignores altogether the very well known fact that we have never had a serious menace to our political existence
except it sprang from this thing
which he chooses to regard as only upon a par with onions and potatoes
turn it
and contemplate it in another view
he says that
according to his popular sovereignty
the general government may give to the territories governors
and all the other chief men to govern them
but they
must not touch upon this other question
the question of who shall be governor of a territory for a year or two
and pass away
without his track being left upon the soil
or an act which he did for good or for evil being left behind
is a question of vast national magnitude it is so much opposed in its nature to locality that the nation itself must decide it
while this other matter of planting slavery upon a soil
a thing which
once planted
cannot be eradicated by the succeeding millions who have as much right there as the first comers
if eradicated
not without infinite difficulty and a long struggle
he considers the power to prohibit it as one of these little local
trivial things that the nation ought not to say a word about that it affects nobody save the few men who are there
take these two things and consider them together
present the question of planting a state with the institution of slavery by the side of a question who shall be governor of kansas for a year or two
and is there a man here
is there a man on earth
who would not say the governor question is the little one
and the slavery question is the great one
i ask any honest democrat if the small
the local
and the trivial and temporary question is not
who shall be governor
while the durable
the important
and the mischievous one is
shall this soil be planted with slavery
this is an idea
i suppose
which has arisen in judge douglas's mind from his peculiar structure
i suppose the institution of slavery really looks small to him
he is so put up by nature that a lash upon his back would hurt him
but a lash upon anybody else's back does not hurt him
that is the build of the man
and consequently he looks upon the matter of slavery in this unimportant light
judge douglas ought to remember
when he is endeavoring to force this policy upon the american people
that while he is put up in that way
a good many are not
he ought to remember that there was once in this country a man by the name of thomas jefferson
supposed to be a democrat
a man whose principles and policy are not very prevalent amongst democrats to day
it is true but that man did not take exactly this view of the insignificance of the element of slavery which our friend judge douglas does
in contemplation of this thing
we all know he was led to exclaim
i tremble for my country when i remember that god is just
we know how he looked upon it when he thus expressed himself
there was danger to this country
danger of the avenging justice of god
in that little unimportant popular sovereignty question of judge douglas
he supposed there was a question of god's eternal justice wrapped up in the enslaving of any race of men
or any man
and that those who did so braved the arm of jehovah that when a nation thus dared the almighty
every friend of that nation had cause to dread his wrath
choose ye between jefferson and douglas as to what is the true view of this element among us
there is another little difficulty about this matter of treating the territories and states alike in all things
to which i ask your attention
and i shall leave this branch of the case
if there is no difference between them
why not make the territories states at once
what is the reason that kansas was not fit to come into the union when it was organized into a territory
in judge douglas's view
can any of you tell any reason why it should not have come into the union at once
they are fit
as he thinks
to decide upon the slavery question
the largest and most important with which they could possibly deal
what could they do by coming into the union that they are not fit to do
according to his view
by staying out of it
they are not fit to sit in congress and decide upon the rates of postage
or questions of ad valorem or specific duties on foreign goods
or live oak timber contracts
they are not fit to decide these vastly important matters
which are national in their import
but they are fit
from the jump
to decide this little negro question
the case is too plain i occupy too much time on this head
and i pass on
near the close of the copyright essay
the judge
i think
comes very near kicking his own fat into the fire
i did not think
when i commenced these remarks
that i would read that article
but i now believe i will
this exposition of the history of these measures shows conclusively that the authors of the compromise measures of 1850 and of the kansas nebraska act of 1854
as well as the members of the continental congress of 1774
and the founders of our system of government subsequent to the revolution
regarded the people of the territories and colonies as political communities which were entitled to a free and exclusive power of legislation in their provisional legislatures
where their representation could alone be preserved
in all cases of taxation and internal polity
when the judge saw that putting in the word slavery would contradict his own history
he put in what he knew would pass synonymous with it
internal polity
whenever we find that in one of his speeches
the substitute is used in this manner and i can tell you the reason
it would be too bald a contradiction to say slavery but internal polity is a general phrase
which would pass in some quarters
and which he hopes will pass with the reading community for the same thing
this right pertains to the people collectively
as a law abiding and peaceful community
and not in the isolated individuals who may wander upon the public domain in violation of the law
it can only be exercised where there are inhabitants sufficient to constitute a government
and capable of performing its various functions and duties
a fact to be ascertained and determined by who do you think
judge douglas says by congress
whether the number shall be fixed at ten
fifteen or twenty thousand inhabitants
does not affect the principle
now
i have only a few comments to make
popular sovereignty
by his own words
does not pertain to the few persons who wander upon the public domain in violation of law
we have his words for that
when it does pertain to them
is when they are sufficient to be formed into an organized political community
and he fixes the minimum for that at ten thousand
and the maximum at twenty thousand
i would like to know what is to be done with the nine thousand
are they all to be treated
until they are large enough to be organized into a political community
as wanderers upon the public land
in violation of law
and if so treated and driven out
at what point of time would there ever be ten thousand
if they were not driven out
but remained there as trespassers upon the public land in violation of the law
can they establish slavery there
no the judge says popular sovereignty don't pertain to them then
can they exclude it then
no popular sovereignty don't pertain to them then
i would like to know
in the case covered by the essay
what condition the people of the territory are in before they reach the number of ten thousand
but the main point i wish to ask attention to is
that the question as to when they shall have reached a sufficient number to be formed into a regular organized community is to be decided by congress
judge douglas says so
that is about all we want
that is all the southerners want
that is what all those who are for slavery want
they do not want congress to prohibit slavery from coming into the new territories
and they do not want popular sovereignty to hinder it and as congress is to say when they are ready to be organized
all that the south has to do is to get congress to hold off
let congress hold off until they are ready to be admitted as a state
and the south has all it wants in taking slavery into and planting it in all the territories that we now have or hereafter may have
in a word
the whole thing
at a dash of the pen
is at last put in the power of congress for if they do not have this popular sovereignty until congress organizes them
i ask if it at last does not come from congress
at last
it amounts to anything at all
congress gives it to them
i submit this rather for your reflection than for comment
after all that is said
at last
by a dash of the pen
everything that has gone before is undone
and he puts the whole question under the control of congress
after fighting through more than three hours
if you undertake to read it
he at last places the whole matter under the control of that power which he has been contending against
and arrives at a result directly contrary to what he had been laboring to do
he at last leaves the whole matter to the control of congress
there are two main objects
as i understand it
of this harper's magazine essay
one was to show
if possible
that the men of our revolutionary times were in favor of his popular sovereignty
and the other was to show that the dred scott decision had not entirely squelched out this popular sovereignty
i do not propose
in regard to this argument drawn from the history of former times
to enter into a detailed examination of the historical statements he has made
i have the impression that they are inaccurate in a great many instances
sometimes in positive statement
but very much more inaccurate by the suppression of statements that really belong to the history
but i do not propose to affirm that this is so to any very great extent
or to enter into a very minute examination of his historical statements
i avoid doing so upon this principle
that if it were important for me to pass out of this lot in the least period of time possible
and i came to that fence
and saw by a calculation of my known strength and agility that i could clear it at a bound
it would be folly for me to stop and consider whether i could or not crawl through a crack
so i say of the whole history contained in his essay where he endeavored to link the men of the revolution to popular sovereignty
it only requires an effort to leap out of it
a single bound to be entirely successful
if you read it over
you will find that he quotes here and there from documents of the revolutionary times
tending to show that the people of the colonies were desirous of regulating their own concerns in their own way
that the british government should not interfere that at one time they struggled with the british government to be permitted to exclude the african slave trade
if not directly
to be permitted to exclude it indirectly
by taxation sufficient to discourage and destroy it
from these and many things of this sort
judge douglas argues that they were in favor of the people of our own territories excluding slavery if they wanted to
or planting it there if they wanted to
doing just as they pleased from the time they settled upon the territory
however his history may apply and whatever of his argument there may be that is sound and accurate or unsound and inaccurate
if we can find out what these men did themselves do upon this very question of slavery in the territories
does it not end the whole thing
after all this labor and effort to show that the men of the revolution were in favor of his popular sovereignty and his mode of dealing with slavery in the territories
we can show that these very men took hold of that subject
and dealt with it
we can see for ourselves how they dealt with it
it is not a matter of argument or inference
but we know what they thought about it
it is precisely upon that part of the history of the country that one important omission is made by judge douglas
he selects parts of the history of the united states upon the subject of slavery
and treats it as the whole
omitting from his historical sketch the legislation of congress in regard to the admission of missouri
by which the missouri compromise was established and slavery excluded from a country half as large as the present united states
all this is left out of his history
and in nowise alluded to by him
so far as i can remember
save once
when he makes a remark
that upon his principle the supreme court were authorized to pronounce a decision that the act called the missouri compromise was unconstitutional
all that history has been left out
but this part of the history of the country was not made by the men of the revolution
there was another part of our political history
made by the very men who were the actors in the revolution
which has taken the name of the ordinance of '87
let me bring that history to your attention
in 1784
i believe
this same mr
jefferson drew up an ordinance for the government of the country upon which we now stand
a frame or draft of an ordinance for the government of this country
here in ohio
our neighbors in indiana
us who live in illinois
our neighbors in wisconsin and michigan
in that ordinance
drawn up not only for the government of that territory
but for the territories south of the ohio river
jefferson expressly provided for the prohibition of slavery
judge douglas says
and perhaps is right
that that provision was lost from that ordinance
i believe that is true
when the vote was taken upon it
a majority of all present in the congress of the confederation voted for it but there were so many absentees that those voting for it did not make the clear majority necessary
and it was lost
but three years after that
the congress of the confederation were together again
and they adopted a new ordinance for the government of this northwest territory
not contemplating territory south of the river
for the states owning that territory had hitherto refrained from giving it to the general government hence they made the ordinance to apply only to what the government owned
in fact
the provision excluding slavery was inserted aside
passed unanimously
or at any rate it passed and became a part of the law of the land
under that ordinance we live
first here in ohio you were a territory then an enabling act was passed
authorizing you to form a constitution and state government
provided it was republican and not in conflict with the ordinance of '87
when you framed your constitution and presented it for admission
i think you will find the legislation upon the subject will show that
whereas you had formed a constitution that was republican
and not in conflict with the ordinance of '87
therefore you were admitted upon equal footing with the original states
the same process in a few years was gone through with in indiana
and so with illinois
and the same substantially with michigan and wisconsin
not only did that ordinance prevail
but it was constantly looked to whenever a step was taken by a new territory to become a state
congress always turned their attention to it
and in all their movements upon this subject they traced their course by that ordinance of '87
when they admitted new states
they advertised them of this ordinance
as a part of the legislation of the country
they did so because they had traced the ordinance of '87 throughout the history of this country
begin with the men of the revolution
and go down for sixty entire years
and until the last scrap of that territory comes into the union in the form of the state of wisconsin
everything was made to conform with the ordinance of '87
excluding slavery from that vast extent of country
i omitted to mention in the right place that the constitution of the united states was in process of being framed when that ordinance was made by the congress of the confederation and one of the first acts of congress itself
under the new constitution itself
was to give force to that ordinance by putting power to carry it out in the hands of the new officers under the constitution
in the place of the old ones
who had been legislated out of existence by the change in the government from the confederation to the constitution
not only so
but i believe indiana once or twice
if not ohio
petitioned the general government for the privilege of suspending that provision and allowing them to have slaves
a report made by mr
of virginia
himself a slaveholder
was directly against it
and the action was to refuse them the privilege of violating the ordinance of '87
this period of history
which i have run over briefly
i presume
as familiar to most of this assembly as any other part of the history of our country
i suppose that few of my hearers are not as familiar with that part of history as i am
and i only mention it to recall your attention to it at this time
and hence i ask how extraordinary a thing it is that a man who has occupied a position upon the floor of the senate of the united states
who is now in his third term
and who looks to see the government of this whole country fall into his own hands
pretending to give a truthful and accurate history o the slavery question in this country
should so entirely ignore the whole of that portion of our history the most important of all
is it not a most extraordinary spectacle that a man should stand up and ask for any confidence in his statements who sets out as he does with portions of history
calling upon the people to believe that it is a true and fair representation
when the leading part and controlling feature of the whole history is carefully suppressed
but the mere leaving out is not the most remarkable feature of this most remarkable essay
his proposition is to establish that the leading men of the revolution were for his great principle of nonintervention by the government in the question of slavery in the territories
while history shows that they decided
in the cases actually brought before them
in exactly the contrary way
and he knows it
not only did they so decide at that time
but they stuck to it during sixty years
through thick and thin
as long as there was one of the revolutionary heroes upon the stage of political action
through their whole course
from first to last
they clung to freedom
and now he asks the community to believe that the men of the revolution were in favor of his great principle
when we have the naked history that they themselves dealt with this very subject matter of his principle
and utterly repudiated his principle
acting upon a precisely contrary ground
it is as impudent and absurd as if a prosecuting attorney should stand up before a jury and ask them to convict a as the murderer of b
while b was walking alive before them
i say
if judge douglas asserts that the men of the revolution acted upon principles by which
to be consistent with themselves
they ought to have adopted his popular sovereignty
upon a consideration of his own argument
he had a right to make you believe that they understood the principles of government
but misapplied them
that he has arisen to enlighten the world as to the just application of this principle
he has a right to try to persuade you that he understands their principles better than they did
he will apply them now
not as they did
but as they ought to have done
he has a right to go before the community and try to convince them of this
but he has no right to attempt to impose upon any one the belief that these men themselves approved of his great principle
there are two ways of establishing a proposition
one is by trying to demonstrate it upon reason
and the other is
to show that great men in former times have thought so and so
and thus to pass it by the weight of pure authority
if judge douglas will demonstrate somehow that this is popular sovereignty
the right of one man to make a slave of another
without any right in that other or any one else to object
demonstrate it as euclid demonstrated propositions
there is no objection
but when he comes forward
seeking to carry a principle by bringing to it the authority of men who themselves utterly repudiate that principle
i ask that he shall not be permitted to do it
i see
in the judge's speech here
a short sentence in these words
our fathers
when they formed this government under which we live
understood this question just as well
and even better than
we do now
that is true i stick to that
i will stand by judge douglas in that to the bitter end
and now
judge douglas
come and stand by me
and truthfully show how they acted
understanding it better than we do
all i ask of you
judge douglas
is to stick to the proposition that the men of the revolution understood this subject better than we do now
and with that better understanding they acted better than you are trying to act now
i wish to say something now in regard to the dred scott decision
as dealt with by judge douglas
in that memorable debate between judge douglas and myself
last year
the judge thought fit to commence a process of catechising me
and at freeport i answered his questions
and propounded some to him
among others propounded to him was one that i have here now
the substance
as i remember it
can the people of a united states territory
under the dred scott decision
in any lawful way
against the wish of any citizen of the united states
exclude slavery from its limits
prior to the formation of a state constitution
he answered that they could lawfully exclude slavery from the united states territories
notwithstanding the dred scot decision
there was something about that answer that has probably been a trouble to the judge ever since
the dred scott decision expressly gives every citizen of the united states a right to carry his slaves into the united states territories
and now there was some inconsistency in saying that the decision was right
and saying
that the people of the territory could lawfully drive slavery out again
when all the trash
the words
the collateral matter
was cleared away from it
all the chaff was fanned out of it
it was a bare absurdity
no less than that a thing may be lawfully driven away from where it has a lawful right to be
clear it of all the verbiage
and that is the naked truth of his proposition
that a thing may be lawfully driven from the place where it has a lawful right to stay
it was because the judge could n't help seeing this that he has had so much trouble with it and what i want to ask your especial attention to
just now
is to remind you
if you have not noticed the fact
that the judge does not any longer say that the people can exclude slavery
he does not say so in the copyright essay he did not say so in the speech that he made here and
so far as i know
since his re election to the senate he has never said
as he did at freeport
that the people of the territories can exclude slavery
he desires that you
who wish the territories to remain free
should believe that he stands by that position but he does not say it himself
he escapes to some extent the absurd position i have stated
by changing his language entirely
what he says now is something different in language
and we will consider whether it is not different in sense too
it is now that the dred scott decision
or rather the constitution under that decision
does not carry slavery into the territories beyond the power of the people of the territories to control it as other property
he does not say the people can drive it out
but they can control it as other property
the language is different we should consider whether the sense is different
driving a horse out of this lot is too plain a proposition to be mistaken about it is putting him on the other side of the fence
or it might be a sort of exclusion of him from the lot if you were to kill him and let the worms devour him but neither of these things is the same as controlling him as other property
that would be to feed him
to pamper him
to ride him
to use and abuse him
to make the most money out of him
as other property but
please you
what do the men who are in favor of slavery want more than this
what do they really want
other than that slavery
being in the territories
shall be controlled as other property
if they want anything else
i do not comprehend it
i ask your attention to this
for the purpose of pointing out the change of ground the judge has made and
in the second place
the importance of the change
that that change is not such as to give you gentlemen who want his popular sovereignty the power to exclude the institution or drive it out at all
i know the judge sometimes squints at the argument that in controlling it as other property by unfriendly legislation they may control it to death as you might
in the case of a horse
feed him so lightly and ride him so much that he would die
but when you come to legislative control
there is something more to be attended to
i have no doubt
that if the territories should undertake to control slave property as other property that is
control it in such a way that it would be the most valuable as property
and make it bear its just proportion in the way of burdens as property
really deal with it as property
the supreme court of the united states will say
god speed you
and amen
but i undertake to give the opinion
at least
that if the territories attempt by any direct legislation to drive the man with his slave out of the territory
or to decide that his slave is free because of his being taken in there
or to tax him to such an extent that he cannot keep him there
the supreme court will unhesitatingly decide all such legislation unconstitutional
as long as that supreme court is constructed as the dred scott supreme court is
the first two things they have already decided
except that there is a little quibble among lawyers between the words dicta and decision
they have already decided a negro cannot be made free by territorial legislation
what is the dred scott decision
judge douglas labors to show that it is one thing
while i think it is altogether different
it is a long opinion
but it is all embodied in this short statement
the constitution of the united states forbids congress to deprive a man of his property
without due process of law the right of property in slaves is distinctly and expressly affirmed in that constitution
if congress shall undertake to say that a man's slave is no longer his slave when he crosses a certain line into a territory
that is depriving him of his property without due process of law
and is unconstitutional
there is the whole dred scott decision
they add that if congress cannot do so itself
congress cannot confer any power to do so and hence any effort by the territorial legislature to do either of these things is absolutely decided against
it is a foregone conclusion by that court
as to this indirect mode by unfriendly legislation
all lawyers here will readily understand that such a proposition cannot be tolerated for a moment
because a legislature cannot indirectly do that which it cannot accomplish directly
then i say any legislation to control this property
as property
for its benefit as property
would be hailed by this dred scott supreme court
and fully sustained but any legislation driving slave property out
or destroying it as property
directly or indirectly
will most assuredly
by that court
be held unconstitutional
judge douglas says if the constitution carries slavery into the territories
beyond the power of the people of the territories to control it as other property then it follows logically that every one who swears to support the constitution of the united states must give that support to that property which it needs
if the constitution carries slavery into the territories
beyond the power of the people
to control it as other property
then it also carries it into the states
because the constitution is the supreme law of the land
if it were not for my excessive modesty
i would say that i told that very thing to judge douglas quite a year ago
this argument is here in print
and if it were not for my modesty
as i said
i might call your attention to it
if you read it
you will find that i not only made that argument
but made it better than he has made it since
there is
this difference
i say now
and said then
there is no sort of question that the supreme court has decided that it is the right of the slave holder to take his slave and hold him in the territory and saying this
judge douglas himself admits the conclusion
he says if that is so
this consequence will follow and because this consequence would follow
his argument is
the decision cannot
be that way
that would spoil my popular sovereignty and it cannot be possible that this great principle has been squelched out in this extraordinary way
it might be
if it were not for the extraordinary consequences of spoiling my humbug
another feature of the judge's argument about the dred scott case is
an effort to show that that decision deals altogether in declarations of negatives that the constitution does not affirm anything as expounded by the dred scott decision
but it only declares a want of power a total absence of power
in reference to the territories
it seems to be his purpose to make the whole of that decision to result in a mere negative declaration of a want of power in congress to do anything in relation to this matter in the territories
i know the opinion of the judges states that there is a total absence of power but that is
unfortunately not all it states
for the judges add that the right of property in a slave is distinctly and expressly affirmed in the constitution
it does not stop at saying that the right of property in a slave is recognized in the constitution
is declared to exist somewhere in the constitution
but says it is affirmed in the constitution
its language is equivalent to saying that it is embodied and so woven in that instrument that it cannot be detached without breaking the constitution itself
in a word
it is part of the constitution
douglas is singularly unfortunate in his effort to make out that decision to be altogether negative
when the express language at the vital part is that this is distinctly affirmed in the constitution
i think myself
and i repeat it here
that this decision does not merely carry slavery into the territories
but by its logical conclusion it carries it into the states in which we live
one provision of that constitution is
that it shall be the supreme law of the land
i do not quote the language
any constitution or law of any state to the contrary notwithstanding
this dred scott decision says that the right of property in a slave is affirmed in that constitution which is the supreme law of the land
any state constitution or law notwithstanding
then i say that to destroy a thing which is distinctly affirmed and supported by the supreme law of the land
even by a state constitution or law
is a violation of that supreme law
and there is no escape from it
in my judgment there is no avoiding that result
save that the american people shall see that constitutions are better construed than our constitution is construed in that decision
they must take care that it is more faithfully and truly carried out than it is there expounded
i must hasten to a conclusion
near the beginning of my remarks i said that this insidious douglas popular sovereignty is the measure that now threatens the purpose of the republican party to prevent slavery from being nationalized in the united states
i propose to ask your attention for a little while to some propositions in affirmance of that statement
take it just as it stands
and apply it as a principle extend and apply that principle elsewhere and consider where it will lead you
i now put this proposition
that judge douglas's popular sovereignty applied will reopen the african slave trade and i will demonstrate it by any variety of ways in which you can turn the subject or look at it
the judge says that the people of the territories have the right
by his principle
to have slaves
if they want them
then i say that the people in georgia have the right to buy slaves in africa
if they want them and i defy any man on earth to show any distinction between the two things
to show that the one is either more wicked or more unlawful to show
on original principles
that one is better or worse than the other or to show
by the constitution
that one differs a whit from the other
he will tell me
that there is no constitutional provision against people taking slaves into the new territories
and i tell him that there is equally no constitutional provision against buying slaves in africa
he will tell you that a people
in the exercise of popular sovereignty
ought to do as they please about that thing
and have slaves if they want them and i tell you that the people of georgia are as much entitled to popular sovereignty and to buy slaves in africa
if they want them
as the people of the territory are to have slaves if they want them
i ask any man
dealing honestly with himself
to point out a distinction
i have recently seen a letter of judge douglas's in which
without stating that to be the object
he doubtless endeavors to make a distinction between the two
he says he is unalterably opposed to the repeal of the laws against the african slave trade
and why
he then seeks to give a reason that would not apply to his popular sovereignty in the territories
what is that reason
the abolition of the african slave trade is a compromise of the constitution
i deny it
there is no truth in the proposition that the abolition of the african slave trade is a compromise of the constitution
no man can put his finger on anything in the constitution
or on the line of history
which shows it
it is a mere barren assertion
made simply for the purpose of getting up a distinction between the revival of the african slave trade and his great principle
at the time the constitution of the united states was adopted
it was expected that the slave trade would be abolished
i should assert and insist upon that
if judge douglas denied it
but i know that it was equally expected that slavery would be excluded from the territories
and i can show by history that in regard to these two things public opinion was exactly alike
while in regard to positive action
there was more done in the ordinance of '87 to resist the spread of slavery than was ever done to abolish the foreign slave trade
lest i be misunderstood
i say again that at the time of the formation of the constitution
public expectation was that the slave trade would be abolished
but no more so than the spread of slavery in the territories should be restrained
they stand alike
except that in the ordinance of '87 there was a mark left by public opinion
showing that it was more committed against the spread of slavery in the territories than against the foreign slave trade
what word of compromise was there about it
the public sense was then in favor of the abolition of the slave trade but there was at the time a very great commercial interest involved in it
and extensive capital in that branch of trade
there were doubtless the incipient stages of improvement in the south in the way of farming
dependent on the slave trade
and they made a proposition to congress to abolish the trade after allowing it twenty years
a sufficient time for the capital and commerce engaged in it to be transferred to other channel
they made no provision that it should be abolished in twenty years i do not doubt that they expected it would be
but they made no bargain about it
the public sentiment left no doubt in the minds of any that it would be done away
i repeat
there is nothing in the history of those times in favor of that matter being a compromise of the constitution
it was the public expectation at the time
manifested in a thousand ways
that the spread of slavery should also be restricted
then i say
if this principle is established
that there is no wrong in slavery
and whoever wants it has a right to have it
is a matter of dollars and cents
a sort of question as to how they shall deal with brutes
that between us and the negro here there is no sort of question
but that at the south the question is between the negro and the crocodile
that is all
it is a mere matter of policy
there is a perfect right
according to interest
to do just as you please
when this is done
where this doctrine prevails
the miners and sappers will have formed public opinion for the slave trade
they will be ready for jeff
davis and stephens and other leaders of that company to sound the bugle for the revival of the slave trade
for the second dred scott decision
for the flood of slavery to be poured over the free states
while we shall be here tied down and helpless and run over like sheep
it is to be a part and parcel of this same idea to say to men who want to adhere to the democratic party
who have always belonged to that party
and are only looking about for some excuse to stick to it
but nevertheless hate slavery
that douglas's popular sovereignty is as good a way as any to oppose slavery
they allow themselves to be persuaded easily
in accordance with their previous dispositions
into this belief
that it is about as good a way of opposing slavery as any
and we can do that without straining our old party ties or breaking up old political associations
we can do so without being called negro worshipers
we can do that without being subjected to the jibes and sneers that are so readily thrown out in place of argument where no argument can be found
so let us stick to this popular sovereignty
this insidious popular sovereignty
now let me call your attention to one thing that has really happened
which shows this gradual and steady debauching of public opinion
this course of preparation for the revival of the slave trade
for the territorial slave code
and the new dred scott decision that is to carry slavery into the free states
did you ever
five years ago
hear of anybody in the world saying that the negro had no share in the declaration of national independence that it does not mean negroes at all and when all men were spoken of
negroes were not included
i am satisfied that five years ago that proposition was not put upon paper by any living being anywhere
i have been unable at any time to find a man in an audience who would declare that he had ever known of anybody saying so five years ago
but last year there was not a douglas popular sovereign in illinois who did not say it
is there one in ohio but declares his firm belief that the declaration of independence did not mean negroes at all
i do not know how this is i have not been here much but i presume you are very much alike everywhere
then i suppose that all now express the belief that the declaration of independence never did mean negroes
i call upon one of them to say that he said it five years ago
if you think that now
and did not think it then
the next thing that strikes me is to remark that there has been a change wrought in you
and a very significant change it is
being no less than changing the negro
in your estimation
from the rank of a man to that of a brute
they are taking him down and placing him
when spoken of
among reptiles and crocodiles
as judge douglas himself expresses it
is not this change wrought in your minds a very important change
public opinion in this country is everything
in a nation like ours
this popular sovereignty and squatter sovereignty have already wrought a change in the public mind to the extent i have stated
there is no man in this crowd who can contradict it
if you are opposed to slavery honestly
as much as anybody
i ask you to note that fact
and the like of which is to follow
to be plastered on
layer after layer
until very soon you are prepared to deal with the negro every where as with the brute
if public sentiment has not been debauched already to this point
a new turn of the screw in that direction is all that is wanting and this is constantly being done by the teachers of this insidious popular sovereignty
you need but one or two turns further
until your minds
now ripening under these teachings
will be ready for all these things
and you will receive and support
or submit to
the slave trade
revived with all its horrors
a slave code enforced in our territories
and a new dred scott decision to bring slavery up into the very heart of the free north
i must say
is but carrying out those words prophetically spoken by mr
many years ago
i believe more than thirty years
when he told an audience that if they would repress all tendencies to liberty and ultimate emancipation they must go back to the era of our independence
and muzzle the cannon which thundered its annual joyous return on the fourth of july they must blow out the moral lights around us they must penetrate the human soul
and eradicate the love of liberty
but until they did these things
and others eloquently enumerated by him
they could not repress all tendencies to ultimate emancipation
i ask attention to the fact that in a pre eminent degree these popular sovereigns are at this work
blowing out the moral lights around us teaching that the negro is no longer a man
but a brute that the declaration has nothing to do with him that he ranks with the crocodile and the reptile that man
with body and soul
is a matter of dollars and cents
i suggest to this portion of the ohio republicans
or democrats
if there be any present
the serious consideration of this fact that there is now going on among you a steady process of debauching public opinion on this subject
with this
my friends
i bid you adieu
speech at cincinnati ohio
september 17
1859 my fellow citizens of the state of ohio
this is the first time in my life that i have appeared before an audience in so great a city as this
i therefore though i am no longer a young man make this appearance under some degree of embarrassment
but i have found that when one is embarrassed
usually the shortest way to get through with it is to quit talking or thinking about it
and go at something else
i understand that you have had recently with you my very distinguished friend judge douglas
of illinois and i understand
without having had an opportunity not greatly sought
to be sure of seeing a report of the speech that he made here
that he did me the honor to mention my humble name
i suppose that he did so for the purpose of making some objection to some sentiment at some time expressed by me
i should expect
it is true
that judge douglas had reminded you
or informed you
if you had never before heard it
that i had once in my life declared it as my opinion that this government cannot endure permanently
half slave and half free that a house divided against itself cannot stand
as i had expressed it
i did not expect the house to fall
that i did not expect the union to be dissolved
but that i did expect that it would cease to be divided
that it would become all one thing
or all the other that either the opponents of slavery would arrest the further spread of it
and place it where the public mind would rest in the belief that it was in the course of ultimate extinction
or the friends of slavery will push it forward until it becomes alike lawful in all the states
old or new
free as well as slave
i did
fifteen months ago
express that opinion
and upon many occasions judge douglas has denounced it
and has greatly
intentionally or unintentionally
misrepresented my purpose in the expression of that opinion
i presume
without having seen a report of his speech
that he did so here
i presume that he alluded also to that opinion
in different language
having been expressed at a subsequent time by governor seward of new york
and that he took the two in a lump and denounced them that he tried to point out that there was something couched in this opinion which led to the making of an entire uniformity of the local institutions of the various states of the union
in utter disregard of the different states
which in their nature would seem to require a variety of institutions and a variety of laws
conforming to the differences in the nature of the different states
not only so
i presume he insisted that this was a declaration of war between the free and slave states
that it was the sounding to the onset of continual war between the different states
the slave and free states
this charge
in this form
was made by judge douglas on
i believe
the 9th of july
in chicago
in my hearing
on the next evening
i made some reply to it
i informed him that many of the inferences he drew from that expression of mine were altogether foreign to any purpose entertained by me
and in so far as he should ascribe these inferences to me
as my purpose
he was entirely mistaken and in so far as he might argue that
whatever might be my purpose
actions conforming to my views would lead to these results
he might argue and establish if he could but
so far as purposes were concerned
he was totally mistaken as to me
when i made that reply to him
i told him
on the question of declaring war between the different states of the union
that i had not said that i did not expect any peace upon this question until slavery was exterminated that i had only said i expected peace when that institution was put where the public mind should rest in the belief that it was in course of ultimate extinction that i believed
from the organization of our government until a very recent period of time
the institution had been placed and continued upon such a basis that we had had comparative peace upon that question through a portion of that period of time
only because the public mind rested in that belief in regard to it
and that when we returned to that position in relation to that matter
i supposed we should again have peace as we previously had
i assured him
as i now
assure you
that i neither then had
nor have
or ever had
any purpose in any way of interfering with the institution of slavery
where it exists
i believe we have no power
under the constitution of the united states
or rather under the form of government under which we live
to interfere with the institution of slavery
or any other of the institutions of our sister states
be they free or slave states
i declared then
and i now re declare
that i have as little inclination to interfere with the institution of slavery where it now exists
through the instrumentality of the general government
or any other instrumentality
as i believe we have no power to do so
i accidentally used this expression
i had no purpose of entering into the slave states to disturb the institution of slavery
upon the first occasion that judge douglas got an opportunity to reply to me
he passed by the whole body of what i had said upon that subject
and seized upon the particular expression of mine that i had no purpose of entering into the slave states to disturb the institution of slavery
said he
he lincoln won't enter into the slave states to disturb the institution of slavery
he is too prudent a man to do such a thing as that he only means that he will go on to the line between the free and slave states
and shoot over at them
this is all he means to do
he means to do them all the harm he can
to disturb them all he can
in such a way as to keep his own hide in perfect safety
well
i did not think
at that time
that that was either a very dignified or very logical argument but so it was
i had to get along with it as well as i could
it has occurred to me here to night that if i ever do shoot over the line at the people on the other side of the line into a slave state
and purpose to do so
keeping my skin safe
that i have now about the best chance i shall ever have
i should not wonder if there are some kentuckians about this audience we are close to kentucky and whether that be so or not
we are on elevated ground
by speaking distinctly
i should not wonder if some of the kentuckians would hear me on the other side of the river
for that reason i propose to address a portion of what i have to say to the kentuckians
i say
in the first place
to the kentuckians
that i am what they call
as i understand it
a black republican
i think slavery is wrong
morally and politically
i desire that it should be no further spread in these united states
and i should not object if it should gradually terminate in the whole union
while i say this for myself
i say to you kentuckians that i understand you differ radically with me upon this proposition that you believe slavery is a good thing that slavery is right that it ought to be extended and perpetuated in this union
there being this broad difference between us
i do not pretend
in addressing myself to you kentuckians
to attempt proselyting you that would be a vain effort
i do not enter upon it
i only propose to try to show you that you ought to nominate for the next presidency
at charleston
my distinguished friend judge douglas
in all that there is a difference between you and him
i understand he is sincerely for you
and more wisely for you than you are for yourselves
i will try to demonstrate that proposition
i say that i believe he is as sincerely for you
and more wisely for you
than you are for yourselves
what do you want more than anything else to make successful your views of slavery
to advance the outspread of it
and to secure and perpetuate the nationality of it
what do you want more than anything else
what is needed absolutely
what is indispensable to you
if i may
be allowed to answer the question
it is to retain a hold upon the north
it is to retain support and strength from the free states
if you can get this support and strength from the free states
you can succeed
if you do not get this support and this strength from the free states
you are in the minority
and you are beaten at once
if that proposition be admitted
and it is undeniable
then the next thing i say to you is
that douglas
of all the men in this nation
is the only man that affords you any hold upon the free states that no other man can give you any strength in the free states
this being so
if you doubt the other branch of the proposition
whether he is for you whether he is really for you
as i have expressed it
i propose asking your attention for a while to a few facts
the issue between you and me
that i think slavery is wrong
and ought not to be outspread and you think it is right
and ought to be extended and perpetuated
a voice
that is my kentuckian i am talking to now
i now proceed to try to show you that douglas is as sincerely for you and more wisely for you than you are for yourselves
in the first place
we know that in a government like this
in a government of the people
where the voice of all the men of the country
enters into the execution or administration
rather of the government
in such a government
what lies at the bottom of all of it is public opinion
i lay down the proposition
that judge douglas is not only the man that promises you in advance a hold upon the north
and support in the north
but he constantly moulds public opinion to your ends that in every possible way he can he constantly moulds the public opinion of the north to your ends and if there are a few things in which he seems to be against you
a few things which he says that appear to be against you
and a few that he forbears to say which you would like to have him say you ought to remember that the saying of the one
or the forbearing to say the other
would lose his hold upon the north
by consequence
would lose his capacity to serve you
upon this subject of moulding public opinion i call your attention to the fact for a well established fact it is that the judge never says your institution of slavery is wrong
there is not a public man in the united states
i believe
with the exception of senator douglas
who has not
at some time in his life
declared his opinion whether the thing is right or wrong but senator douglas never declares it is wrong
he leaves himself at perfect liberty to do all in your favor which he would be hindered from doing if he were to declare the thing to be wrong
on the contrary
he takes all the chances that he has for inveigling the sentiment of the north
opposed to slavery
into your support
by never saying it is right
this you ought to set down to his credit
you ought to give him full credit for this much little though it be
in comparison to the whole which he does for you
some other
things i will ask your attention to
he said upon the floor of the united states senate
and he has repeated it
as i understand
a great many times
that he does not care whether slavery is voted up or voted down
this again shows you
or ought to show you
if you would reason upon it
that he does not believe it to be wrong for a man may say when he sees nothing wrong in a thing that he
dues not care whether it be voted up or voted down but no man can logically say that he cares not whether a thing goes up or goes down which to him appears to be wrong
you therefore have a demonstration in this that to judge douglas's mind your favorite institution
which you would have spread out and made perpetual
is no wrong
another thing he tells you
in a speech made at memphis in tennessee
shortly after the canvass in illinois
last year
he there distinctly told the people that there was a line drawn by the almighty across this continent
on the one side of which the soil must always be cultivated by slaves that he did not pretend to know exactly where that line was
but that there was such a line
i want to ask your attention to that proposition again that there is one portion of this continent where the almighty has signed the soil shall always be cultivated by slaves that its being cultivated by slaves at that place is right that it has the direct sympathy and authority of the almighty
whenever you can get these northern audiences to adopt the opinion that slavery is right on the other side of the ohio
whenever you can get them
in pursuance of douglas's views
to adopt that sentiment
they will very readily make the other argument
which is perfectly logical
that that which is right on that side of the ohio cannot be wrong on this
and that if you have that property on that side of the ohio
under the seal and stamp of the almighty
when by any means it escapes over here it is wrong to have constitutions and laws to devil you about it
so douglas is moulding the public opinion of the north
first to say that the thing is right in your state over the ohio river
and hence to say that that which is right there is not wrong here
and that all laws and constitutions here recognizing it as being wrong are themselves wrong
and ought to be repealed and abrogated
he will tell you
men of ohio
that if you choose here to have laws against slavery
it is in conformity to the idea that your climate is not suited to it
that your climate is not suited to slave labor
and therefore you have constitutions and laws against it
let us attend to that argument for a little while and see if it be sound
you do not raise sugar cane except the new fashioned sugar cane
and you won't raise that long
but they do raise it in louisiana
you don't raise it in ohio
because you can't raise it profitably
because the climate don't suit it
they do raise it in louisiana
because there it is profitable
douglas will tell you that is precisely the slavery question
that they do have slaves there because they are profitable
and you don't have them here because they are not profitable
if that is so
then it leads to dealing with the one precisely as with the other
is there
anything in the constitution or laws of ohio against raising sugar cane
have you found it necessary to put any such provision in your law
surely not
no man desires to raise sugar cane in ohio
but if any man did desire to do so
you would say it was a tyrannical law that forbids his doing so and whenever you shall agree with douglas
whenever your minds are brought to adopt his argument
as surely you will have reached the conclusion that although it is not profitable in ohio
if any man wants it
is wrong to him not to let him have it
in this matter judge douglas is preparing the public mind for you of kentucky to make perpetual that good thing in your estimation
about which you and i differ
in this connection
let me ask your attention to another thing
i believe it is safe to assert that five years ago no living man had expressed the opinion that the negro had no share in the declaration of independence
let me state that again
five years ago no living man had expressed the opinion that the negro had no share in the declaration of independence
if there is in this large audience any man who ever knew of that opinion being put upon paper as much as five years ago
i will be obliged to him now or at a subsequent time to show it
if that be true i wish you then to note the next fact
that within the space of five years senator douglas
in the argument of this question
has got his entire party
so far as i know
without exception
in saying that the negro has no share in the declaration of independence
if there be now in all these united states one douglas man that does not say this
i have been unable upon any occasion to scare him up
if none of you said this five years ago
and all of you say it now
that is a matter that you kentuckians ought to note
that is a vast change in the northern public sentiment upon that question
of what tendency is that change
the tendency of that change is to bring the public mind to the conclusion that when men are spoken of
the negro is not meant that when negroes are spoken of
brutes alone are contemplated
that change in public sentiment has already degraded the black man in the estimation of douglas and his followers from the condition of a man of some sort
and assigned him to the condition of a brute
you kentuckians ought to give douglas credit for this
that is the largest possible stride that can be made in regard to the perpetuation of your thing of slavery
a voice
speak to ohio men
and not to kentuckians
i beg permission to speak as i please
in kentucky perhaps
in many of the slave states certainly
you are trying to establish the rightfulness of slavery by reference to the bible
you are trying to show that slavery existed in the bible times by divine ordinance
douglas is wiser than you
for your own benefit
upon that subject
douglas knows that whenever you establish that slavery was right by the bible
it will occur that that slavery was the slavery of the white man
of men without reference to color and he knows very well that you may entertain that idea in kentucky as much as you please
but you will never win any northern support upon it
he makes a wiser argument for you
he makes the argument that the slavery of the black man the slavery of the man who has a skin of a different color from your own
is right
he thereby brings to your support northern voters who could not for a moment be brought by your own argument of the bible right of slavery
will you give him credit for that
will you not say that in this matter he is more wisely for you than you are for yourselves
having established with his entire party this doctrine
having been entirely successful in that branch of his efforts in your behalf
he is ready for another
at this same meeting at memphis he declared that in all contests between the negro and the white man he was for the white man
but that in all questions between the negro and the crocodile he was for the negro
he did not make that declaration accidentally at memphis
he made it a great many times in the canvass in illinois last year though i don't know that it was reported in any of his speeches there
but he frequently made it
i believe he repeated it at columbus
and i should not wonder if he repeated it here
it is
a deliberate way of expressing himself upon that subject
it is a matter of mature deliberation with him thus to express himself upon that point of his case
it therefore requires deliberate attention
the first inference seems to be that if you do not enslave the negro
you are wronging the white man in some way or other
and that whoever is opposed to the negro being enslaved
in some way or other
against the white man
is not that a falsehood
if there was a necessary conflict between the white man and the negro
i should be for the white man as much as judge douglas but i say there is no such necessary conflict
i say that there is room enough for us all to be free
and that it not only does not wrong the white man that the negro should be free
but it positively wrongs the mass of the white men that the negro should be enslaved that the mass of white men are really injured by the effects of slave labor in the vicinity of the fields of their own labor
but i do not desire to dwell upon this branch of the question more than to say that this assumption of his is false
and i do hope that that fallacy will not long prevail in the minds of intelligent white men
at all events
you ought to thank judge douglas for it it is for your benefit it is made
the other branch of it is
that in the struggle between the negro and the crocodile he is for the negro
i don't know that there is any struggle between the negro and the crocodile
i suppose that if a crocodile or
as we old ohio river boatmen used to call them
alligators should come across a white man
he would kill him if he could and so he would a negro
but what
at last
is this proposition
i believe it is a sort of proposition in proportion
which may be stated thus
as the negro is to the white man
so is the crocodile to the negro and as the negro may rightfully treat the crocodile as a beast or reptile
so the white man may rightfully treat the negro as a beast or a reptile
that is really the knip of all that argument of his
my brother kentuckians
who believe in this
you ought to thank judge douglas for having put that in a much more taking way than any of yourselves have done
douglas's great principle
popular sovereignty
as he calls it
gives you
by natural consequence
the revival of the slave trade whenever you want it
if you question this
listen awhile
consider awhile what i shall advance in support of that proposition
he says that it is the sacred right of the man who goes into the territories to have slavery if he wants it
grant that for argument's sake
is it not the sacred right of the man who don't go there equally to buy slaves in africa
if he wants them
can you point out the difference
the man who goes into the territories of kansas and nebraska
or any other new territory
with the sacred right of taking a slave there which belongs to him
would certainly have no more right to take one there than i would
who own no slave
but who would desire to buy one and take him there
you will not say you
the friends of judge douglas but that the man who does not own a slave has an equal right to buy one and take him to the territory as the other does
a voice
i want to ask a question
don't foreign nations interfere with the slave trade
i understand it to be a principle of democracy to whip foreign nations whenever
they interfere with us
i only asked for information
i am a republican myself
you and i will be on the best terms in the world
but i do not wish to be diverted from the point i was trying to press
i say that douglas's popular sovereignty
establishing his sacred right in the people
if you please
if carried to its logical conclusion gives equally the sacred right to the people of the states or the territories themselves to buy slaves wherever they can buy them cheapest and if any man can show a distinction
i should like to hear him try it
if any man can show how the people of kansas have a better right to slaves
because they want them
than the people of georgia have to buy them in africa
i want him to do it
i think it cannot be done
if it is popular sovereignty for the people to have slaves because they want them
it is popular sovereignty for them to buy them in africa because they desire to do so
i know that douglas has recently made a little effort
not seeming to notice that he had a different theory
has made an effort to get rid of that
he has written a letter
addressed to somebody
i believe
who resides in iowa
declaring his opposition to the repeal of the laws that prohibit the africa slave trade
he bases his opposition to such repeal upon the ground that these laws are themselves one of the compromises of the constitution of the united states
it would be very interesting to see judge douglas or any of his friends turn
to the constitution of the united states and point out that compromise
to show where there is any compromise in the constitution
or provision in the constitution express or implied
by which the administrators of that constitution are under any obligation to repeal the african slave trade
i know
or at least i think i know
that the framers of that constitution did expect the african slave trade would be abolished at the end of twenty years
to which time their prohibition against its being abolished extended there is abundant contemporaneous history to show that the framers of the constitution expected it to be abolished
but while they so expected
they gave nothing for that expectation
and they put no provision in the constitution requiring it should be so abolished
the migration or importation of such persons as the states shall see fit to admit shall not be prohibited
but a certain tax might be levied upon such importation
but what was to be done after that time
the constitution is as silent about that as it is silent
about myself
there is absolutely nothing in it about that subject there is only the expectation of the framers of the constitution that the slave trade would be abolished at the end of that time and they expected it would be abolished
owing to public sentiment
before that time and the put that provision in
in order that it should not be abolished before that time
for reasons which i suppose they thought to be sound ones
but which i will not now try to enumerate before you
but while
they expected the slave trade would be abolished at that time
they expected that the spread of slavery into the new territories should also be restricted
it is as easy to prove that the framers of the constitution of the united states expected that slavery should be prohibited from extending into the new territories
as it is to prove that it was expected that the slave trade should be abolished
both these things were expected
one was no more expected than the other
and one was no more a compromise of the constitution than the other
there was nothing said in the constitution in regard to the spread of slavery into the territory
i grant that but there was something very important said about it by the same generation of men in the adoption of the old ordinance of '87
through the influence of which you here in ohio
our neighbors in indiana
we in illinois
our neighbors in michigan and wisconsin
are happy
teeming millions of free men
that generation of men
though not to the full extent members of the convention that framed the constitution
were to some extent members of that convention
holding seats at the same time in one body and the other
so that if there was any compromise on either of these subjects
the strong evidence is that that compromise was in favor of the restriction of slavery from the new territories
but douglas says that he is unalterably opposed to the repeal of those laws because
in his view
it is a compromise of the constitution
you kentuckians
no doubt
are somewhat offended with that
you ought not to be
you ought to be patient
you ought to know that if he said less than that
he would lose the power of lugging the northern states to your support
what you would push him to do would take from him his entire power to serve you
and you ought to remember how long
by precedent
judge douglas holds himself obliged to stick by compromises
you ought to remember that by the time you yourselves think you are ready to inaugurate measures for the revival of the african slave trade
that sufficient time will have arrived
by precedent
for judge douglas to break through
that compromise
he says now nothing more strong than he said in 1849 when he declared in favor of missouri compromise
and precisely four years and a quarter after he declared that compromise to be a sacred thing
which no ruthless hand would ever daze to touch
he himself brought forward the measure ruthlessly to destroy it
by a mere calculation of time it will only be four years more until he is ready to take back his profession about the sacredness of the compromise abolishing the slave trade
precisely as soon as you are ready to have his services in that direction
by fair calculation
you may be sure of having them
but you remember and set down to judge douglas's debt
or discredit
that he
last year
said the people of territories can
in spite of the dred scott decision
exclude your slaves from those territories that he declared
by unfriendly legislation the extension of your property into the new territories may be cut off
in the teeth of the decision of the supreme court of the united states
he assumed that position at freeport on the 27th of august
he said that the people of the territories can exclude slavery
in so many words
you ought
to bear in mind that he has never said it since
you may hunt in every speech that he has since made
and he has never used that expression once
he has never seemed to notice that he is stating his views differently from what he did then but by some sort of accident
he has always really stated it differently
he has always since then declared that the constitution does not carry slavery into the territories of the united states beyond the power of the people legally to control it
as other property
now
there is a difference in the language used upon that former occasion and in this latter day
there may or may not be a difference in the meaning
but it is worth while considering whether there is not also a difference in meaning
what is it to exclude
it is to drive it out
it is in some way to put it out of the territory
it is to force it across the line
or change its character so that
as property
it is out of existence
but what is the controlling of it as other property
is controlling it as other property the same thing as destroying it
or driving it away
i should think not
i should think the controlling of it as other property would be just about what you in kentucky should want
i understand the controlling of property means the controlling of it for the benefit of the owner of it
while i have no doubt the supreme court of the united states would say god speed to any of the territorial legislatures that should thus control slave property
they would sing quite a different tune if
by the pretence of controlling it
they were to undertake to pass laws which virtually excluded it
and that upon a very well known principle to all lawyers
that what a legislature cannot directly do
it cannot do by indirection that as the legislature has not the power to drive slaves out
they have no power
by indirection
by tax
or by imposing burdens in any way on that property
to effect the same end
and that any attempt to do so would be held by the dred scott court unconstitutional
douglas is not willing to stand by his first proposition that they can exclude it
because we have seen that that proposition amounts to nothing more nor less than the naked absurdity that you may lawfully drive out that which has a lawful right to remain
he admitted at first that the slave might be lawfully taken into the territories under the constitution of the united states
and yet asserted that he might be lawfully driven out
that being the proposition
it is the absurdity i have stated
he is not willing to stand in the face of that direct
and impudent absurdity he has
modified his language into that of being controlled as other property
the kentuckians don't like this in douglas
i will tell you where it will go
he now swears by the court
he was once a leading man in illinois to break down a court
because it had made a decision he did not like
but he now not only swears by the court
the courts having got to working for you
but he denounces all men that do not swear by the courts
as unpatriotic
as bad citizens
when one of these acts of unfriendly legislation shall impose such heavy burdens as to
in effect
destroy property in slaves in a territory
and show plainly enough that there can be no mistake in the purpose of the legislature to make them so burdensome
this same supreme court will decide that law to be unconstitutional
and he will be ready to say for your benefit i swear by the court i give it up and while that is going on he has been getting all his men to swear by the courts
and to give it up with him
in this again he serves you faithfully
as i say
more wisely than you serve yourselves
i have alluded in the beginning of these remarks to the fact that judge douglas has made great complaint of my having expressed the opinion that this government cannot endure permanently
half slave and half free
he has complained of seward for using different language
and declaring that there is an irrepressible conflict between the principles of free and slave labor
a voice
he says it is not original with seward
that it is original with lincoln
i will attend to that immediately
since that time
hickman of pennsylvania expressed the same sentiment
he has never denounced mr
there is a little chance
notwithstanding that opinion in the mouth of hickman
that he may yet be a douglas man
that is the difference
it is not unpatriotic to hold that opinion if a man is a douglas man
but neither i
nor seward
nor hickman is entitled to the enviable or unenviable distinction of having first expressed that idea
that same idea was expressed by the richmond enquirer
in virginia
in 1856
quite two years before it was expressed by the first of us
and while douglas was pluming himself that in his conflict with my humble self
last year
he had squelched out that fatal heresy
as he delighted to call it
and had suggested that if he only had had a chance to be in new york and meet seward he would have squelched it there also
it never occurred to him to breathe a word against pryor
i don't think that you can discover that douglas ever talked of going to virginia to squelch out that idea there
more than that
that same roger a
pryor was brought to washington city and made the editor of the par excellence douglas paper
after making use of that expression
in us
is so unpatriotic and heretical
from all this
my kentucky friends may see that this opinion is heretical in his view only when it is expressed by men suspected of a desire that the country shall all become free
and not when expressed by those fairly known to entertain the desire that the whole country shall become slave
when expressed by that class of men
it is in nowise offensive to him
in this again
my friends of kentucky
you have judge douglas with you
there is another reason why you southern people ought to nominate douglas at your convention at charleston
that reason is the wonderful capacity of the man
the power he has of doing what would seem to be impossible
let me call your attention to one of these apparently impossible things
douglas had three or four very distinguished men of the most extreme anti slavery views of any men in the republican party expressing their desire for his re election to the senate last year
that would
of itself
have seemed to be a little wonderful but that wonder is heightened when we see that wise of virginia
a man exactly opposed to them
a man who believes in the divine right of slavery
was also expressing his desire that douglas should be reelected that another man that may be said to be kindred to wise
the vice president
and of your own state
was also agreeing with the anti slavery men in the north that douglas ought to be re elected
still to heighten the wonder
a senator from kentucky
whom i have always loved with an affection as tender and endearing as i have ever loved any man
who was opposed to the anti slavery men for reasons which seemed sufficient to him
and equally opposed to wise and breckinridge
was writing letters into illinois to secure the reelection of douglas
that all these conflicting elements should be brought
while at daggers' points with one another
to support him
is a feat that is worthy for you to note and consider
it is quite probable that each of these classes of men thought
by the re election of douglas
their peculiar views would gain something
it is probable that the anti slavery men thought their views would gain something that wise and breckinridge thought so too
as regards their opinions that mr
crittenden thought that his views would gain something
although he was opposed to both these other men
it is probable that each and all of them thought that they were using douglas and it is yet an unsolved problem whether he was not using them all
if he was
then it is for you to consider whether that power to perform wonders is one for you lightly to throw away
there is one other thing that i will say to you
in this relation
it is but my opinion
i give it to you without a fee
it is my opinion that it is for you to take him or be defeated and that if you do take him you may be beaten
you will surely be beaten if you do not take him
the republicans and others forming the opposition of the country
intend to stand by our guns
to be patient and firm
and in the long run to beat you
whether you take him or not
we know that before we fairly beat you we have to beat you both together
we know that you are all of a feather
and that we have to beat you all together
and we expect to do it
we don't intend to be very impatient about it
we mean to be as deliberate and calm about it as it is possible to be
but as firm and resolved as it is possible for men to be
when we do as we say
beat you
you perhaps want to know what we will do with you
i will tell you
so far as i am authorized to speak for the opposition
what we mean to do with you
we mean to treat you
as near as we possibly can
as washington
and madison treated you
we mean to leave you alone
and in no way interfere with your institution to abide by all and every compromise of the constitution
in a word
coming back to the original proposition
to treat you
so far as degenerated men if we have degenerated may
according to the examples of those noble fathers
and madison
we mean to remember that you are as good as we that there is no difference between us other than the difference of circumstances
we mean to recognize and bear in mind always that you have as good hearts in your bosoms as other people
or as we claim to have
and treat you accordingly
we mean to marry your girls when we have a chance
the white ones i mean and i have the honor to inform you that i once did have a chance in that way
i have told you what we mean to do
i want to know
when that thing takes place
what do you mean to do
i often hear it intimated that you mean to divide the union whenever a republican
or anything like it
is elected president of the united states
a voice
that is so
that is so
one of them says i wonder if he is a kentuckian
a voice
he is a douglas man
well
i want to know what you are going to do with your half of it
are you going to split the ohio down through
and push your half off a piece
or are you going to keep it right alongside of us outrageous fellows
or are you going to build up a wall some way between your country and ours
by which that movable property of yours can't come over here any more
to the danger of your losing it
do you think you can better yourselves
on that subject
by leaving us here under no obligation whatever to return those specimens of your movable property that come hither
you have divided the union because we would not do right with you
as you think
upon that subject when we cease to be under obligations to do anything for you
how much better off do you think you will be
will you make war upon us and kill us all
i think you are as gallant and as brave men as live that you can fight as bravely in a good cause
man for man
as any other people living that you have shown yourselves capable of this upon various occasions
man for man
you are not better than we are
and there are not so many of you as there are of us
you will never make much of a hand at whipping us
if we were fewer in numbers than you
i think that you could whip us if we were equal
it would likely be a drawn battle but being inferior in numbers
you will make nothing by attempting to master us
but perhaps i have addressed myself as long
or longer
to the kentuckians than i ought to have done
inasmuch as i have said that whatever course you take we intend in the end to beat you
i propose to address a few remarks to our friends
by way of discussing with them the best means of keeping that promise that i have in good faith made
it may appear a little episodical for me to mention the topic of which i will speak now
it is a favorite position of douglas's that the interference of the general government
through the ordinance of '87
or through any other act of the general government never has made or ever can make a free state the ordinance of '87 did not make free states of ohio
or illinois that these states are free upon his great principle of popular sovereignty
because the people of those several states have chosen to make them so
at columbus
and probably here
he undertook to compliment the people that they themselves have made the state of ohio free
and that the ordinance of '87 was not entitled in any degree to divide the honor with them
i have no doubt that the people of the state of ohio did make her free according to their own will and judgment
but let the facts be remembered
in 1802
i believe
it was you who made your first constitution
with the clause prohibiting slavery
and you did it
i suppose
very nearly unanimously but you should bear in mind that you speaking of you as one people that you did so unembarrassed by the actual presence of the institution amongst you that you made it a free state not with the embarrassment upon you of already having among you many slaves
which if they had been here
and you had sought to make a free state
you would not know what to do with
if they had been among you
embarrassing difficulties
most probably
would have induced you to tolerate a slave constitution instead of a free one
as indeed these very difficulties have constrained every people on this continent who have adopted slavery
pray what was it that made you free
what kept you free
did you not find your country free when you came to decide that ohio should be a free state
it is important to inquire by what reason you found it so
let us take an illustration between the states of ohio and kentucky
kentucky is separated by this river ohio
not a mile wide
a portion of kentucky
by reason of the course of the ohio
is farther north than this portion of ohio
in which we now stand
kentucky is entirely covered with slavery ohio is entirely free from it
what made that difference
was it climate
a portion of kentucky was farther north than this portion of ohio
was it soil
there is nothing in the soil of the one more favorable to slave than the other
it was not climate or soil that mused one side of the line to be entirely covered with slavery
and the other side free of it
what was it
study over it
tell us
if you can
in all the range of conjecture
if there be anything you can conceive of that made that difference
other than that there was no law of any sort keeping it out of kentucky
while the ordinance of '87 kept it out of ohio
if there is any other reason than this
i confess that it is wholly beyond my power to conceive of it
i offer to combat the idea that that ordinance has never made any state free
i don't stop at this illustration
i come to the state of indiana and what i have said as between kentucky and ohio
i repeat as between indiana and kentucky
it is equally applicable
one additional argument is applicable also to indiana
in her territorial condition she more than once petitioned congress to abrogate the ordinance entirely
or at least so far as to suspend its operation for a time
in order that they should exercise the popular sovereignty of having slaves if they wanted them
the men then controlling the general government
imitating the men of the revolution
refused indiana that privilege
and so we have the evidence that indiana supposed she could have slaves
if it were not for that ordinance that she besought congress to put that barrier out of the way that congress refused to do so and it all ended at last in indiana being a free state
tell me not then that the ordinance of '87 had nothing to do with making indiana a free state
when we find some men chafing against
and only restrained by
that barrier
come down again to our state of illinois
the great northwest territory
including ohio
and wisconsin
was acquired first
i believe
by the british government
in part at least
from the french
before the establishment of our independence it became a part of virginia
enabling virginia afterward to transfer it to the general government
there were french settlements in what is now illinois
and at the same time there were french settlements in what is now missouri
in the tract of country that was not purchased till about 1803
in these french settlements negro slavery had existed for many years
perhaps more than a hundred if not as much as two hundred years
at kaskaskia
in illinois
and at st
or cape girardeau
in missouri
the number of slaves was not very great
but there was about the same number in each place
they were there when we acquired the territory
there was no effort made to break up the relation of master and slave
and even the ordinance of 1787 was not so enforced as to destroy that slavery in illinois nor did the ordinance apply to missouri at all
what i want to ask your attention to at this point
is that illinois and missouri came into the union about the same time
illinois in the latter part of 1818
and missouri
after a struggle
i believe sometime in 1820
they had been filling up with american people about the same period of time their progress enabling them to come into the union about the same time
at the end of that ten years
in which they had been so preparing for it was about that period of time
the number of slaves in illinois had actually decreased while in missouri
beginning with very few
at the end of that ten years there were about ten thousand
this being so
and it being remembered that missouri and illinois are
to a certain extent
in the same parallel of latitude
that the northern half of missouri and the southern half of illinois are in the same parallel of latitude
so that climate would have the same effect upon one as upon the other
and that in the soil there is no material difference so far as bears upon the question of slavery being settled upon one or the other
there being none of those natural causes to produce a difference in filling them
and yet there being a broad difference to their filling up
we are led again to inquire what was the cause of that difference
it is most natural to say that in missouri there was no law to keep that country from filling up with slaves
while in illinois there was the ordinance of the ordinance being there
slavery decreased during that ten years the ordinance not being in the other
it increased from a few to ten thousand
can anybody doubt the reason of the difference
i think all these facts most abundantly prove that my friend judge douglas's proposition
that the ordinance of '87
or the national restriction of slavery
never had a tendency to make a free state
is a fallacy
a proposition without the shadow or substance of truth about it
douglas sometimes says that all the states and it is part of this same proposition i have been discussing that have become free have become so upon his great principle that the state of illinois itself came into the union as a slave state
and that the people
upon the great principle of popular sovereignty
have since made it a free state
allow me but a little while to state to you what facts there are to justify him in saying that illinois came into the union as a slave state
i have mentioned to you that there were a few old french slaves there
they numbered
i think
one or two hundred
besides that
there had been a territorial law for indenturing black persons
under that law
in violation of the ordinance of '87
but without any enforcement of the ordinance to overthrow the system
there had been a small number of slaves introduced as indentured persons
owing to this
the clause for the prohibition of slavery was slightly modified
instead of running like yours
that neither slavery nor involuntary servitude
except for crime
of which the party shall have been duly convicted
should exist in the state
they said that neither slavery nor involuntary servitude should thereafter be introduced and that the children of indentured servants should be born free and nothing was said about the few old french slaves
out of this fact
that the clause for prohibiting slavery was modified because of the actual presence of it
douglas asserts again and again that illinois came into the union as a slave state
how far the facts sustain the conclusion that he draws
it is for intelligent and impartial men to decide
i leave it with you
with these remarks
worthy of being remembered
that that little thing
those few indentured servants being there
was of itself sufficient to modify a constitution made by a people ardently desiring to have a free constitution showing the power of the actual presence of the institution of slavery to prevent any people
however anxious to make a free state
from making it perfectly so
i have been detaining you longer
than i ought to do
i am in some doubt whether to introduce another topic upon which i could talk a while
cries of go on
and give us it
it is this
douglas's popular sovereignty
as a principle
is simply this
if one man chooses to make a slave of another man
neither that man nor anybody else has a right to object
apply it to government
as he seeks to apply it
and it is this
in a new territory into which a few people are beginning to enter for the purpose of making their homes
they choose to either exclude slavery from their limits
or to establish it there
however one or the other may affect the persons to be enslaved
or the infinitely greater number of persons who are afterward to inhabit that territory
or the other members of the family of communities of which they are but an incipient member
or the general head of the family of states as parent of all
however their action may affect one or the other of these
there is no power or right to interfere
that is douglas's popular sovereignty applied
i think that there is a real popular sovereignty in the world
i think the definition of popular sovereignty
in the abstract
would be about this
that each man shall do precisely as he pleases with himself
and with all those things which exclusively concern him
applied in government
this principle would be that a general government shall do all those things which pertain to it
and all the local governments shall do precisely as they please in respect to those matters which exclusively concern them
douglas looks upon slavery as so insignificant that the people must decide that question for themselves and yet they are not fit to decide who shall be their governor
or secretary
or who shall be any of their officers
these are vast national matters in his estimation but the little matter in his estimation is that of planting slavery there
that is purely of local interest
which nobody should be allowed to say a word about
labor is the great source from which nearly all
if not all
human comforts and necessities are drawn
there is a difference in opinion about the elements of labor in society
some men assume that there is necessary connection between capital and labor
and that connection draws within it the whole of the labor of the community
they assume that nobody works unless capital excites them to work
they begin next to consider what is the best way
they say there are but two ways
one is to hire men
and to allure them to labor by their consent the other is to buy the men
and drive them
to it
and that is slavery
having assumed that
they proceed to discuss the question of whether the laborers themselves are better off in the condition of slaves or of hired laborers
and they usually decide that they are better off in the condition of slaves
in the first place
i say that the whole thing is a mistake
that there is a certain relation between capital and labor
i admit
that it does exist
and rightfully exists
i think is true
that men who are industrious
and sober
and honest in the pursuit of their own interests should after a while accumulate capital
and after that should be allowed to enjoy it in peace
and also
if they should choose
when they have accumulated it
to use it to save themselves from actual labor
and hire other people to labor for them
is right
in doing so they do not wrong the man they employ
for they find men who have not of their own land to work upon
or shops to work in
and who are benefited by working for others
hired laborers
receiving their capital for it
thus a few men
that own capital
hire a few others
and these establish the relation of capital and labor rightfully
a relation of which i make no complaint
but i insist that that relation
after all
does not embrace more than one eighth of the labor of the country
the speaker proceeded to argue that the hired laborer
with his ability to become an employer
must have every precedence over him who labors under the inducement of force
he continued
i have taken upon myself in the name of some of you to say that we expect upon these principles to ultimately beat them
in order to do so
i think we want and must have a national policy in regard to the institution of slavery that acknowledges and deals with that institution as being wrong
whoever desires the prevention of the spread of slavery and the nationalization of that institution yields all when he yields to any policy that either recognizes slavery as being right or as being an indifferent thing
nothing will make you successful but setting up a policy which shall treat the thing as being wrong
when i say this
i do not mean to say that this general government is charged with the duty of redressing or preventing all the wrongs in the world
but i do think that it is charged with preventing and redressing all wrongs which are wrongs to itself
this government is expressly charged with the duty of providing for the general welfare
we believe that the spreading out and perpetuity of the institution of slavery impairs the general welfare
we believe nay
we know that that is the only thing that has ever threatened the perpetuity of the union itself
the only thing which has ever menaced the destruction of the government under which we live is this very thing
to repress this thing
we think
providing for the general welfare
our friends in kentucky differ from us
we need not make our argument for them
but we who think it is wrong in all its relations
or in some of them at least
must decide as to our own actions and our own course
upon our own judgment
i say that we must not interfere with the institution of slavery in the states where it exists
because the constitution forbids it
and the general welfare does not require us to do so
we must not withhold an efficient fugitive slave law
because the constitution requires us
as i understand it
not to withhold such a law
but we must prevent the outspreading of the institution
because neither the constitution nor general welfare requires us to extend it
we must prevent the revival of the african slave trade
and the enacting by congress of a territorial slave code
we must prevent each of these things being done by either congresses or courts
the people of these united states are the rightful masters of both congresses and courts
not to overthrow the constitution
but to overthrow the men who pervert the constitution
to do these things we must employ instrumentalities
we must hold conventions we must adopt platforms
if we conform to ordinary custom we must nominate candidates and we must carry elections
in all these things
i think that we ought to keep in view our real purpose
and in none do anything that stands adverse to our purpose
if we shall adopt a platform that fails to recognize or express our purpose
or elect a man that declares himself inimical to our purpose
we not only take nothing by our success
but we tacitly admit that we act upon no other principle than a desire to have the loaves and fishes
by which
in the end
our apparent success is really an injury to us
i know that this is very desirable with me
as with everybody else
that all the elements of the opposition shall unite in the next presidential election and in all future time
i am anxious that that should be but there are things seriously to be considered in relation to that matter
if the terms can be arranged
i am in favor of the union
but suppose we shall take up some man
and put him upon one end or the other of the ticket
who declares himself against us in regard to the prevention of the spread of slavery
who turns up his nose and says he is tired of hearing anything more about it
who is more against us than against the enemy
what will be the issue
he will get no slave states
after all
he has tried that already until being beat is the rule for him
if we nominate him upon that ground
he will not carry a slave state and not only so
but that portion of our men who are high strung upon the principle we really fight for will not go for him
and he won't get a single electoral vote anywhere
in the state of maryland
there is no use in saying to us that we are stubborn and obstinate because we won't do some such thing as this
we cannot do it
we cannot get our men to vote it
i speak by the card
that we cannot give the state of illinois in such case by fifty thousand
we would be flatter down than the negro democracy themselves have the heart to wish to see us
after saying this much let me say a little on the other side
there are plenty of men in the slave states that are altogether good enough for me to be either president or vice president
provided they will profess their sympathy with our purpose
and will place themselves on the ground that our men
upon principle
can vote for them
there are scores of them
good men in their character for intelligence and talent and integrity
if such a one will place himself upon the right ground
i am for his occupying one place upon the next republican or opposition ticket
i will heartily go for him
but unless he does so place himself
i think it a matter of perfect nonsense to attempt to bring about a union upon any other basis that if a union be made
the elements will scatter so that there can be no success for such a ticket
nor anything like success
the good old maxims of the bible axe applicable
and truly applicable
to human affairs
and in this
as in other things
we may say here that he who is not for us is against us he who gathereth not with us
i should be glad to have some of the many good and able and noble men of the south to place themselves where we can confer upon them the high honor of an election upon one or the other end of our ticket
it would do my soul good to do that thing
it would enable us to teach them that
inasmuch as we select one of their own number to carry out our principles
we are free from the charge that we mean more than we say
my friends
i have detained you much longer than i expected to do
i believe i may do myself the compliment to say that you have stayed and heard me with great patience
for which i return you my most sincere thanks
on protective tariffs to edward wallace
october 11
1859 dr
edward wallace
my dear sir
i am here just now attending court
before i left springfield
your brother
william s
showed me a letter of yours
in which you kindly mention my name
inquiring for my tariff views
and suggest the propriety of my writing a letter upon the subject
i was an old henry clay tariff whig
in old times i made more speeches on that subject than any other
i have not since changed my views
i believe yet
if we could have a moderate
carefully adjusted protective tariff
so far acquiesced in as not to be a perpetual subject of political strife
squabbles changes
and uncertainties
it would be better for us
still it is my opinion that just now the revival of that question will not advance the cause itself
or the man who revives it
i have not thought much on the subject recently
but my general impression is that the necessity for a protective tariff will ere long force its old opponents to take it up and then its old friends can join in and establish it on a more firm and durable basis
the old whigs
have been entirely beaten out on the tariff question
and we shall not be able to re establish the policy until the absence of it shall have demonstrated the necessity for it in the minds of men heretofore opposed to it
with this view
i should prefer to not now write a public letter on the subject
i therefore wish this to be considered confidential
i shall be very glad to receive a letter from you
yours truly
on mortgages to w
dear sir
yours of october 27 is received
when a mortgage is given to secure two notes
and one of the notes is sold and assigned
if the mortgaged premises are only sufficient to pay one note
the one assigned will take it all
an execution from a judgment on the assigned note may take it all it being the same thing in substance
there is redemption on execution sales from the united states court just as from any other court
you did not mention the name of the plaintiff or defendant in the suit
and so i can tell nothing about it as to sales
write again
yours truly
fragment of speech at leavenworth
but you democrats are for the union and you greatly fear the success of the republicans would destroy the union
do the republicans declare against the union
nothing like it
your own statement of it is that if the black republicans elect a president
you won't stand it
you will break up the union
if we shall constitutionally elect a president
it will be our duty to see that you submit
old john brown has been executed for treason against a state
we cannot object
even though he agreed with us in thinking slavery wrong
that cannot excuse violence
bloodshed and treason
it could avail him nothing that he might think himself right
if we constitutionally elect a president
and therefore you undertake to destroy the union
it will be our duty to deal with you as old john brown has been dealt with
we shall try to do our duty
we hope and believe that in no section will a majority so act as to render such extreme measures necessary
to g
and w
1859 messrs
hubbard brown
your favor of the 12th is at hand
and it gives me pleasure to be able to answer it
it is not my intention to take part in any of the rivalries for the gubernatorial nomination but the fear of being misunderstood upon that subject ought not to deter me from doing justice to mr
and preventing a wrong being done to him by the use of nay name in connection with alleged wrongs to me
in answer to your first question
as to whether mr
judd was guilty of any unfairness to me at the time of senator trumbull's election
i answer unhesitatingly in the negative mr
judd owed no political allegiance to any party whose candidate i was
he was in the senate
holding over
having been elected by a democratic constituency
he never was in any caucus of the friends who sought to make me u
never gave me any promises or pledges to support me
and subsequent events have greatly tended to prove the wisdom
of mr
judd's course
the election of judge trumbull strongly tended to sustain and preserve the position of that lion of the democrats who condemned the repeal of the missouri compromise
and left them in a position of joining with us in forming the republican party
as was done at the bloomington convention in 1856
during the canvass of 1858 for the senatorship my belief was
and still is
that i had no more sincere and faithful friend than mr
judd certainly none whom i trusted more
his position as chairman of the state central committee led to my greater intercourse with him
and to my giving him a larger share of my confidence
than with or to almost any other friend and i have never suspected that that confidence was
to any degree
my relations with mr
judo since the organization of the republican party
our state
in 1856
and especially since the adjournment of the legislature in feb
have been so very intimate that i deem it an impossibility that he could have been dealing treacherously with me
he has also
at all times
appeared equally true and faithful to the party
in his position as chairman of the committee
i believe he did all that any man could have done
the best of us are liable to commit errors
which become apparent by subsequent developments but i do not know of a single error
committed by mr
since he and i have acted together politically
had occasionally heard these insinuations against mr
before the receipt of your letter and in no instance have i hesitated to pronounce them wholly unjust
to the full extent of my knowledge and belief
i have been
and still am
very anxious to take no part between the many friends
all good and true
who are mentioned as candidates for a republican gubernatorial nomination but i can not feel that my own honor is quite clear if i remain silent when i hear any one of them assailed about matters of which i believe i know more than his assailants
i take pleasure in adding that
of all the avowed friends i had in the canvass of last year
i do not suspect any of having acted treacherously to me
or to our cause and that there is not one of them in whose honesty
and integrity i
have greater confidence than i have in those of mr
i dislike to appear before the public in this matter but you are at liberty to make such use of this letter as you may think justice requires
yours very truly

central executive committee
your letter of the 7th instant
accompanied by a similar one from the governor elect
the republican state officers
and the republican members of the state board of equalization of ohio
both requesting of me
for publication in permanent form
copies of the political debates between senator douglas and myself last year
has been received
with my grateful acknowledgments to both you and them for the very flattering terms in which the request is communicated
i transmit you the copies
the copies i send you are as reported and printed by the respective friends of senator douglas and myself
at the time that is
his by his friends
and mine by mine
it would be an unwarrantable liberty for us to change a word or a letter in his
and the changes i have made in mine
you perceive
are verbal only
and very few in number
i wish the reprint to be precisely as the copies i send
without any comment whatever

autobiographical sketch to j
december 20
my dear sir
herewith is a little sketch
as you requested
there is not much of it
for the reason
i suppose
that there is not much of me
if anything be made out of it
i wish it to be modest
and not to go beyond the material
if it were thought necessary to incorporate anything from any of my speeches i suppose there would be no objection
of course it must not appear to have been written by myself
yours very truly
lincoln i was born february 12
in hardin county
my parents were both born in virginia
of undistinguished families second families
perhaps i should say
my mother
who died in my tenth year
was of a family of the name of hanks
some of whom now reside in adams
and others in macon county
my paternal grandfather
abraham lincoln
emigrated from rockingham county
to kentucky about 1781 or 1782
where a year or two later he was killed by the indians
not in battle
but by stealth
when he was laboring to open a farm in the forest
his ancestors
who were quakers
went to virginia from berks county
an effort to identify them with the new england family of the same name ended in nothing more definite than a similarity of christian names in both families
such as enoch
and the like
my father
at the death of his father
was but six years of age
and he grew up literally without education
he removed from kentucky to what is now spencer county
in my eighth year
we reached our new home about the time that state came into the union
it was a wild region
with many bears and other wild animals still in the woods
there i grew up
there were some schools
so called
but no qualification was ever required of a teacher beyond readin
and cipherin ' to the rule of three
if a straggler supposed to understand latin happened to sojourn in the neighborhood he was looked upon as a wizard
there was absolutely nothing to excite ambition for education
of course
when i came of age i did not know much
i could read
and cipher to the rule of three
but that was all
i have not been to school since
the little advance i now have upon this store of education i have picked up from time to time under the pressure of necessity
i was raised to farm work
which i continued till i was twenty two
at twenty one i came to illinois
macon county
then i got to new salem
at that time in sangamon
now in menard county
where i remained a year as a sort of clerk in a store
then came the black hawk war and i was elected a captain of volunteers
a success which gave me more pleasure than any i have had since
i went the campaign
was elected
ran for the legislature the same year 1832
and was beaten the only time i ever have been beaten by the people
the next and three succeeding biennial elections i was elected to the legislature
i was not a candidate afterward
during this legislative period i had studied law
and removed to springfield to practice it
in 1846 i was once elected to the lower house of congress
was not a candidate for re election
from 1849 to 1854
both inclusive
practiced law more assiduously than ever before
always a whig in politics and generally on the whig electoral tickets
making active canvasses
i was losing interest in politics when the repeal of the missouri compromise aroused me again
what i have done since then is pretty well known
if any personal description of me is thought desirable
it may be said i am
in height
six feet four inches
nearly lean in flesh
weighing on an average one hundred and eighty pounds dark complexion
with coarse black hair and gray eyes
no other marks or brands recollected
yours truly
on nomination to the national ticket to n
february 9
1859 hon
dear sir
i am not in a position where it would hurt much for me to not be nominated on the national ticket but i am where it would hurt some for me to not get the illinois delegates
what i expected when i wrote the letter to messrs
dole and others is now happening
your discomfited assailants are most bitter against me and they will
for revenge upon me
lay to the bates egg in the south
and to the seward egg in the north
and go far toward squeezing me out in the middle with nothing
can you help me a little in this matter in your end of the vineyard
i mean this to be private
yours as ever
lincoln 1860 speech at the cooper institute
new york february 27
1860 mr
president and fellow citizens of new york
the facts with which i shall deal this evening are mainly old and familiar nor is there anything new in the general use i shall make of them
if there shall be any novelty
it will be in the mode of presenting the facts
and the inferences and observations following that presentation
in his speech last autumn at columbus
as reported in the new york times
senator douglas said
our fathers
when they framed the government under which we live
understood this question just as well
and even better than we do now
i fully indorse this
and i adopt it as a text for this discourse
i so adopt it because it furnishes a precise and an agreed starting point for a discussion between republicans and that wing of the democracy headed by senator douglas
it simply leaves the inquiry
what was the understanding those fathers had of the question mentioned
what is the frame of government under which we live
the answer must be the constitution of the united states
that constitution consists of the original
framed in 1787 and under which the present government first went into operation
and twelve subsequently framed amendments
the first ten of which were framed in 1789
who were our fathers that framed the constitution
i suppose the thirty nine who signed the original instrument may be fairly called our fathers who framed that part of the present government
it is almost exactly true to say they framed it
and it is altogether true to say they fairly represented the opinion and sentiment of the whole nation at that time
their names
being familiar to nearly all
and accessible to quite all
need not now be repeated
i take these thirty nine
for the present
as being our fathers who framed the government under which we live
what is the question which
according to the text
those fathers understood just as well
and even better than we do now
it is this
does the proper division of local from federal authority
or anything in the constitution
forbid our federal government to control as to slavery in our federal territories
upon this senator douglas holds the affirmative
and republicans the negative
this affirmation and denial form an issue
and this issue this question is precisely what the text declares our fathers understood better than we
let us now inquire whether the thirty nine
or any of them
acted upon this question and if they did
how they acted upon it how they expressed that better understanding
in 1784
three years before the constitution the united states then owning the northwestern territory
and no other the congress of the confederation had before them the question of prohibiting slavery in that territory and four of the thirty nine who afterward framed the constitution were in that congress and voted on that question
of these
roger sherman
thomas mifflin
and hugh williamson voted for the prohibition
thus showing that
in their understanding
no line dividing local from federal authority
nor anything else
properly forbade the federal government to control as to slavery in federal territory
the other of the four james mchenry voted against the prohibition
showing that
for some cause
he thought it improper to vote for it
in 1787
still before the constitution
but while the convention was in session framing it
and while the northwestern territory still was the only territory owned by the united states
the same question of prohibiting slavery in the territory again came before the congress of the confederation and two more of the thirty nine who afterward signed the constitution were in that congress
and voted on the question
they were william blount and william few and they both voted for the prohibition thus showing that
in their understanding
no line dividing local from federal authority
nor anything else
properly forbade the federal government to control as to slavery in federal territory
this time the prohibition became a law
being part of what is now well known as the ordinance of '87
the question of federal control of slavery in the territories seems not to have been directly before the convention which framed the original constitution and hence it is not recorded that the thirty nine
or any of them
while engaged on that instrument
expressed any opinion on that precise question
in 1789
by the first congress which sat under the constitution
an act was passed to enforce the ordinance of '87
including the prohibition of slavery in the northwestern territory
the bill for this act was reported by one of the thirty nine
thomas fitzsimmons
then a member of the house of representatives from pennsylvania
it went through all its stages without a word of opposition
and finally passed both branches without yeas and nays
which is equivalent to a unanimous passage
in this congress there were sixteen of the thirty nine fathers who framed the original constitution
they were john langdon
nicholas gilman
roger sherman
robert morris
william few
abraham baldwin
rufus king
william paterson
george claimer
richard bassett
george read
pierce butler
daniel carroll
james madison
this shows that
in their understanding
no line dividing local from federal authority
nor anything in the constitution
properly forbade congress to prohibit slavery in the federal territory else both their fidelity to correct principles and their oath to support the constitution would have constrained them to oppose the prohibition
george washington
another of the thirty nine
was then president of the united states
as such
approved and signed the bill thus completing its validity as a law
and thus showing that
in his understanding
no line dividing local from federal authority
nor anything in the constitution
forbade the federal government to control as to slavery in federal territory
no great while after the adoption of the original constitution
north carolina ceded to the federal government the country now constituting the state of tennessee and
a few years later
georgia ceded that which now constitutes the states of mississippi and alabama
in both deeds of cession it was made a condition by the ceding states that the federal government should not prohibit slavery in the ceded country
besides this
slavery was then actually in the ceded country
under these circumstances
on taking charge of these countries
did not absolutely prohibit slavery within them
but they did interfere with it take control of it even there
to a certain extent
in 1798
congress organized the territory of mississippi
in the act of organization they prohibited the bringing of slaves into the territory from any place without the united states
by fine and giving freedom to slaves so brought
this act passed both branches of congress without yeas and nays
in that congress were three of the thirty nine who framed the original constitution
they were john langdon
george read
and abraham baldwin
they all
voted for it
certainly they would have placed their opposition to it upon record
in their understanding
any line dividing local from federal authority
or anything in the constitution
properly forbade the federal government to control as to slavery in federal territory
in 1803
the federal government purchased the louisiana country
our former territorial acquisitions came from certain of our own states but this louisiana country was acquired from a foreign nation
in 1804
congress gave a territorial organization to that part of it which now constitutes the state of lousiana
new orleans
lying within that part
was an old and comparatively large city
there were other considerable towns and settlements
and slavery was extensively and thoroughly intermingled with the people
congress did not
in the territorial act
prohibit slavery but they did interfere with it take control of it in a more marked and extensive way than they did in the case of mississippi
the substance of the provision therein made in relation to slaves was
that no slave should be imported into the territory from foreign parts
that no slave should be carried into it who had been imported into the united states since the first day of may
that no slave should be carried into it except by the owner
and for his own use as a settler the penalty in all the cases being a fine upon the violator of the law
and freedom to the slave
this act also was passed without yeas and nays
in the congress which passed it there were two of the thirty nine
they were abraham baldwin and jonathan dayton
as stated in the case of mississippi
it is probable they both voted for it
they would not have allowed it to pass without recording their opposition to it
in their understanding
it violated either the line properly dividing local from federal authority
or any provision of the constitution
in 1819 20 came and passed the missouri question
many votes were taken
by yeas and nays
in both branches of congress
upon the various phases of the general question
two of the thirty nine rufus king and charles pinckney were members of that congress
king steadily voted for slavery prohibition and against all compromises
while mr
pinckney as steadily voted against slavery prohibition
and against all compromises
by this
king showed that
in his understanding
no line dividing local from federal authority
nor anything in the constitution
was violated by congress prohibiting slavery in federal territory while mr
by his vote
showed that in his understanding there was some sufficient reason for opposing such prohibition in that case
the cases i have mentioned are the only acts of the thirty nine
or of any of them
upon the direct issue
which i have been able to discover
to enumerate the persons who thus acted
as being four in 1784
two in 1787
seventeen in 1789
three in 1798
two in 1804
and two in 1819 20 there would be thirty of them
but this would be counting
john langdon
roger sherman
william few
rufus king
and george read
each twice
and abraham baldwin three times
the true number of those of the thirty nine whom i have shown to have acted upon the question which
by the text
they understood better than we
is twenty three
leaving sixteen not shown to have acted upon it in any way
we have twenty three out of our thirty nine fathers who framed the government under which we live
who have
upon their official responsibility and their corporal oaths
acted upon the very question which the text affirms they understood just as well
and even better than we do now and twenty one of them a clear majority of the whole thirty nine so acting upon it as to make them guilty of gross political impropriety and wilful perjury
in their understanding
any proper division between local and federal authority
or anything in the constitution they had made themselves
and sworn to support
forbade the federal government to control as to slavery in the federal territories
thus the twenty one acted and
as actions speak louder than words
so actions under such responsibilities speak still louder
two of the twenty three voted against congressional prohibition of slavery in the federal territories
in the instances in which they acted upon the question
but for what reasons they so voted is not known
they may have done so because they thought a proper division of local from federal authority
or some provision or principle of the constitution
stood in the way or they may
without any such question
have voted against the prohibition on what appeared to them to be sufficient grounds of expediency
no one who has sworn to support the constitution can conscientiously vote for what he understands to be an unconstitutional measure
however expedient he may think it but one may and ought to vote against a measure which he deems constitutional
at the same time
he deems it inexpedient
it therefore would be unsafe to set down even the two who voted against the prohibition as having done so because
in their understanding
any proper division of local from federal authority
or anything in the constitution
forbade the federal government to control as to slavery in federal territory
the remaining sixteen of the thirty nine
so far as i have discovered
have left no record of their understanding upon the direct question of federal control on slavery in the federal territories
but there is much reason to believe that their understanding upon that question would not have appeared different from that of their twenty three compeers
had it been manifested at all
for the purpose of adhering rigidly to the text
i have purposely omitted whatever understanding may have been manifested by any person
however distinguished
other than the thirty nine fathers who framed the original constitution and
for the same reason
i have also omitted whatever understanding may have been manifested by any of the thirty tine even on any other phase of the general question of slavery
if we should look into their acts and declarations on those other phases
as the foreign slave trade
and the morality and policy of slavery generally
it would appear to us that on the direct question of federal control of slavery in federal territories
the sixteen
if they had acted at all
would probably have acted just as the twenty three did
among that sixteen were several of the most noted anti slavery men of those times as dr
alexander hamilton
and gouverneur morris while there was not one now known to have been otherwise
unless it may be john rutledge
of south carolina
the sum of the whole is
that of our thirty nine fathers who framed the original constitution
twenty one a clear majority of the whole certainly understood that no proper division of local from federal authority
nor any part of the constitution
forbade the federal government to control slavery in the federal territories whilst all the rest probably had the same understanding
was the understanding of our fathers who framed the original constitution and the text affirms that they understood the question better than we
but
so far
i have been considering the understanding of the question manifested by the framers of the original constitution
in and by the original instrument
a mode was provided for amending it and
as i have already stated
the present frame of the government under which we live consists of that original
and twelve amendatory articles framed and adopted since
those who now insist that federal control of slavery in federal territories violates the constitution
point us to the provisions which they suppose it thus violates and
as i understand
they all fix upon provisions in these amendatory articles
and not in the original instrument
the supreme court
in the dred scott case
plant themselves upon the fifth amendment
which provides that no person shall be deprived of life
or property without due process of law while senator douglas and his peculiar adherents plant themselves upon the tenth amendment
providing that the powers not delegated to the united states by the constitution are reserved to the states respectively
or to the people
now
it so happens that these amendments were framed by the first congress which sat under the constitution the identical congress which passed the act already mentioned
enforcing the prohibition of slavery in the northwestern territory
not only was it the same congress
but they were the identical same individual men who
at the same session
and at the same time within the session
had under consideration
and in progress toward maturity
these constitutional amendments
and this act prohibiting slavery in all the territory the nation then owned
the constitutional amendments were introduced before and passed after the act enforcing the ordinance of '87 so that
during the whole pendency of the act to enforce the ordinance
the constitutional amendments were also pending
the seventy six members of that congress
including sixteen of the framers of the original constitution
as before stated
were pre eminently our fathers who framed that part of the government under which we live
which is now claimed as forbidding the federal government to control slavery in the federal territories
is it not a little presumptuous in any one at this day to affirm that the two things which that congress deliberately framed
and carried to maturity at the same time
are absolutely inconsistent with each other
and does not such affirmation become impudently absurd when coupled with the other affirmation from the same mouth
that those who did the two things alleged to be inconsistent understood whether they really were inconsistent better than we better than he who affirms that they are inconsistent
it is surely safe to assume that the thirty nine framers of the original constitution
and the seventy six members of the congress which framed the amendments thereto
taken together
do certainly include those who may be fairly called our fathers who framed the government under which we live
and
so assuming
i defy any man to show that any one of them ever
in his whole life
declared that
in his understanding
any proper division of local from federal authority
or any part of the constitution
forbade the federal government to control as to slavery in the federal territories
i go a step further
i defy any one to show that any living man in the world ever did
prior to the beginning of the present century and i might almost say prior to the beginning of the last half of the present century
declare that
in his understanding
any proper division of local from federal authority
or any part of the constitution
forbade the federal government to control as to slavery in the federal territories
to those who now so declare
i give not only our fathers who framed the government under which we live
but with them all other living men within the century in which it was framed
among whom to search
and they shall not be able to find the evidence of a single man agreeing with them
now and here let me guard a little against being misunderstood
i do not mean to say we are bound to follow implicitly in whatever our fathers did
to do so would be to discard all the lights of current experience to reject all progress
all improvement
what i do say is that
if we would supplant the opinions and policy of our fathers in any case
we should do so upon evidence so conclusive
and argument so clear
that even their great authority
fairly considered and weighed
cannot stand and most surely not in a case whereof we ourselves declare they understood the question better than we
if any man at this day sincerely believes that proper division of local from federal authority
or any part of the constitution
forbids the federal government to control as to slavery in the federal territories
he is right to say so
and to enforce his position by all truthful evidence and fair argument which he can
but he has no right to mislead others who have less access to history
and less leisure to study it
into the false belief that our fathers who framed the government under which we live were of the same opinion thus substituting falsehood and deception for truthful evidence and fair argument
if any man at this day sincerely believes our fathers
who framed the government under which we live
used and applied principles
in other cases
which ought to have led them to understand that a proper division of local from federal authority
or some part of the constitution
forbids the federal government to control as to slavery in the federal territories
he is right to say so
but he should
at the same time
brave the responsibility of declaring that
in his opinion
he understands their principles better than they did themselves and especially should he not shirk that responsibility by asserting that they understood the question just as well
and even better than we do now
but enough
let all who believe that our fathers
who framed the government under which we live
understood this question just as well
and even better than we do now
speak as they spoke
and act as they acted upon it
this is all republicans ask all republicans desire in relation to slavery
as those fathers marked it
so let it be again marked
as an evil not to be extended
but to be tolerated and protected only because of
and so far as
its actual presence among us makes that toleration and protection a necessity
let all the guaranties those fathers gave it be not grudgingly
but fully and fairly maintained
for this republicans contend
and with this
so far as i know or believe
they will be content
and now
if they would listen as i suppose they will not i would address a few words to the southern people
i would say to them
you consider yourselves a reasonable and a just people and i consider that in the general qualities of reason and justice you are not inferior to any other people
when you speak of us republicans
you do so only to denounce us as reptiles
at the best
as no better than outlaws
you will grant a hearing to pirates or murderers
but nothing like it to black republicans
in all your contentions with one another
each of you deems an unconditional condemnation of black republicanism as the first thing to be attended to
such condemnation of us seems to be an indispensable prerequisite license
so to speak among you
to be admitted or permitted to speak at all
now can you
or not
be prevailed upon to pause
and to consider whether this is quite just to us
or even to yourselves
bring forward your charges and specifications
and then be patient long enough to hear us deny or justify
you say we are sectional
we deny it
that makes an issue and the burden of proof is upon you
you produce your proof and what is it
that our party has no existence in your section gets no votes in your section
the fact is substantially true but does it prove the issue
if it does
then in case we should
without change of principle
begin to get votes in your section
we should thereby cease to be sectional
you cannot escape this conclusion and yet
are you willing to abide by it
if you are
you will probably soon find that we have ceased to be sectional
for we shall get votes in your section this very year
you will then begin to discover
as the truth plainly is
that your proof
does not touch the issue
the fact that we get no votes in your section is a fact of your making
and not of ours
and if there be fault in that fact
that fault is primarily yours
and remains so until you show that we repel you by
some wrong principle or practice
if we do repel you by any wrong principle or practice
the fault is ours but this brings you to where you ought to have started to a discussion of the right or wrong of our principle
if our principle
put in practice
would wrong your section for the benefit of ours
or for any other object
then our principle
and we with it
are sectional
and are justly opposed and denounced as such
meet us
on the question of whether our principle
put in practice
would wrong your section and so meet us as if it were possible that something may be said on our side
do you accept the challenge
then you really believe that the principle which our fathers who framed the government under which we live thought so clearly right as to adopt it
and indorse it again and again
upon their official oaths
is in fact so clearly wrong as to demand your condemnation without a moment's consideration
some of you delight to flaunt in our faces the warning against sectional parties given by washington in his farewell address
less than eight years before washington gave that warning
he had
as president of the united states
approved and signed an act of congress enforcing the prohibition of slavery in the northwestern territory
which act embodied the policy of the government upon that subject up to
and at
the very moment he penned that warning and about one year after he penned it
he wrote la fayette that he considered that prohibition a wise measure
expressing in the same connection his hope that we should at some time have a confederacy of free states
bearing this in mind
and seeing that sectionalism has since arisen upon this same subject
is that warning a weapon in your hands against us
or in our hands against you
could washington himself speak
would he cast the blame of that sectionalism upon us
who sustain his policy
or upon you
who repudiate it
we respect that warning of washington
and we commend it to you
together with his example pointing to the right application of it
but you say you are conservative eminently conservative while we are revolutionary
or something
of the sort
what is conservatism
is it not adherence to the old and tried
against a new and untried
we stick to
contend for
the identical old policy on the point in controversy which was adopted by our fathers who framed the government under which we live while you with one accord reject
and scout
and spit upon that old policy and insist upon substituting something new
you disagree among yourselves as to what that substitute shall be
you are divided on new propositions and plans
but you are unanimous in rejecting and denouncing the old policy of the fathers
some of you are for reviving the foreign slave trade some for a congressional slave code for the territories some for congress forbidding the territories to prohibit slavery within their limits some for maintaining slavery in the territories through the judiciary some for the gur reat pur rinciple that if one man would enslave another
no third man should object
fantastically called popular sovereignty but never a man among you in favor of federal prohibition of slavery in federal territories
according to the practice of our fathers who framed the government under which we live
not one of all your various plans can show a precedent or an advocate in the century within which our government originated
whether your claim of conservatism for yourselves
and your charge of destructiveness against us
are based on the most clear and stable foundations
you say we have made the slavery question more prominent than it formerly was
we deny it
we admit that it is more prominent
but we deny that we made it so
it was not we
but you
who discarded the old policy of the fathers
we resisted and still resist your innovation and thence comes the greater prominence of the question
would you have that question reduced to its former proportions
go back to that old policy
what has been will be again
under the same conditions
if you would have the peace of the old times
readopt the precepts and policy of the old times
you charge that we stir up insurrections among your slaves
we deny it and what is your proof
harper's ferry
john brown
john brown was no republican and you have failed to implicate a single republican in his harper's ferry enterprise
if any member of our party is guilty in that matter you know it or you do not know it
if you do know it
you are inexcusable for not designating the man and proving the fact
if you do not know it
you are inexcusable for asserting it
and especially for persisting in the assertion after you have tried and failed to make the proof
you need not be told that persisting in a charge which one does not know to be true is simply malicious slander
some of you admit that no republican designedly aided or encouraged the harper's ferry affair
but still insist that our doctrines and declarations necessarily lead to such results
we do not believe it
we know we hold to no doctrine
and make no declaration
which were not held to and made by our fathers who framed the government under which we live
you never dealt fairly by us in relation to this affair
when it occurred
some important state elections were near at hand
and you were in evident glee with the belief that
by charging the blame upon us
you could get an advantage of us in those elections
the elections came
and your expectations were not quite fulfilled
every republican man knew that
as to himself at least
your charge was a slander
and he was not much inclined by it to cast his vote in your favor
republican doctrines and declarations are accompanied with a continued protest against any interference whatever with your slaves
or with you about your slaves
this does not encourage them to revolt
we do
in common with our fathers
who framed the government under which we live
declare our belief that slavery is wrong but the slaves do not hear us declare even this
for any thing we say or do
the slaves would scarcely know there is a republican party
i believe they would not
in fact
generally know it but for your misrepresentations of us in their hearing
in your political contests among yourselves
each faction charges the other with sympathy with black republicanism and then
to give point to the charge
defines black republicanism to simply be insurrection
and thunder among the slaves
slave insurrections are no more common now than they were before the republican party was organized
what induced the southampton insurrection
twenty eight years ago
in which
at least
three times as many lives were lost as at harper's ferry
you can scarcely stretch your very elastic fancy to the conclusion that southampton was got up by black republicanism
in the present state of things in the united states
i do not think a general or even a very extensive slave insurrection is possible
the indispensable concert of action cannot be attained
the slaves have no means of rapid communication nor can incendiary freemen
black or white
supply it
the explosive materials are everywhere in parcels but there neither are
nor can be supplied the indispensable connecting trains
much is said by southern people about the affection of slaves for their masters and mistresses and a part of it
at least
is true
a plot for an uprising could scarcely be devised and communicated to twenty individuals before some one of them
to save the life of a favorite master or mistress
would divulge it
this is the rule and the slave revolution in hayti was not an exception to it
but a case occurring under peculiar circumstances
the gunpowder plot of british history
though not connected with slaves
was more in point
in that case
only about twenty were admitted to the secret and yet one of them
in his anxiety to save a friend
betrayed the plot to that friend
by consequence
averted the calamity
occasional poisonings from the kitchen
and open or stealthy assassinations in the field
and local revolts
extending to a score or so
will continue to occur as the natural results of slavery but no general insurrection of slaves
as i think
can happen in this country for a long time
whoever much fears or much hopes for such an event will be alike disappointed
in the language of mr
uttered many years ago
it is still in our power to direct the process of emancipation and deportation peaceably
and in such slow degrees as that the evil will wear off insensibly
and their places be
pari passu
filled up by free white laborers
on the contrary
it is left to force itself on
human nature must shudder at the prospect held up
mr
jefferson did not mean to say
nor do i
that the power of emancipation is in the federal government
he spoke of virginia and
as to the power of emancipation
i speak of the slave holding states only
the federal government
as we insist
has the power of restraining the extension of the institution the power to insure that a slave insurrection shall never occur on any american soil which is now free from slavery
john brown's effort was peculiar
it was not a slave insurrection
it was an attempt by white men to get up a revolt among slaves
in which the slaves refused to participate
in fact
it was so absurd that the slaves
with all their ignorance
saw plainly enough it could not succeed
that affair
in its philosophy
corresponds with the many attempts related in history at the assassination of kings and emperors
an enthusiast broods over the oppression of a people till he fancies himself commissioned by heaven to liberate them
he ventures the attempt
which ends in little else than his own execution
orsini's attempt on louis napoleon and john brown's attempt at harper's ferry were
in their philosophy
precisely the same
the eagerness to cast blame on old england in the one case
and on new england in the other
does not disprove the sameness of the two things
and how much would it avail you
if you could
by the use of john brown
helper's book
and the like
break up the republican organization
human action can be modified to some extent
but human nature cannot be changed
there is a judgment and a feeling against slavery in this nation
which cast at least a million and a half of votes
you cannot destroy that judgment and feeling that sentiment by breaking up the political organization which rallies around it
you can scarcely scatter and disperse an army which has been formed into order in the face of your heaviest fire but if you could
how much would you gain by forcing the sentiment which created it out of the peaceful channel of the ballot box
into some other channel
what would that other channel probably be
would the number of john browns be lessened or enlarged by the operation
but you will break up the union rather than submit to a denial of your constitutional rights
that has a somewhat reckless sound but it would be palliated
if not fully justified
were we proposing
by the mere force of numbers
to deprive you of some right plainly written down in the constitution
but we are proposing no such thing
when you make these declarations
you have a specific and well understood allusion to an assumed constitutional right of yours to take slaves into the federal territories
and to hold them there as property
but no such right is specifically written in the constitution
that instrument is literally silent about any such right
on the contrary
deny that such a right has any existence in the constitution
even by implication
your purpose
plainly stated
is that you will destroy the government unless you be allowed to construe and enforce the constitution as you please on all points in dispute between you and us
you will rule or ruin
in all events
plainly stated
is your language
perhaps you will say the supreme court has decided the disputed constitutional question in your favor
not quite so
waiving the lawyer's distinction between dictum and decision
the court have decided the question for you in a sort of way
the court have substantially said it is your constitutional right to take slaves into the federal territories
and to hold them there as property
when i say
the decision was made in a sort of way
i mean it was made in a divided court
by a bare majority of the judges
and they not quite agreeing with one another in the reasons for making it that it is so made as that its avowed supporters disagree with one another about its meaning
and that it was mainly based upon a mistaken statement of fact the statement in the opinion that the right of property in a slave is distinctly and expressly affirmed in the constitution
an inspection of the constitution will show that the right of property in a slave is not distinctly and expressly affirmed in it
bear in mind
the judges do not pledge their judicial opinion that such right is impliedly affirmed in the constitution but they pledge their veracity that it is distinctly and expressly affirmed there distinctly
that is
not mingled with anything else expressly
that is
in words meaning just that
without the aid of any inference
and susceptible of no other meaning
if they had only pledged their judicial opinion that such right is affirmed in the instrument by implication
it would be open to others to show that neither the word slave nor slavery is to be found in the constitution
nor the word property even
in any connection with language alluding to the things slave or slavery and that wherever in that instrument the slave is alluded to
he is called a person and wherever his master's legal right in relation to him is alluded to
it is spoken of as service or labor which may be due
as a debt payable in service or labor
it would be open to show
by contemporaneous history
that this mode of alluding to slaves and slavery
instead of speaking of them
was employed on purpose to exclude from the constitution the idea that there could be property in man
to show all this
is easy and certain
when this obvious mistake of the judges shall be brought to their notice
is it not reasonable to expect that they will withdraw the mistaken statement
and reconsider the conclusion based upon it
and then it is to be remembered that our fathers who framed the government under which we live
the men who made the constitution decided this same constitutional question in our favor
long ago decided it without division among themselves
when making the decision
without division among themselves about the meaning of it after it was made
so far as any evidence is left
without basing it upon any mistaken statement of facts
under all these circumstances
do you really feel yourselves justified to break up this government unless such a court decision as yours is shall be at once submitted to as a conclusive and final rule of political action
but you will not abide the election of a republican president
in that supposed event
you say
you will destroy the union and then
you say
the great crime of having destroyed it will be upon us
that is cool
a highwayman holds a pistol to my ear
and mutters through his teeth
stand and deliver
or i shall kill you
and then you'll be a murderer
to be sure
what the robber demanded of me my money was my own
and i had a clear right to keep it but it was no more my own than my vote is my own and the threat of death to me
to extort my money
and the threat of destruction to the union
to extort my vote
can scarcely be distinguished in principle
a few words now to republicans
it is exceedingly desirable that all parts of this great confederacy shall be at peace and in harmony one with another
let us republicans do our part to have it so
even though much provoked
let us do nothing through passion and ill temper
even though the southern people will not so much as listen to us
let us calmly consider their demands
and yield to them if
in our deliberate view of our duty
we possibly can
judging by all they say and do
and by the subject and nature of their controversy with us
let us determine
if we can
what will satisfy them
will they be satisfied if the territories be unconditionally surrendered to them
we know they will not
in all their present complaints against us
the territories are scarcely mentioned
invasions and insurrections are the rage now
will it satisfy them if
in the future
we have nothing to do with invasions and
we know it will not
we so know because we know we never had anything to do with invasions and insurrections and yet this total abstaining does not exempt us from the charge and the denunciation
the question recurs
what will satisfy them
simply this
we must not only let them alone
but we must
convince them that we do let them alone
we know by experience
is no easy task
we have been so trying to convince them from the very beginning of our organization
but with no success
in all our platforms and speeches we have constantly protested our purpose to let them alone but this has had no tendency to convince them
alike unavailing to convince them is the fact that they have never detected a man of us in any attempt to disturb them
these natural and apparently adequate means all failing
what will convince them
and this only
cease to call slavery wrong
and join them in calling it right
and this must be done thoroughly done in acts as well as in words
silence will not be tolerated we must place ourselves avowedly with them
senator douglas's new sedition law must be enacted and enforced
suppressing all declarations that slavery is wrong
whether made in politics
in presses
in pulpits or in private
we must arrest and return their fugitive slaves with greedy pleasure
we must pull down our free state constitutions
the whole atmosphere must be disinfected from all taint of opposition to slavery
before they will cease to believe that all their troubles proceed from us
i am quite aware they do not state their case precisely in this way
most of them would probably say to us
let us alone
do nothing to us
and say what you please about slavery
but we do let them alone have never disturbed them so that after all it is what we say which dissatisfies them
they will continue to accuse us of doing
until we cease saying
i am also aware they have not as yet
in terms
demanded the overthrow of our free state constitutions
yet those constitutions declare the wrong of slavery
with more solemn emphasis than do all other sayings against it and when all these other sayings shall have been silenced
the overthrow of these constitutions will be demanded
and nothing be left to resist the demand
it is nothing to the contrary
that they do not demand the whole of this just now
demanding what they do
and for the reason they do
they can voluntarily stop nowhere short of this consummation
as they do
that slavery is morally right
and socially elevating
they cannot cease to demand a full national recognition of it
as a legal right and a social blessing
nor can we justifiably withhold this on any ground save our conviction that slavery is wrong
if slavery is right
all words
and constitutions against it are themselves wrong
and should be silenced and swept away
if it is right
we cannot justly object to its nationality its universality if it is wrong
they cannot justly insist upon its extension its enlargement
all they ask we could readily grant if we thought slavery right all we ask they could as readily grant
if they thought it wrong
their thinking it right and our thinking it wrong is the precise fact upon which depends the whole controversy
thinking it right
as they do
they are not to blame for desiring its full recognition
as being right but thinking it wrong
as we do
can we yield to them
can we cast our votes with their view
and against our own
in view of our moral
and political responsibilities
can we do this
wrong as we think slavery is
we can yet afford to let it alone where it is
because that much is due to the necessity arising from its actual presence in the nation but can we
while our votes will prevent it
allow it to spread into the national territories
and to overrun us here in these free states
if our sense of duty forbids this
then let us stand by our duty
fearlessly and effectively
let us be diverted by none of those sophistical contrivances wherewith we are so industriously plied and belabored contrivances such as groping for some middle ground between the right and the wrong
vain as the search for a man who should be neither a living man nor a dead man such as a policy of don't care on a question about which all true men do care such as union appeals beseeching true union men to yield to disunionists
reversing the divine rule
and calling
not the sinners
but the righteous to repentance such as invocations to washington
imploring men to unsay what washington said
and undo what washington did
neither let us be slandered from our duty by false accusations against us
nor frightened from it by menaces of destruction to the government nor of dungeons to ourselves
let us have faith that right makes might
and in that faith let us
to the end
dare to do our duty as we understand it
speech at new haven
march 6
1860 mr
and fellow citizens of new haven
if the republican party of this nation shall ever have the national house entrusted to its keeping
it will be the duty of that party to attend to all the affairs of national housekeeping
whatever matters of importance may come up
whatever difficulties may arise in its way of administration of the government
that party will then have to attend to
it will then be compelled to attend to other questions
besides this question which now assumes an overwhelming importance the question of slavery
it is true that in the organization of the republican party this question of slavery was more important than any other
so much more important has it become that no more national question can even get a hearing just at present
the old question of tariff a matter that will remain one of the chief affairs of national house keeping to all time the question of the management of financial affairs the question of the disposition of the public domain how shall it be managed for the purpose of getting it well settled
and of making there the homes of a free and happy people
these will remain open and require attention for a great while yet
and these questions will have to be attended to by whatever party has the control of the government
just now
they cannot even obtain a hearing
and i do not propose to detain you upon these topics or what sort of hearing they should have when opportunity shall come
whether we will or not
the question of slavery is the question
the all absorbing topic of the day
it is true that all of us and by that i mean
not the republican party alone
but the whole american people
here and elsewhere all of us wish this question settled
wish it out of the way
it stands in the way
and prevents the adjustment
and the giving of necessary attention to other questions of national house keeping
the people of the whole nation agree that this question ought to be settled
and yet it is not settled
and the reason is that they are not yet agreed how it shall be settled
all wish it done
but some wish one way and some another
and some a third
or fourth
or fifth different bodies are pulling in different directions
and none of them
having a decided majority
are able to accomplish the common object
in the beginning of the year 1854
a new policy was inaugurated with the avowed object and confident promise that it would entirely and forever put an end to the slavery agitation
it was again and again declared that under this policy
when once successfully established
the country would be forever rid of this whole question
yet under the operation of that policy this agitation has not only not ceased
but it has been constantly augmented
and this too
from the day of its introduction
its friends
who promised that it would wholly end all agitation
constantly insisted
down to the time that the lecompton bill was introduced
that it was working admirably
and that its inevitable tendency was to remove the question forever from the politics of the country
can you call to mind any democratic speech
made after the repeal of the missouri compromise
down to the time of the lecompton bill
in which it was not predicted that the slavery agitation was just at an end
that the abolition excitement was played out
the kansas question was dead
they have made the most they can out of this question and it is now forever settled
but since the lecompton bill no democrat
within my experience
has ever pretended that he could see the end
that cry has been dropped
they themselves do not pretend
that the agitation of this subject has come to an end yet
the truth is that this question is one of national importance
and we cannot help dealing with it we must do something about it
whether we will or not
we cannot avoid it the subject is one we cannot avoid considering we can no more avoid it than a man can live without eating
it is upon us it attaches to the body politic as much and closely as the natural wants attach to our natural bodies
now i think it important that this matter should be taken up in earnest
and really settled
and one way to bring about a true settlement of the question is to understand its true magnitude
there have been many efforts made to settle it
again and again it has been fondly hoped that it was settled but every time it breaks out afresh
and more violently than ever
it was settled
our fathers hoped
by the missouri compromise
but it did not stay settled
then the compromises of 1850 were declared to be a full and final settlement of the question
the two great parties
each in national convention
adopted resolutions declaring that the settlement made by the compromise of 1850 was a finality that it would last forever
yet how long before it was unsettled again
it broke out again in 1854
and blazed higher and raged more furiously than ever before
and the agitation has not rested since
these repeated settlements must have some faults about them
there must be some inadequacy in their very nature to the purpose to which they were designed
we can only speculate as to where that fault
that inadequacy
but we may perhaps profit by past experiences
i think that one of the causes of these repeated failures is that our best and greatest men have greatly underestimated the size of this question
they have constantly brought forward small cures for great sores plasters too small to cover the wound
that is one reason that all settlements have proved temporary so evanescent
look at the magnitude of this subject
one sixth of our population
in round numbers not quite one sixth
and yet more than a seventh
about one sixth of the whole population of the united states are slaves
the owners of these slaves consider them property
the effect upon the minds of the owners is that of property
and nothing else it induces them to insist upon all that will favorably affect its value as property
to demand laws and institutions and a public policy that shall increase and secure its value
and make it durable
and universal
the effect on the minds of the owners is to persuade them that there is no wrong in it
the slaveholder does not like to be considered a mean fellow for holding that species of property
and hence
he has to struggle within himself and sets about arguing himself into the belief that slavery is right
the property influences his mind
the dissenting minister who argued some theological point with one of the established church was always met with the reply
i can't see it so
he opened a bible and pointed him a passage
but the orthodox minister replied
i can't see it so
then he showed him a single word can you see that
yes
i see it
was the reply
the dissenter laid a guinea over the word and asked
do you see it now
so here
whether the owners of this species of property do really see it as it is
it is not for me to say
but if they do
they see it as it is through two thousand millions of dollars
and that is a pretty thick coating
certain it is that they do not see it as we see it
certain it is that this two thousand millions of dollars
invested in this species of property
all so concentrated that the mind can grasp it at once this immense pecuniary interest has its influence upon their minds
but here in connecticut and at the north slavery does not exist
and we see it through no such medium
to us it appears natural to think that slaves are human beings men
not property that some of the things
at least
stated about men in the declaration of independence apply to them as well as to us
i say we think
most of us
that this charter of freedom applies to the slaves as well as to ourselves that the class of arguments put forward to batter down that idea are also calculated to break down the very idea of a free government
even for white men
and to undermine the very foundations of free society
we think slavery a great moral wrong
while we do not claim the right to touch it where it exists
we wish to treat it as a wrong in the territories
where our votes will reach it
we think that a respect for ourselves
a regard for future generations and for the god that made us
require that we put down this wrong where our votes will properly reach it
we think that species of labor an injury to free white men in short
we think slavery a great moral
and political evil
tolerable only because
and so far as
its actual existence makes it necessary to tolerate it
and that beyond that it ought to be treated as a wrong
now these two ideas
the property idea that slavery is right
and the idea that it is wrong
come into collision
and do actually produce that irrepressible conflict which mr
seward has been so roundly abused for mentioning
the two ideas conflict
and must conflict
in its political aspect
does anything in any way endanger the perpetuity of this union but that single thing
many of our adversaries are anxious to claim that they are specially devoted to the union
and take pains to charge upon us hostility to the union
now we claim that we are the only true union men
and we put to them this one proposition
whatever endangers this union
save and except slavery
did any other thing ever cause a moment's fear
all men must agree that this thing alone has ever endangered the perpetuity of the union
but if it was threatened by any other influence
would not all men say that the best thing that could be done
if we could not or ought not to destroy it
would be at least to keep it from growing any larger
can any man believe
that the way to save the union is to extend and increase the only thing that threatens the union
and to suffer it to grow bigger and bigger
whenever this question shall be settled
it must be settled on some philosophical basis
no policy that does not rest upon some philosophical opinion can be permanently maintained
and hence there are but two policies in regard to slavery that can be at all maintained
the first
based on the property view that slavery is right
conforms to that idea throughout
and demands that we shall do everything for it that we ought to do if it were right
we must sweep away all opposition
for opposition to the right is wrong we must agree that slavery is right
and we must adopt the idea that property has persuaded the owner to believe that slavery is morally right and socially elevating
this gives a philosophical basis for a permanent policy of encouragement
the other policy is one that squares with the idea that slavery is wrong
and it consists in doing everything that we ought to do if it is wrong
i don't wish to be misunderstood
nor to leave a gap down to be misrepresented
i don't mean that we ought to attack it where it exists
to me it seems that if we were to form a government anew
in view of the actual presence of slavery we should find it necessary to frame just such a government as our fathers did giving to the slaveholder the entire control where the system was established
while we possessed the power to restrain it from going outside those limits
from the necessities of the case we should be compelled to form just such a government as our blessed fathers gave us and
if they have so made it
that adds another reason why we should let slavery alone where it exists
if i saw a venomous snake crawling in the road
any man would say i might seize the nearest stick and kill it but if i found that snake in bed with my children
that would be another question
i might hurt the children more than the snake
and it might bite them
much more if i found it in bed with my neighbor's children
and i had bound myself by a solemn compact not to meddle with his children under any circumstances
it would become me to let that particular mode of getting rid of the gentleman alone
but if there was a bed newly made up
to which the children were to be taken
and it was proposed to take a batch of young snakes and put them there with them
i take it no man would say there was any question how i ought to decide
that is just the case
the new territories are the newly made bed to which our children are to go
and it lies with the nation to say whether they shall have snakes mixed up with them or not
it does not seem as if there could be much hesitation what our policy should be
now i have spoken of a policy based on the idea that slavery is wrong
and a policy based on the idea that it is right
but an effort has been made for a policy that shall treat it as neither right nor wrong
it is based upon utter indifference
its leading advocate douglas has said
i don't care whether it be voted up or down
it is merely a matter of dollars and cents
the almighty has drawn a line across this continent
on one side of which all soil must forever be cultivated by slave labor
and on the other by free
when the struggle is between the white man and the negro
i am for the white man when it is between the negro and the crocodile
i am for the negro
its central idea is indifference
it holds that it makes no more difference to us whether the territories become free or slave states than whether my neighbor stocks his farm with horned cattle or puts in tobacco
all recognize this policy
the plausible sugar coated name of which is popular sovereignty
this policy chiefly stands in the way of a permanent settlement of the question
i believe there is no danger of its becoming the permanent policy of the country
for it is based on a public indifference
there is nobody that don't care
all the people do care one way or the other
i do not charge that its author
when he says he don't care
states his individual opinion he only expresses his policy for the government
i understand that he has never said as an individual whether he thought slavery right or wrong and he is the only man in the nation that has not
now such a policy may have a temporary run it may spring up as necessary to the political prospects of some gentleman but it is utterly baseless
the people are not indifferent
and it can therefore have no durability or permanence
but suppose it could
then it could be maintained only by a public opinion that shall say
we don't care
there must be a change in public opinion the public mind must be so far debauched as to square with this policy of caring not at all
the people must come to consider this as merely a question of dollars and cents
and to believe that in some places the almighty has made slavery necessarily eternal
this policy can be brought to prevail if the people can be brought round to say honestly
we don't care if not
it can never be maintained
it is for you to say whether that can be done
you are ready to say it cannot
but be not too fast
remember what a long stride has been taken since the repeal of the missouri compromise
do you know of any democrat
of either branch of the party do you know one who declares that he believes that the declaration of independence has any application to the negro
judge taney declares that it has not
and judge douglas even vilifies me personally and scolds me roundly for saying that the declaration applies to all men
and that negroes are men
is there a democrat here who does not deny that the declaration applies to the negro
do any of you know of one
i have tried before perhaps fifty audiences
some larger and some smaller than this
to find one such democrat
and never yet have i found one who said i did not place him right in that
i must assume that democrats hold that
and now
not one of these democrats can show that he said that five years ago
i venture to defy the whole party to produce one man that ever uttered the belief that the declaration did not apply to negroes
before the repeal of the missouri compromise
four or five years ago we all thought negroes were men
and that when all men were named
negroes were included
but the whole democratic party has deliberately taken negroes from the class of men and put them in the class of brutes
turn it as you will it is simply the truth
don't be too hasty
in saying that the people cannot be brought to this new doctrine
but note that long stride
one more as long completes the journey from where negroes are estimated as men to where they are estimated as mere brutes as rightful property
that saying in the struggle between white men and the negro
etc
which i know came from the same source as this policy that saying marks another step
there is a falsehood wrapped up in that statement
in the struggle between the white man and the negro assumes that there is a struggle
in which either the white man must enslave the negro or the negro must enslave the white
there is no such struggle
it is merely the ingenious falsehood to degrade and brutalize the negro
let each let the other alone
and there is no struggle about it
if it was like two wrecked seamen on a narrow plank
when each must push the other off or drown himself
i would push the negro off or a white man either
but it is not the plank is large enough for both
this good earth is plenty broad enough for white man and negro both
and there is no need of either pushing the other off
so that saying
in the struggle between the negro and the crocodile
etc
is made up from the idea that down where the crocodile inhabits
a white man can't labor it must be nothing else but crocodile or negro if the negro does not the crocodile must possess the earth in that case he declares for the negro
the meaning of the whole is just this
as a white man is to a negro
so is a negro to a crocodile and as the negro may rightfully treat the crocodile
so may the white man rightfully treat the negro
this very dear phrase coined by its author
and so dear that he deliberately repeats it in many speeches
has a tendency to still further brutalize the negro
and to bring public opinion to the point of utter indifference whether men so brutalized are enslaved or not
when that time shall come
if ever
i think that policy to which i refer may prevail
but i hope the good freemen of this country will never allow it to come
and until then the policy can never be maintained
now consider the effect of this policy
we in the states are not to care whether freedom or slavery gets the better
but the people in the territories may care
they are to decide
and they may think what they please it is a matter of dollars and cents
but are not the people of the territories detailed from the states
if this feeling of indifference this absence of moral sense about the question prevails in the states
will it not be carried into the territories
will not every man say
i don't care
it is nothing to me
if any one comes that wants slavery
must they not say
i don't care whether freedom or slavery be voted up or voted down
it results at last in nationalizing the institution of slavery
even if fairly carried out
that policy is just as certain to nationalize slavery as the doctrine of jeff davis himself
these are only two roads to the same goal
and popular sovereignty is just as sure and almost as short as the other
what we want
and all we want
is to have with us the men who think slavery wrong
but those who say they hate slavery
and are opposed to it
but yet act with the democratic party where are they
let us apply a few tests
you say that you think slavery is wrong
but you denounce all attempts to restrain it
is there anything else that you think wrong that you are not willing to deal with as wrong
why are you so careful
so tender
of this one wrong and no other
you will not let us do a single thing as if it was wrong there is no place where you will even allow it to be called wrong
we must not call it wrong in the free states
because it is not there
and we must not call it wrong in the slave states
because it is there we must not call it wrong in politics because that is bringing morality into politics
and we must not call it wrong in the pulpit because that is bringing politics into religion we must not bring it into the tract society or the other societies
because those are such unsuitable places and there is no single place
according to you
where this wrong thing can properly be called wrong
perhaps you will plead that if the people of the slave states should themselves set on foot an effort for emancipation
you would wish them success
and bid them god speed
let us test that
in 1858 the emancipation party of missouri
with frank blair at their head
tried to get up a movement for that purpose
and having started a party contested the state
blair was beaten
apparently if not truly
and when the news came to connecticut
who knew that frank blair was taking hold of this thing by the right end
and doing the only thing that you say can properly be done to remove this wrong did you bow your heads in sorrow because of that defeat
do you
any of you
know one single democrat that showed sorrow over that result
not one
on the contrary every man threw up his hat
and hallooed at the top of his lungs
hooray for democracy
now
the republicans desire to place this great question of slavery on the very basis on which our fathers placed it
and no other
it is easy to demonstrate that our fathers
who framed this government under which we live
looked on slavery as wrong
and so framed it and everything about it as to square with the idea that it was wrong
so far as the necessities arising from its existence permitted
in forming the constitution they found the slave trade existing
capital invested in it
fields depending upon it for labor
and the whole system resting upon the importation of slave labor
they therefore did not prohibit the slave trade at once
but they gave the power to prohibit it after twenty years
why was this
what other foreign trade did they treat in that way
would they have done this if they had not thought slavery wrong
another thing was done by some of the same men who framed the constitution
and afterwards adopted as their own the act by the first congress held under that constitution
of which many of the framers were members
that prohibited the spread of slavery into territories
thus the same men
the framers of the constitution
cut off the supply and prohibited the spread of slavery
and both acts show conclusively that they considered that the thing was wrong
if additional proof is wanted it can be found in the phraseology of the constitution
when men are framing a supreme law and chart of government
to secure blessings and prosperity to untold generations yet to come
they use language as short and direct and plain as can be found
to express their meaning in all matters but this of slavery the framers of the constitution used the very clearest
and most direct language
but the constitution alludes to slavery three times without mentioning it once the language used becomes ambiguous
and mystical
they speak of the immigration of persons
and mean the importation of slaves
but do not say so
in establishing a basis of representation they say all other persons
when they mean to say slaves why did they not use the shortest phrase
in providing for the return of fugitives they say persons held to service or labor
if they had said slaves it would have been plainer
and less liable to misconstruction
why did n't they do it
we cannot doubt that it was done on purpose
only one reason is possible
and that is supplied us by one of the framers of the constitution and it is not possible for man to conceive of any other they expected and desired that the system would come to an end
and meant that when it did
the constitution should not show that there ever had been a slave in this good free country of ours
i will dwell on that no longer
i see the signs of approaching triumph of the republicans in the bearing of their political adversaries
a great deal of their war with us nowadays is mere bushwhacking
at the battle of waterloo
when napoleon's cavalry had charged again and again upon the unbroken squares of british infantry
at last they were giving up the attempt
and going off in disorder
when some of the officers in mere vexation and complete despair fired their pistols at those solid squares
the democrats are in that sort of extreme desperation it is nothing else
i will take up a few of these arguments
there is the irrepressible conflict
how they rail at seward for that saying
they repeat it constantly and
although the proof has been thrust under their noses again and again that almost every good man since the formation of our government has uttered that same sentiment
from general washington
who trusted that we should yet have a confederacy of free states
with jefferson
down to the latest days
yet they refuse to notice that at all
and persist in railing at seward for saying it
even roger a
editor of the richmond enquirer
uttered the same sentiment in almost the same language
and yet so little offence did it give the democrats that he was sent for to washington to edit the states the douglas organ there while douglas goes into hydrophobia and spasms of rage because seward dared to repeat it
this is what i call bushwhacking
a sort of argument that they must know any child can see through
another is john brown
you stir up insurrections
you invade the south john brown
harper's ferry
why
john brown was not a republican
you have never implicated a single republican in that harper's ferry enterprise
we tell you that if any member of the republican party is guilty in that matter
you know it or you do not know it
if you do know it
you are inexcusable not to designate the man and prove the fact
if you do not know it
you are inexcusable to assert it
and especially to persist in the assertion after you have tried and failed to make the proof
you need not be told that persisting in a charge which one does not know to be true is simply malicious slander
some of you admit that no republican designedly aided or encouraged the harper's ferry affair
but still insist that our doctrines and declarations necessarily lead to such results
we do not believe it
we know we hold to no doctrines
and make no declarations
which were not held to and made by our fathers who framed the government 'under which we live
and we cannot see how declarations that were patriotic when they made them are villainous when we make them
you never dealt fairly by us in relation to that affair and i will say frankly that i know of nothing in your character that should lead us to suppose that you would
you had just been soundly thrashed in elections in several states
and others were soon to come
you rejoiced at the occasion
and only were troubled that there were not three times as many killed in the affair
you were in evident glee there was no sorrow for the killed nor for the peace of virginia disturbed you were rejoicing that by charging republicans with this thing you might get an advantage of us in new york
and the other states
you pulled that string as tightly as you could
but your very generous and worthy expectations were not quite fulfilled
each republican knew that the charge was a slander as to himself at least
and was not inclined by it to cast his vote in your favor
it was mere bushwhacking
because you had nothing else to do
you are still on that track
and i say
go on
if you think you can slander a woman into loving you or a man into voting for you
try it till you are satisfied
another specimen of this bushwhacking
that shoe strike
now be it understood that i do not pretend to know all about the matter
i am merely going to speculate a little about some of its phases
and at the outset
i am glad to see that a system of labor prevails in new england under which laborers can strike when they want to
where they are not obliged to work under all circumstances
and are not tied down and obliged to labor whether you pay them or not
i like the system which lets a man quit when he wants to
and wish it might prevail everywhere
one of the reasons why i am opposed to slavery is just here
what is the true condition of the laborer
i take it that it is best for all to leave each man free to acquire property as fast as he can
some will get wealthy
i don't believe in a law to prevent a man from getting rich it would do more harm than good
while we do not propose any war upon capital
we do wish to allow the humblest man an equal chance to get rich with everybody else
when one starts poor
as most do in the race of life
free society is such that he knows he can better his condition he knows that there is no fixed condition of labor for his whole life
i am not ashamed to confess that twenty five years ago i was a hired laborer
mauling rails
at work on a flatboat just what might happen to any poor man's son
i want every man to have a chance and i believe a black man is entitled to it in which he can better his condition when he may look forward and hope to be a hired laborer this year and the next
work for himself afterward
and finally to hire men to work for him
that is the system
up here in new england
you have a soil that scarcely sprouts black eyed beans
and yet where will you find wealthy men so wealthy
and poverty so rarely in extremity
there is not another such place on earth
i desire that if you get too thick here
and find it hard to better your condition on this soil
you may have a chance to strike and go somewhere else
where you may not be degraded
nor have your families corrupted
by forced rivalry with negro slaves
i want you to have a clean bed and no snakes in it
then you can better your condition
and so it may go on and on in one endless round so long as man exists on the face of the earth
to come back to this shoe strike
as the senator from illinois asserts
this is caused by withdrawal of southern votes
consider briefly how you will meet the difficulty
you have done nothing
and have protested that you have done nothing
to injure the south
and yet
to get back the shoe trade
you must leave off doing something which you are now doing
what is it
you must stop thinking slavery wrong
let your institutions be wholly changed let your state constitutions be subverted glorify slavery
and so you will get back the shoe trade for what
you have brought owned labor with it
to compete with your own labor
to underwork you
and to degrade you
are you ready to get back the trade on those terms
but the statement is not correct
you have not lost that trade orders were never better than now
senator mason
a democrat
comes into the senate in homespun
a proof that the dissolution of the union has actually begun
but orders are the same
your factories have not struck work
neither those where they make anything for coats
nor for pants nor for shirts
nor for ladies' dresses
mason has not reached the manufacturers who ought to have made him a coat and pants
to make his proof good for anything he should have come into the senate barefoot
another bushwhacking contrivance simply that
nothing else
i find a good many people who are very much concerned about the loss of southern trade
now either these people are sincere or they are not
i will speculate a little about that
if they are sincere
and are moved by any real danger of the loss of southern trade
they will simply get their names on the white list
and then
instead of persuading republicans to do likewise
they will be glad to keep you away
don't you see that they cut off competition
they would not be whispering around to republicans to come in and share the profits with them
but if they are not sincere
and are merely trying to fool republicans out of their votes
they will grow very anxious about your pecuniary prospects they are afraid you are going to get broken up and ruined they do not care about democratic votes
you must judge which class those belong to whom you meet
i leave it to you to determine from the facts
let us notice some more of the stale charges against republicans
you say we are sectional
we deny it
that makes an issue and the burden of proof is upon you
you produce your proof and what is it
that our party has no existence in your section gets no votes in your section
the fact is substantially true but does it prove the issue
if it does
then in case we should
without change of principle
begin to get votes in your section
we should thereby cease to be sectional
you cannot escape this conclusion and yet
are you willing to abide by it
if you are
you will probably soon find that we have ceased to be sectional
for we shall get votes in your section this very year
the fact that we get no votes in your section is a fact of your making and not of ours
and if there be fault in that fact
that fault is primarily yours
and remains so until you show that we repel you by some wrong principle or practice
if we ours but this brings you to where you ought to have started to a discussion of the right or wrong of our principle
if our principle
put in practice
would wrong your section for the benefit of ours
or for any other object
then our principle
and we with it
are sectional
and are justly opposed and denounced as such
meet us
on the question of whether our principle put in practice would wrong your section and so meet it as if it were possible that something may be said on our side
do you accept the challenge
then you really believe that the principle which our fathers who framed the government under which we live thought so clearly right as to adopt it
and indorse it again and again
upon their official oaths
is in fact so clearly wrong as to demand our condemnation without a moment's consideration
some of you delight to flaunt in our faces the warning against sectional parties given by washington in his farewell address
less than eight years before washington gave that warning
he had
as president of the united states
approved and signed an act of congress enforcing the prohibition of slavery in the northwestern territory
which act embodied the policy of government upon that subject
up to and at the very moment he penned that warning and about one year after he penned it he wrote la fayette that he considered that prohibition a wise measure
expressing in the same connection his hope that we should sometime have a confederacy of free states
bearing this in mind
and seeing that sectionalism has since arisen upon this same subject
is that warning a weapon in your hands against us
or in our hands against you
could washington himself speak
would he cast the blame of that sectionalism upon us
who sustain his policy
or upon you
who repudiate it
we respect that warning of washington
and we commend it to you
together with his example pointing to the right application of it
but you say you are conservative eminently conservative while we are revolutionary
or something of the sort
what is conservatism
is it not adherence to the old and tried
against the new and untried
we stick to
contend for
the identical old policy on the point in controversy which was adopted by our fathers who framed the government under which we live while you with one accord reject and scout and spit upon that old policy
and insist upon substituting something new
you disagree among yourselves as to what that substitute shall be
you have considerable variety of new propositions and plans
but you are unanimous in rejecting and denouncing the old policy of the fathers
some of you are for reviving the foreign slave trade some for a congressional slave code for the territories some for congress forbidding the territories to prohibit slavery within their limits some for maintaining slavery in the territories through the judiciary some for the gur reat pur rinciple that if one man would enslave another
no third man should object fantastically called popular sovereignty
but never a man among you in favor of prohibition of slavery in federal territories
according to the practice of our fathers who framed the government under which we live
not one of all your various plans can show a precedent or an advocate in the century within which our government originated
and yet you draw yourselves up and say
we are eminently conservative
it is exceedingly desirable that all parts of this great confederacy shall be at peace
and in harmony one with another
let us republicans do our part to have it so
even though much provoked
let us do nothing through passion and ill temper
even though the southern people will not so much as listen to us
let us calmly consider their demands
and yield to them if
in our deliberate view of our duty
we possibly can
judging by all they say and do
and by the subject and nature of their controversy with us
let us determine
if we can
what will satisfy them
will they be satisfied if the territories be unconditionally surrendered to them
we know they will not
in all their present complaints against us
the territories are scarcely mentioned
invasions and insurrections are the rage now
will it satisfy them
in the future
if we have nothing to do with invasions and insurrections
we know it will not
we so know because we know we never had anything to do with invasions and insurrections and yet this total abstaining does not exempt us from the charge and the denunciation
the question recurs
what will satisfy them
simply this
we must not only let them alone
but we must
convince them that we do let them alone
we know by experience
is no easy task
we have been so trying to convince them
from the very beginning of our organization
but with no success
in all our platforms and speeches
we have constantly protested our purpose to let them alone but this had no tendency to convince them
alike unavailing to convince them is the fact that they have never detected a man of us in any attempt to disturb them
these natural and apparently adequate means all failing
what will convince them
and this only
cease to call slavery wrong
and join them in calling it right
and this must be done thoroughly done in acts as well as in words
silence will not be tolerated we must place ourselves avowedly with them
douglas's new sedition law must be enacted and enforced
suppressing all declarations that slavery is wrong
whether made in politics
in presses
in pulpits
or in private
we must arrest and return their fugitive slaves with greedy pleasure
we must pull down our free state constitutions
the whole atmosphere must be disinfected of all taint of opposition to slavery
before they will cease to believe that all their troubles proceed from us
so long as we call slavery wrong
whenever a slave runs away they will overlook the obvious fact that he ran away because he was oppressed
and declare he was stolen off
whenever a master cuts his slaves with a lash
and they cry out under it
he will overlook the obvious fact that the negroes cry out because they are hurt
and insist that they were put up to it by some rascally abolitionist
i am quite aware that they do not state their case precisely in this way
most of them would probably say to us
let us alone
do nothing to us
and say what you please about slavery
but we do let them alone have never disturbed them so that
after all
it is what we say which dissatisfies them
they will continue to accuse us of doing
until we cease saying
i am also aware that they have not as yet in terms demanded the overthrow of our free state constitutions
yet those constitutions declare the wrong of slavery with more solemn emphasis than do all other sayings against it and when all these other sayings shall have been silenced
the overthrow of these constitutions will be demanded
it is nothing to the contrary that they do not demand the whole of this just now
demanding what they do
and for the reason they do
they can voluntarily stop nowhere short of this consummation
holding as they do that slavery is morally right
and socially elevating
they cannot cease to demand a full national recognition of it
as a legal right
and a social blessing
nor can we justifiably withhold this on any ground save our conviction that slavery is wrong
if slavery is right
all words
and constitutions against it are themselves wrong and should be silenced and swept away
if it is right
we cannot justly object to its nationality its universality
if it is wrong
they cannot justly insist upon its extension its enlargement
all they ask
we could readily grant
if we thought slavery right all we ask
they could as readily grant
if they thought it wrong
their thinking it right and our thinking it wrong is the precise fact on which depends the whole controversy
thinking it right as they do
they are not to blame for desiring its full recognition
as being right but
thinking it wrong
as we do
can we yield to them
can we cast our votes with their view
and against our own
in view of our moral
and political responsibilities
can we do this
wrong as we think slavery is
we can yet afford to let it alone where it is because that much is due to the necessity arising from its actual presence in the nation but can we
while our votes will prevent it
allow it to spread into the national territories
and to overrun us here in these free states
if our sense of duty forbids this
then let us stand by our duty
fearlessly and effectively
let us be diverted by none of those sophistical contrivances wherewith we are so industriously plied and belabored contrivances such as groping for some middle ground between the right and the wrong
vain as the search for a man who would be neither a living man nor a dead man such as a policy of don't care on a question about which all free men do care such as union appeals beseeching true union men to yield to disunionists
reversing the divine rule
and caning
not the sinners
but the righteous to repentance such as invocations of washington
imploring men to unsay what washington did
neither let us be slandered from our duty by false accusations against us
nor frightened from it by menaces of destruction to the government
nor of dungeons to ourselves
let us have faith that right makes might and in that faith
let us
to the end
dare to do our duty as we understand it
as mr
lincoln concluded his address
there was witnessed the wildest scene of enthusiasm and excitement that has been in new haven for years
the palladium editorially says
we give up most of our space to day to a very full report of the eloquent speech of the hon
abraham lincoln
of illinois
delivered last night at union hall
response to an elector's request for money to march 16
1860 as to your kind wishes for myself
allow me to say i cannot enter the ring on the money basis first
because in the main it is wrong and secondly
i have not and cannot get the money
i say
in the main
the use of money is wrong but for certain objects in a political contest
the use of some is both right and indispensable
with me
as with yourself
the long struggle has been one of great pecuniary loss
i now distinctly say this if you shall be appointed a delegate to chicago
i will furnish one hundred dollars to bear the expenses of the trip

dear sir
reaching home three days ago
i found your letter of february 26th
considering your difficulty of hearing
i think you had better settle in chicago
as you say
a good man already in fair practice there will take you into partnership
if you had not that difficulty
i still should think it an even balance whether you would not better remain in chicago
with such a chance for copartnership
if i went west
i think i would go to kansas
to leavenworth or atchison
both of them are and will continue to be fine growing places
i believe i have said all i can
and i have said it with the deepest interest for your welfare
yours truly
accusation of having been paid for a political speech to c
april 6
1860 c
dear sir
reaching home yesterday
i found yours of the 23d march
inclosing a slip from the middleport press
it is not true that i ever charged anything for a political speech in my life but this much is true
last october i was requested by letter to deliver some sort of speech in mr
beecher's church
in brooklyn two hundred dollars being offered in the first letter
i wrote that i could do it in february
provided they would take a political speech if i could find time to get up no other
they agreed and subsequently i informed them the speech would have to be a political one
when i reached new york
i for the first time learned that the place was changed to cooper institute
i made the speech
and left for new hampshire
where i have a son at school
neither asking for pay nor having any offered me
three days after a check for two hundred dollars was sent to me at new hampshire and i took it
and did not know it was wrong
my understanding now is though i knew nothing of it at the time that they did charge for admittance to the cooper institute
and that they took in more than twice two hundred dollars
i have made this explanation to you as a friend but i wish no explanation made to our enemies
what they want is a squabble and a fuss
and that they can have if we explain and they cannot have it if we don't
when i returned through new york from new england
i was told by the gentlemen who sent me the check that a drunken vagabond in the club
having learned something about the two hundred dollars
made the exhibition out of which the herald manufactured the article quoted by the press of your town
my judgment is
and therefore my request is
that you give no denial and no explanation
thanking you for your kind interest in the matter
i remain

it surprises me that you have written twice
without receiving an answer
i have answered all i ever received from you and certainly one since my return from the east
opinions here
as to the prospect of douglas being nominated
are quite conflicting some very confident he will
and others that he will not be
i think his nomination possible
but that the chances are against him
i am glad there is a prospect of your party passing this way to chicago
wishing to make your visit here as pleasant as we can
we wish you to notify us as soon as possible whether you come this way
how many

deeply and even painfully sensible of the great responsibility which is inseparable from this high honor a responsibility which i could almost wish had fallen upon some one of the far more eminent men and experienced statesmen whose distinguished names were before the convention i shall
by your leave
consider more fully the resolutions of the convention
denominated their platform
and without any unnecessary or unreasonable delay respond to you
in writing not doubting that the platform will be found satisfactory

acting as a committee of the convention for that purpose
the declaration of principles and sentiments which accompanies your letter meets my approval and it shall be my care not to violate or disregard it in any part
imploring the assistance of divine providence
and with due regard to the views and feelings of all who were represented in the convention
to the rights of all the states and territories and people of the nation

springfield
1860 dear sir
your letter to mr
lincoln of and by which you seek to obtain his opinions on certain political points
has been received by him
he has received others of a similar character
but he also has a greater number of the exactly opposite character
the latter class beseech him to write nothing whatever upon any point of political doctrine
they say his positions were well known when he was nominated
and that he must not now embarrass the canvass by undertaking to shift or modify them
he regrets that he cannot oblige all
but you perceive it is impossible for him to do so

but till now have found no moment to say a word by way of answer
of course i am glad that the nomination is well received by our friends
and i sincerely thank you for so informing me
so far as i can learn
the nominations start well everywhere and
if they get no back set
it would seem as if they are going through
i hope you will write often and as you write more rapidly than i do

unauthorized biography to s

sam'l galloway
my dear sir
your very kind letter of the 15th is received
co
s life of me is not by my authority and i have scarcely been so much astounded by anything
as by their public announcement that it is authorized by me
they have fallen into some strange misunderstanding
i certainly knew they contemplated publishing a biography
and i certainly did not object to their doing so
upon their own responsibility
i even took pains to facilitate them
at the same time
i made myself tiresome
if not hoarse
with repeating to mr
their only agent seen by me
my protest that i authorized nothing would be responsible for nothing
how they could so misunderstand me
passes comprehension
as a matter wholly my own
i would authorize no biography
without time and opportunity sic to carefully examine and consider every word of it and
in this case
in the nature of things
i can have no such time and opportunity sic
in my present position
by the lessons of the past
and the united voice of all discreet friends
i can neither write nor speak a word for the public
how dare i to send forth
by my authority
a volume of hundreds of pages
for adversaries to make points upon without end
were i to do so
the convention would have a right to re assemble and substitute another name for mine
for these reasons
i would not look at the proof sheets i am determined to maintain the position of sic truly saying i never saw the proof sheets
or any part of their work
before its publication
do not mistake me i feel great kindness for messrs
co
do not think they have intentionally done wrong
there may be nothing wrong in their proposed book i sincerely hope there will not
i barely suggest that you
or any of the friends there
on the party account
look it over
and exclude what you may think would embarrass the party bearing in mind
at all times
that i authorize nothing will be responsible for nothing
your friend
as ever
the custom then
and it may have been a good one
was for the presidential candidate to do no personal canvassing or speaking or as we have it now running for election
he stayed at home and kept his mouth shut

my dear sir
it appears to me that you and i ought to be acquainted
and accordingly i write this as a sort of introduction of myself to you
you first entered the senate during the single term i was a member of the house of representatives
but i have no recollection that we were introduced
i shall be pleased to receive a line from you
the prospect of republican success now appears very flattering
so far as i can perceive
do you see anything to the contrary
yours truly

springfield
july 21
my dear sir
yours of the 20th is received
i suppose as good or even better men than i may have been in american or know nothing lodges but in point of fact
i never was in one at quincy or elsewhere
i was never in quincy but one day and two nights while know nothing lodges were in existence
and you were with me that day and both those nights
i had never been there before in my life
and never afterward
till the joint debate with douglas in 1858
it was in 1854 when i spoke in some hall there
and after the speaking
with others
took me to an oyster saloon
passed an hour there
and you walked with me to
and parted with me at
the quincy house
quite late at night
i left by stage for naples before daylight in the morning
having come in by the same route after dark the evening
previous to the speaking
when i found you waiting at the quincy house to meet me
a few days after i was there
as i understood
started this same story about my having been in a know nothing lodge
when i heard of the charge
as i did soon after i taxed my recollection for some incident which could have suggested it and i remembered that on parting with you the last night i went to the office of the hotel to take my stage passage for the morning
was told that no stage office for that line was kept there
and that i must see the driver before retiring
to insure his calling for me in the morning and a servant was sent with me to find the driver
after taking me a square or two
stopped me
and stepped perhaps a dozen steps farther
and in my hearing called to some one
who answered him
apparently from the upper part of a building
and promised to call with the stage for me at the quincy house
i returned
and went to bed
and before day the stage called and took me
this is all
that i never was in a know nothing lodge in quincy
i should expect could be easily proved by respectable men who were always in the lodges and never saw me there
an affidavit of one or two such would put the matter at rest
and now a word of caution
our adversaries think they can gain a point if they could force me to openly deny the charge
by which some degree of offence would be given to the americans
for this reason it must not publicly appear that i am paying any attention to the charge

inclosing the letter of hon
john minor botts
was duly received
the latter is herewith returned according to your request
it contains one of the many assurances i receive from the south
that in no probable event will there be any very formidable effort to break up the union
the people of the south have too much of good sense and good temper to attempt the ruin of the government rather than see it administered as it was administered by the men who made it
at least so i hope and believe
i thank you both for your own letter and a sight of that of mr

august 17 1860
my dear sir
yours of the 13th was received this morning
douglas is managing the bell element with great adroitness
he had his men in kentucky to vote for the bell candidate
producing a result which has badly alarmed and damaged breckenridge
and at the same time has induced the bell men to suppose that bell will certainly be president
if they can keep a few of the northern states away from us by throwing them to douglas
but you
better than i
understand all this
i think there will be the most extraordinary effort ever made to carry new york for douglas
you and all others who write me from your state think the effort cannot succeed
and i hope you are right
it will require close watching and great efforts on the other side
herewith i send you a copy of a letter written at new york
which sufficiently explains itself
and which may or may not give you a valuable hint
you have seen that bell tickets have been put on the track both here and in indiana
in both cases the object has been
i think
the same as the hunt movement in new york to throw states to douglas
in our state
we know the thing is engineered by douglas men
and we do not believe they can make a great deal out of it

springfield
1860 my dear sir
yours of the 27th is duly received
it consists almost exclusively of a historical detail of some local troubles
among some of our friends in pennsylvania and i suppose its object is to guard me against forming a prejudice against mr
i have not heard near so much upon that subject as you probably suppose and i am slow to listen to criminations among friends
and never expose their quarrels on either side
my sincere wish is that both sides will allow bygones to be bygones
and look to the present and future only

my dear sir
i am annoyed some by a letter from a friend in chicago
in which the following passage occurs
hamlin has written colfax that two members of congress will
he fears
be lost in maine
the first and sixth districts and that washburne's majority for governor will not exceed six thousand
i had heard something like this six weeks ago
but had been assured since that it was not so
your secretary of state
i think
whom you introduced to me by letter
gave this assurance more recently
our candidate for congress in one of those districts
wrote a relative here that his election was sure by at least five thousand
and that washburne's majority would be from 14
000 to 17
000 and still later
of new hampshire
now at new york serving on a national committee
wrote me that we were having a desperate fight in maine
which would end in a splendid victory for us
such a result as you seem to have predicted in maine
in your letter to colfax
i fear
put us on the down hill track
lose us the state elections in pennsylvania and indiana
and probably ruin us on the main turn in november
you must not allow it

my dear sir
i certainly am in no temper and have no purpose to embitter the feelings of the south
but whether i am inclined to such a course as would in fact embitter their feelings you can better judge by my published speeches than by anything i would say in a short letter if i were inclined now
as i am not
to define my position anew

1860 major david hunter my dear sir
your very kind letter of the 20th was duly received
for which please accept my thanks
i have another letter
from a writer unknown to me
saying the officers of the army at fort kearny have determined in case of republican success at the approaching presidential election
to take themselves
and the arms at that point
for the purpose of resistance to the government
while i think there are many chances to one that this is a humbug
it occurs to me that any real movement of this sort in the army would leak out and become known to you
in such case
if it would not be unprofessional or dishonorable of which you are to be judge
i shall be much obliged if you will apprise me of it

remarks at the meeting at springfield
illinois november 20
1860 friends and fellow citizens
please excuse me on this occasion from making a speech
i thank you in common with all those who have thought fit by their votes to indorse the republican cause
i rejoice with you in the success which has thus far attended that cause
yet in all our rejoicings let us neither express nor cherish any hard feelings toward any citizen who by his vote has differed with us
let us at all times remember that all american citizens are brothers of a common country
and should dwell together in the bonds of fraternal feeling
let me again beg you to accept my thanks
and to excuse me from further speaking at this time

my dear sir
your long letter received
as far as possible
any of our friends from demoralizing themselves and our cause by entertaining propositions for compromise of any sort on slavery extension
there is no possible compromise upon it but which puts us under again
and leaves all our work to do over again
whether it be a missouri line or eli thayer's popular sovereignty
it is all the same
let either be done
and immediately filibustering and extending slavery recommences
on that point hold firm

opinion on secession to thurlow weed springfield
december 17
1860 my dear sir
yours of the 11th was received two days ago
should the convocation of governors of which you speak seem desirous to know my views on the present aspect of things
tell them you judge from my speeches that i will be inflexible on the territorial question but i probably think either the missouri line extended
or douglas's and eli thayer's popular sovereignty would lose us everything we gain by the election that filibustering for all south of us and making slave states of it would follow in spite of us
in either case also that i probably think all opposition
real and apparent
to the fugitive slave clause of the constitution ought to be withdrawn
i believe you can pretend to find but little
if anything
in my speeches
about secession
but my opinion is that no state can in any way lawfully get out of the union without the consent of the others and that it is the duty of the president and other government functionaries to run the machine as it is

alexander stevens my dear sir
your obliging answer to my short note is just received
and for which please accept my thanks
i fully appreciate the present peril the country is in
and the weight of responsibility on me
do the people of the south really entertain fear that a republican administration would
directly or indirectly
interfere with the slaves
or with them about the slaves
if they do
i wish to assure you
as once a friend
and still
i hope
not an enemy
that there is no cause for such fears
the south would be in no more danger in this respect than it was in the days of washington
i suppose
this does not meet the case
you think slavery is right and ought to be extended
while we think it is wrong and ought to be restricted
i suppose
is the rub
it certainly is the only substantial difference between us
yours very truly
support of the fugitive slave clause memorandum december 22
1860 resolved
that the fugitive slave clause of the constitution ought to be enforced by a law of congress
with efficient provisions for that object
not obliging private persons to assist in its execution
but punishing all who resist it
and with the usual safeguards to liberty
securing free men against being surrendered as slaves
that all state laws
if there be such
really or apparently in conflict with such law of congress
ought to be repealed and no opposition to the execution of such law of congress ought to be made
that the federal union must be preserved

springfield
january 3
dear sir
yours without signature was received last night
i have been considering your suggestions as to my reaching washington somewhat earlier than is usual
it seems to me the inauguration is not the most dangerous point for us
our adversaries have us now clearly at disadvantage on the second wednesday of february
when the votes should be officially counted
if the two houses refuse to meet at all
or meet without a quorum of each
where shall we be
i do not think that this counting is constitutionally essential to the election
but how are we to proceed in the absence of it
in view of this
i think it is best for me not to attempt appearing in washington till the result of that ceremony is known
it certainly would be of some advantage if you could know who are to be at the heads of the war and navy departments
but until i can ascertain definitely whether i can get any suitable men from the south
and who
and how many
i can not well decide
as yet
i have no word from mr
gilmer in answer to my request for an interview with him
i look for something on the subject

my dear sir
yours of the 8th received
i still hope mr
gilmer will
on a fair understanding with us
consent to take a place in the cabinet
the preference for him over mr
hunt or mr
gentry is that
up to date he has a living position in the south
while they have not
he is only better than winter davis in that he is farther south
i fear
if we could get
we could not safely take more than one such man that is
not more than one who opposed us in the election the danger being to lose the confidence of our own friends
your selection for the state department having become public
i am happy to find scarcely any objection to it

patronage claims to thurlow weed springfield
february 4
1861 dear sir
i have both your letter to myself and that to judge davis
in relation to a certain gentleman in your state claiming to dispense patronage in my name
and also to be authorized to use my name to advance the chances of mr
greeley for an election to the united states senate
it is very strange that such things should be said by any one
the gentleman you mention did speak to me of mr
greeley in connection with the senatorial election
and i replied in terms of kindness toward mr
which i really feel
but always with an expressed protest that my name must not be used in the senatorial election in favor of or against any one
any other representation of me is a misrepresentation
as to the matter of dispensing patronage
it perhaps will surprise you to learn that i have information that you claim to have my authority to arrange that matter in new york
i do not believe you have so claimed but still so some men say
on that subject you know all i have said to you is justice to all
and i have said nothing more particular to any one
i say this to reassure you that i have not changed my position
in the hope
that you will not use my name in the matter
i am

farewell address at springfield
february 11
1861 my friends
one who has never been placed in a like position cannot understand my feelings at this hour
nor the oppressive sadness i feel at this parting
for more than twenty five years i have lived among you
and during all that time i have received nothing but kindness at your hands
here the most cherished ties of earth were assumed
here my children were born
and here one of them lies buried
to you
my friends
i owe all that i have
all that i am
all the strange checkered past seems to crowd upon my mind
to day i leave you
i go to assume a task more difficult than that which devolved upon general washington
unless the great god who assisted him shall be with and aid me i cannot prevail but if the same almighty arm that directed and protected him shall guide and support me i shall not fail i shall succeed
let us pray that the god of our fathers may not forsake us now
to him i commend you all
permit me to ask that with equal sincerity and faith you will all invoke his wisdom and goodness for me
with these words i must leave you for how long i know not
one and all
i must now wish you an affectionate farewell
remarks at tolono
february 11
1861 i am leaving you on an errand of national importance
as you are aware
with considerable difficulties
let us believe
as some poet has expressed it
behind the cloud the sun is still shining
i bid you an affectionate farewell
reply to address of welcome
february 11
1861 governor morton and fellow citizens of the state of indiana
most heartily do i thank you for this magnificent reception
and while i cannot take to myself any share of the compliment thus paid
more than that which pertains to a mere instrument
an accidental instrument
perhaps i should say
of a great cause
i yet must look upon it as a most magnificent reception
and as such most heartily do thank you for it
you have been pleased to address yourself to me chiefly in behalf of this glorious union in which we live
in all of which you have my hearty sympathy
as far as may be within my power
will have
one and inseparable
my hearty consideration
while i do not expect
upon this occasion
or until i get to washington
to attempt any lengthy speech
i will only say to the salvation of the union there needs but one single thing the hearts of a people like yours
the people when they rise in mass in behalf of the union and the liberties of their country
truly may it be said
the gates of hell cannot prevail against them
in all trying positions in which i shall be placed and
i shall be placed in many such my reliance will be placed upon you and the people of the united states and i wish you to remember
now and forever
that it is your business
and not mine that if the union of these states and the liberties of this people shall be lost
it is but little to any one man of fifty two years of age
but a great deal to the thirty millions of people who inhabit these united states
and to their posterity in all coming time
it is your business to rise up and preserve the union and liberty for yourselves
and not for me
i desire they should be constitutionally performed
as already intimated
am but an accidental instrument
and to serve but for a limited time and i appeal to you again to constantly bear in mind that with you
and not with politicians
not with presidents
not with office seekers
but with you is the question
shall the union and shall the liberties of this country be preserved to the latest generations
address to the legislature of indiana
at indianapolis
february 12
1861 fellow citizens of the state of indiana
i am here to thank you much for this magnificent welcome
and still more for the generous support given by your state to that political cause which i think is the true and just cause of the whole country and the whole world
solomon says there is a time to keep silence
and when men wrangle by the mouth with no certainty that they mean the same thing while using the same word
it perhaps were as well if they would keep silence
the words coercion and invasion are much used in these days
and often with some temper and hot blood
let us make sure
if we can
the meaning of those who use them
let us get the exact definitions of these words
not from dictionaries
but from the men themselves
who certainly deprecate the things they would represent by the use of the words
is coercion
what is invasion
would the marching of an army into south carolina
without the consent of her people
and with hostile intent toward them
be invasion
i certainly think it would
and it would be coercion also
if the south carolinians were forced to submit
but if the united states should merely hold and retake its own forts and other property
and collect the duties on foreign importations
or even withhold the mails from places where they were habitually violated
would any or all of these things be invasion or coercion
do our professed lovers of the union
who spitefully resolve that they will resist coercion and invasion
understand that such things as these
on the part of the united states
would be coercion or invasion of a state
if so
their idea of means to preserve the object of their great affection would seem to be exceedingly thin and airy
if sick
the little pills of the homoeopathist would be much too large for it to swallow
in their view
the union
as a family relation
would seem to be no regular marriage
but rather a sort of free love arrangement
to be maintained on passional attraction
by the way
in what consists the special sacredness of a state
i speak not of the position assigned to a state in the union by the constitution
for that is a bond we all recognize
that position
a state cannot carry out of the union with it
i speak of that assumed primary right of a state to rule all which is less than itself
and to ruin all which is larger than itself
if a state and a county
in a given case
should be equal in number of inhabitants
in what
as a matter of principle
is the state better than the county
would an exchange of name be an exchange of rights
upon what principle
upon what rightful principle
may a state
being no more than one fiftieth part of the nation in soil and population
break up the nation
and then coerce a proportionably large subdivision of itself in the most arbitrary way
what mysterious right to play tyrant is conferred on a district of country
with its people
by merely calling it a state
i am not asserting anything
i am merely asking questions for you to consider
and now allow me to bid you farewell
intentions toward the south address to the mayor and citizens of cincinnati
february 12
1861 mr
and gentlemen
twenty four hours ago
at the capital of indiana
i said to myself
i have never seen so many people assembled together in winter weather
i am no longer able to say that
but it is what might reasonably have been expected that this great city of cincinnati would thus acquit herself on such an occasion
my friends
i am entirely overwhelmed by the magnificence of the reception which has been given
i will not say to me
but to the president elect of the united states of america
most heartily do i thank you
one and all
for it
i have spoken but once before this in cincinnati
that was a year previous to the late presidential election
on that occasion
in a playful manner
but with sincere words
i addressed much of what i said to the kentuckians
i gave my opinion that we
as republicans
would ultimately beat them as democrats
but that they could postpone that result longer by nominating senator douglas for the presidency than they could by any other way
they did not
in any true sense of the word
nominate mr
and the result has come certainly as soon as ever i expected
i also told them how i expected they would be treated after they should have been beaten
and i now wish to call their attention to what i then said upon that subject
i then said
when we do as we say
beat you
you perhaps want to know what we will do with you
i will tell you
as far as i am authorized to speak for the opposition
what we mean to do with you
we mean to treat you
as near as we possibly can
as washington
and madison treated you
we mean to leave you alone
and in no way to interfere with your institutions to abide by all and every compromise of the constitution
in a word
coming back to the original proposition
to treat you so far as degenerate men
if we have degenerated
according to the example of those noble fathers
and madison
we mean to remember that you are as good as we that there is no difference between us other than the difference of circumstances
we mean to recognize and bear in mind always that you have as good hearts in your bosoms as other people
or as we claim to have
and treat you accordingly
fellow citizens of kentucky friends and brethren
may i call you in my new position
i see no occasion and feel no inclination to retract a word of this
if it shall not be made good
be assured the fault shall not be mine
address to the german club of cincinnati
february 12
1861 mr
i thank you and those whom you represent for the compliment you have paid me by tendering me this address
in so far as there is an allusion to our present national difficulties
which expresses
as you have said
the views of the gentlemen present
i shall have to beg pardon for not entering fully upon the questions which the address you have now read suggests
i deem it my duty a duty which i owe to my constituents to you
that i should wait until the last moment for a development of the present national difficulties before i express myself decidedly as to what course i shall pursue
i hope
not to be false to anything that you have expected of me
i agree with you
that the working men are the basis of all governments
for the plain reason that they are all the more numerous
and as you added that those were the sentiments of the gentlemen present
representing not only the working class
but citizens of other callings than those of the mechanic
i am happy to concur with you in these sentiments
not only of the native born citizens
but also of the germans and foreigners from other countries
i hold that while man exists it is his duty to improve not only his own condition
but to assist in ameliorating the condition of mankind and therefore
without entering upon the details of the question
i will simply say that i am for those means which will give the greatest good to the greatest number
in regard to the homestead law
i have to say that
in so far as the government lands can be disposed of
i am in favor of cutting up the wild lands into parcels
so that every poor man may have a home
in regard to the germans and foreigners
i esteem them no better than other people
nor any worse
it is not my nature
when i see a people borne down by the weight of their shackles the oppression of tyranny to make their life more bitter by heaping upon them greater burdens but rather would i do all in my power to raise the yoke than to add anything that would tend to crush them
inasmuch as our own country is extensive and new
and the countries of europe are densely populated
if there are any abroad who desire to make this the land of their adoption
it is not in my heart to throw aught in their way to prevent them from coming to the united states
chairman and gentlemen
i will bid you an affectionate farewell
address to the legislature of ohio at columbus february 13
1861 mr
president and mr
and gentlemen of the general assembly of ohio
it is true
as has been said by the president of the senate
that very great responsibility rests upon me in the position to which the votes of the american people have called me
i am deeply sensible of that weighty responsibility
i cannot but know what you all know
that without a name
perhaps without a reason why i should have a name
there has fallen upon me a task such as did not rest even upon the father of his country and so feeling
i can turn and look for that support without which it will be impossible for me to perform that great task
i turn
and look to the american people and to that god who has never forsaken them
allusion has been made to the interest felt in relation to the policy of the new administration
in this i have received from some a degree of credit for having kept silence
and from others some deprecation
i still think that i was right
in the varying and repeatedly shifting scenes of the present
and without a precedent which could enable me to judge by the past
it has seemed fitting that before speaking upon the difficulties of the country i should have gained a view of the whole field
being at liberty to modify and change the course of policy as future events may make a change necessary
i have not maintained silence from any want of real anxiety
it is a good thing that there is no more than anxiety
for there is nothing going wrong
it is a consoling circumstance that when we look out there is nothing that really hurts anybody
we entertain different views upon political questions
but nobody is suffering anything
this is a most consoling circumstance
and from it we may conclude that all we want is time
and a reliance on that god who has never forsaken this people
what i have said i have said altogether extemporaneously
and i will now come to a close
address at steubenville
february 14
1861 i fear that the great confidence placed in my ability is unfounded
i am sure it is
encompassed by vast difficulties as i am
nothing shall be wanting on my part
if sustained by god and the american people
i believe the devotion to the constitution is equally great on both sides of the river
it is only the different understanding of that instrument that causes difficulty
the only dispute on both sides is
what are their rights
if the majority should not rule
who would be the judge
where is such a judge to be found
we should all be bound by the majority of the american people if not
then the minority must control
would that be right
would it be just or generous
assuredly not
i reiterate that the majority should rule
if i adopt a wrong policy
the opportunity for condemnation will occur in four years' time
then i can be turned out
and a better man with better views put in my place
address at pittsburgh
pennsylvania february 15
1861 i most cordially thank his honor mayor wilson
and the citizens of pittsburg generally
for their flattering reception
i am the more grateful because i know that it is not given to me alone
but to the cause i represent
which clearly proves to me their good will
and that sincere feeling is at the bottom of it
and here i may remark that in every short address i have made to the people
in every crowd through which i have passed of late
some allusion has been made to the present distracted condition of the country
it is natural to expect that i should say something on this subject but to touch upon it at all would involve an elaborate discussion of a great many questions and circumstances
requiring more time than i can at present command
and would
unnecessarily commit me upon matters which have not yet fully developed themselves
the condition of the country is an extraordinary one
and fills the mind of every patriot with anxiety
it is my intention to give this subject all the consideration i possibly can before specially deciding in regard to it
so that when i do speak it may be as nearly right as possible
when i do speak i hope i may say nothing in opposition to the spirit of the constitution
contrary to the integrity of the union
or which will prove inimical to the liberties of the people
or to the peace of the whole country
and furthermore
when the time arrives for me to speak on this great subject
i hope i may say nothing to disappoint the people generally throughout the country
especially if the expectation has been based upon anything which i may have heretofore said
notwithstanding the troubles across the river the speaker pointing southwardly across the monongahela
and smiling
there is no crisis but an artificial one
what is there now to warrant the condition of affairs presented by our friends over the river
take even their own view of the questions involved
and there is nothing to justify the course they are pursuing
i repeat
there is no crisis
excepting such a one as may be gotten up at any time by turbulent men aided by designing politicians
my advice to them
under such circumstances
is to keep cool
if the great american people only keep their temper on both sides of the line
the troubles will come to an end
and the question which now distracts the country will be settled
just as surely as all other difficulties of a like character which have originated in this government have been adjusted
let the people on both sides keep their self possession
and just as other clouds have cleared away in due time
so will this great nation continue to prosper as heretofore
i have spoken longer on this subject than i intended at the outset
it is often said that the tariff is the specialty of pennsylvania
assuming that direct taxation is not to be adopted
the tariff question must be as durable as the government itself
it is a question of national housekeeping
it is to the government what replenishing the meal tub is to the family
every varying circumstances will require frequent modifications as to the amount needed and the sources of supply
so far there is little difference of opinion among the people
it is as to whether
and how far
duties on imports shall be adjusted to favor home production in the home market
that controversy begins
one party insists that such adjustment oppresses one class for the advantage of another while the other party argues that
with all its incidents
in the long run all classes are benefited
in the chicago platform there is a plank upon this subject which should be a general law to the incoming administration
we should do neither more nor less than we gave the people reason to believe we would when they gave us their votes
permit me
to read the tariff plank of the chicago platform
or rather have it read in your hearing by one who has younger eyes
lincoln's private secretary then read section 12 of the chicago platform
as follows
that
while providing revenue for the support of the general government by duties upon imports
sound policy requires such an adjustment of these imposts as will encourage the development of the industrial interest of the whole country and we commend that policy of national exchanges which secures to working men liberal wages
to agriculture remunerating prices
to mechanics and manufacturers adequate return for their skill
and enterprise
and to the nation commercial prosperity and independence
as with all general propositions
there will be shades of difference in construing this
i have by no means a thoroughly matured judgment upon this subject
especially as to details some general ideas are about all
i have long thought it would be to our advantage to produce any necessary article at home which can be made of as good quality and with as little labor at home as abroad
at least by the difference of the carrying from abroad
in such case the carrying is demonstrably a dead loss of labor
for instance
labor being the true standard of value
is it not plain that if equal labor get a bar of railroad iron out of a mine in england and another out of a mine in pennsylvania
each can be laid down in a track at home cheaper than they could exchange countries
at least by the carriage
if there be a present cause why one can be both made and carried cheaper in money price than the other can be made without carrying
that cause is an unnatural and injurious one
and ought gradually
if not rapidly
to be removed
the condition of the treasury at this time would seem to render an early revision of the tariff indispensable
the morrill tariff bill
now pending before congress
may or may not become a law
i am not posted as to its particular provisions
but if they are generally satisfactory
and the bill shall now pass
there will be an end for the present
it shall not pass
i suppose the whole subject will be one of the most pressing and important for the next congress
by the constitution
the executive may recommend measures which he may think proper
and he may veto those he thinks improper
and it is supposed that he may add to these certain indirect influences to affect the action of congress
my political education strongly inclines me against a very free use of any of these means by the executive to control the legislation of the country
as a rule
i think it better that congress should originate as well as perfect its measures without external bias
i therefore would rather recommend to every gentleman who knows he is to be a member of the next congress to take an enlarged view
and post himself thoroughly
so as to contribute his part to such an adjustment of the tariff as shall produce a sufficient revenue
and in its other bearings
so far as possible
be just and equal to all sections of the country and classes of the people
address at cleveland
february 15
1861 mr
chairman and fellow citizens of cleveland
we have been marching about two miles through snow
and deep mud
the large numbers that have turned out under these circumstances testify that you are in earnest about something or other
but do i think so meanly of you as to suppose that that earnestness is about me personally
i would be doing you an injustice to suppose you did
you have assembled to testify your respect for the union
the constitution
and the laws and here let me say that it is with you
the people
to advance the great cause of the union and the constitution
and not with any one man
it rests with you alone
this fact is strongly impressed upon my mind at present
in a community like this
whose appearance testifies to their intelligence
i am convinced that the cause of liberty and the union can never be in danger
frequent allusion is made to the excitement at present existing in our national politics
and it is as well that i should also allude to it here
i think that there is no occasion for any excitement
the crisis
as it is called
is altogether an artificial crisis
in all parts of the nation there are differences of opinion on politics
there are differences of opinion even here
you did not all vote for the person who now addresses you
what is happening now will not hurt those who are farther away from here
have they not all their rights now as they ever have had
do they not have their fugitive slaves returned now as ever
have they not the same constitution that they have lived under for seventy odd years
have they not a position as citizens of this common country
and have we any power to change that position
is the matter with them
why all this excitement
why all these complaints
as i said before
this crisis is all artificial
it has no foundation in facts
it is not argued up
as the saying is
and cannot
be argued down
let it alone and it will go down of itself
lincoln then said that they must be content with a few words from him
as he was tired
having been given to understand that the crowd was not all republican
but consisted of men of all parties
he continued
this is as it should be
if judge douglas had been elected and had been here on his way to washington
as i am to night
the republicans should have joined his supporters in welcoming him
just as his friends have joined with mine tonight
if all do not join now to save the good old ship of the union this voyage
nobody will have a chance to pilot her on another voyage
address at buffalo
new york
february 16
1861 mr
mayor and fellow citizens of buffalo and the state of new york
i am here to thank you briefly for this grand reception given to me
not personally
but as the representative of our great and beloved country
your worthy mayor has been pleased to mention
in his address to me
the fortunate and agreeable journey which i have had from home
on my rather circuitous route to the federal capital
i am very happy that he was enabled in truth to congratulate myself and company on that fact
it is true we have had nothing thus far to mar the pleasure of the trip
we have not been met alone by those who assisted in giving the election to me i say not alone by them
but by the whole population of the country through which we have passed
this is as it should be
had the election fallen to any other of the distinguished candidates instead of myself
under the peculiar circumstances
to say the least
it would have been proper for all citizens to have greeted him as you now greet me
it is an evidence of the devotion of the whole people to the constitution
the union
and the perpetuity of the liberties of this country
i am unwilling on any occasion that i should be so meanly thought of as to have it supposed for a moment that these demonstrations are tendered to me personally
they are tendered to the country
to the institutions of the country
and to the perpetuity of the liberties of the country
for which these institutions were made and created
your worthy mayor has thought fit to express the hope that i may be able to relieve the country from the present
i should say
the threatened difficulties
i am sure i bring a heart true to the work
for the ability to perform it
i must trust in that supreme being who has never forsaken this favored land
through the instrumentality of this great and intelligent people
without that assistance i shall surely fail with it
i cannot fail
when we speak of threatened difficulties to the country
it is natural that it should be expected that something should be said by myself with regard to particular measures
upon more mature reflection
others will agree with me that
when it is considered that these difficulties are without precedent
and have never been acted upon by any individual situated as i am
it is most proper i should wait and see the developments
and get all the light possible
so that when i do speak authoritatively
i may be as near right as possible
when i shall speak authoritatively
i hope to say nothing inconsistent with the constitution
the union
the rights of all the states
of each state
and of each section of the country
and not to disappoint the reasonable expectations of those who have confided to me their votes
in this connection allow me to say that you
as a portion of the great american people
need only to maintain your composure
stand up to your sober convictions of right
to your obligations to the constitution
and act in accordance with those sober convictions
and the clouds now on the horizon will be dispelled
and we shall have a bright and glorious future and when this generation has passed away
tens of thousands will inhabit this country where only thousands inhabit it now
i do not propose to address you at length i have no voice for it
allow me again to thank you for this magnificent reception
and bid you farewell
address at rochester
new york
february 18
1861 i confess myself
after having seen many large audiences since leaving home
overwhelmed with this vast number of faces at this hour of the morning
i am not vain enough to believe that you are here from any wish to see me as an individual
but because i am for the time being the representative of the american people
i could not
if i would
address you at any length
i have not the strength
even if i had the time
for a speech at each of these many interviews that are afforded me on my way to washington
i appear merely to see you
and to let you see me
and to bid you farewell
i hope it will be understood that it is from no disinclination to oblige anybody that i do not address you at greater length
address at syracuse
new york
february 18
ladies and gentlemen
i see you have erected a very fine and handsome platform here for me
and i presume you expected me to speak from it
if i should go upon it
you would imagine that i was about to deliver you a much longer speech than i am
i wish you to understand that i mean no discourtesy to you by thus declining
i intend discourtesy to no one
but i wish you to understand that
though i am unwilling to go upon this platform
you are not at liberty to draw inferences concerning any other platform with which my name has been or is connected
i wish you long life and prosperity individually
and pray that with the perpetuity of those institutions under which we have all so long lived and prospered
our happiness may be secured
our future made brilliant
and the glorious destiny of our country established forever
i bid you a kind farewell
address at utica
new york
february 18
1860 ladies and gentlemen
i have no speech to make to you and no time to speak in
i appear before you that i may see you
and that you may see me and i am willing to admit that so far as the ladies are concerned i have the best of the bargain
though i wish it to be understood that i do not make the same acknowledgment concerning the men
reply to the mayor of albany
new york february 18
i can hardly appropriate to myself the flattering terms in which you communicate the tender of this reception
as personal to myself
i most gratefully accept the hospitalities tendered to me
and will not detain you or the audience with any extended remarks at this time
i presume that in the two or three courses through which i shall have to go
i shall have to repeat somewhat
and i will therefore only express to you my thanks for this kind reception
reply to governor morgan of new york
at albany
february 18
governor morgan
i was pleased to receive an invitation to visit the capital of the great empire state of this nation while on my way to the federal capital
i now thank you
and you
the people of the capital of the state of new york
for this most hearty and magnificent welcome
if i am not at fault
the great empire state at this time contains a larger population than did the whole of the united states of america at the time they achieved their national independence
and i was proud to be invited to visit its capital
to meet its citizens
as i now have the honor to do
i am notified by your governor that this reception is tendered by citizens without distinction of party
because of this i accept it the more gladly
in this country
and in any country where freedom of thought is tolerated
citizens attach themselves to political parties
it is but an ordinary degree of charity to attribute this act to the supposition that
in thus attaching themselves to the various parties
each man in his own judgment supposes he thereby best advances the interests of the whole country
and when an election is past it is altogether befitting a free people
as i suppose
until the next election
they should be one people
the reception you have extended me to day is not given to me personally
it should not be so
but as the representative
for the time being
of the majority of the nation
if the election had fallen to any of the more distinguished citizens who received the support of the people
this same honor should have greeted him that greets me this day
in testimony of the universal
unanimous devotion of the whole people to the constitution
the union
and to the perpetual liberties of succeeding generations in this country
i have neither the voice nor the strength to address you at any greater length
i beg you will therefore accept my most grateful thanks for this manifest devotion not to me
but the institutions of this great and glorious country
address to the legislature of new york
at albany
february 18
president and gentlemen of the general assembly of the state of new york
it is with feelings of great diffidence
i may say
with feelings of awe
perhaps greater than i have recently experienced
that i meet you here in this place
the history of this great state
the renown of those great men who have stood here
and have spoken here
and have been heard here
all crowd around my fancy
and incline me to shrink from any attempt to address you
yet i have some confidence given me by the generous manner in which you have invited me
and by the still more generous manner in which you have received me
to speak further
you have invited and received me without distinction of party
i cannot for a moment suppose that this has been done in any considerable degree with reference to my personal services
but that it is done in so far as i am regarded
at this time
as the representative of the majesty of this great nation
i doubt not this is the truth
and the whole truth of the case
and this is as it should be
it is much more gratifying to me that this reception has been given to me as the elected representative of a free people
than it could possibly be if tendered merely as an evidence of devotion to me
or to any one man personally
and now i think it were more fitting that i should close these hasty remarks
it is true that
while i hold myself
without mock modesty
the humblest of all individuals that have ever been elevated to the presidency
i have a more difficult task to perform than any one of them
you have generously tendered me the support the united support of the great empire state
for this
in behalf of the nation in behalf of the present and future of the nation in behalf of civil and religious liberty for all time to come
most gratefully do i thank you
i do not propose to enter into an explanation of any particular line of policy
as to our present difficulties
to be adopted by the incoming administration
i deem it just to you
to myself
to all
that i should see everything
that i should hear everything
that i should have every light that can be brought within my reach
in order that
when i do so speak
i shall have enjoyed every opportunity to take correct and true ground and for this reason i do not propose to speak at this time of the policy of the government
but when the time comes
i shall speak
as well as i am able
for the good of the present and future of this country for the good both of the north and of the south for the good of the one and the other
and of all sections of the country
in the meantime
if we have patience
if we restrain ourselves
if we allow ourselves not to run off in a passion
i still have confidence that the almighty
the maker of the universe
through the instrumentality of this great and intelligent people
bring us through this as he has through all the other difficulties of our country
relying on this
i again thank you for this generous reception
address at troy
new york
february 19
1861 mr
mayor and citizens of troy
i thank you very kindly for this great reception
since i left my home it has not been my fortune to meet an assemblage more numerous and more orderly than this
i am the more gratified at this mark of your regard since you assure me it is tendered
not to the individual but to the high office you have called me to fill
i have neither strength nor time to make any extended remarks on this occasion
and i can only repeat to you my sincere thanks for the kind reception you have thought proper to extend to me
address at poughkeepsie
new york
february 19
1861 fellow citizens
it is altogether impossible i should make myself heard by any considerable portion of this vast assemblage but
although i appear before you mainly for the purpose of seeing you
and to let you see rather than hear me
i cannot refrain from saying that i am highly gratified as much here
under the circumstances
as i have been anywhere on my route to witness this noble demonstration made
not in honor of an individual
but of the man who at this time humbly
but earnestly
represents the majesty of the nation
this reception
like all the others that have been tendered to me
doubtless emanates from all the political parties
and not from one alone
as such i accept it the more gratefully
since it indicates an earnest desire on the part of the whole people
with out regard to political differences
to save not the country
because the country will save itself but to save the institutions of the country
those institutions under which
in the last three quarters of a century
we have grown to a great
and intelligent
and a happy people the greatest
the most intelligent
and the happiest people in the world
these noble manifestations indicate
with unerring certainty
that the whole people are willing to make common cause for this object that if
as it ever must be
some have been successful in the recent election and some have been beaten
if some are satisfied and some are dissatisfied
the defeated party are not in favor of sinking the ship
but are desirous of running it through the tempest in safety
and willing
if they think the people have committed an error in their verdict now
to wait in the hope of reversing it and setting it right next time
i do not say that in the recent election the people did the wisest thing
that could have been done indeed
i do not think they did but i do say that in accepting the great trust committed to me
which i do with a determination to endeavor to prove worthy of it
i must rely upon you
upon the people of the whole country
for support and with their sustaining aid
even i
humble as i am
cannot fail to carry the ship of state safely through the storm
i have now only to thank you warmly for your kind attendance
and bid you all an affectionate farewell
address at hudson
new york
february 19
1860 fellow citizens
i see that you are providing a platform for me
i shall have to decline standing upon it
because the president of the company tells me that i shall not have time to wait until it is brought to me
as i said yesterday
under similar circumstances at another gathering
you must not draw the inference that i have any intention of deserting any platform with which i have a legitimate connection because i do not stand on yours
allow me to thank you for this splendid reception
and i now bid you farewell
address at peekskill
new york
february 19
1861 ladies and gentlemen
i have but a moment to stand before you to listen to and return your kind greeting
i thank you for this reception
and for the pleasant manner in which it is tendered to me by our mutual friends
i will say in a single sentence
in regard to the difficulties that lie before me and our beloved country
that if i can only be as generously and unanimously sustained as the demonstrations i have witnessed indicate i shall be
i shall not fail but without your sustaining hands i am sure that neither i nor any other man can hope to surmount these difficulties
i trust that in the course i shall pursue i shall be sustained not only by the party that elected me
but by the patriotic people of the whole country
address at fishkill landing february 19
1861 ladies and gentlemen
i appear before you not to make a speech
i have not sufficient time
if i had the strength
to repeat speeches at every station where the people kindly gather to welcome me as we go along
if i had the strength
and should take the time
i should not get to washington until after the inauguration
which you must be aware would not fit exactly
that such an untoward event might not transpire
i know you will readily forego any further remarks and i close by bidding you farewell
remarks at the astor house
new york city
february 19
1861 fellow citizens
i have stepped before you merely in compliance with what appears to be your wish
and not with the purpose of making a speech
i do not propose making a speech this afternoon
i could not be heard by any but a small fraction of you
at best but
what is still worse than that
i have nothing just now to say that is worthy of your hearing
i beg you to believe that i do not now refuse to address you from any disposition to disoblige you
but to the contrary
at the same time
i beg of you to excuse me for the present
address at new york city
february 19
1861 mr
chairman and gentlemen
i am rather an old man to avail myself of such an excuse as i am now about to do
yet the truth is so distinct
and presses itself so distinctly upon me
that i cannot well avoid it and that is
that i did not understand when i was brought into this room that i was to be brought here to make a speech
it was not intimated to me that i was brought into the room where daniel webster and henry clay had made speeches
and where one in my position might be expected to do something like those men or say something worthy of myself or my audience
i therefore beg you to make allowance for the circumstances in which i have been by surprise brought before you
now i have been in the habit of thinking and sometimes speaking upon political questions that have for some years past agitated the country and
if i were disposed to do so
and we could take up some one of the issues
as the lawyers call them
and i were called upon to make an argument about it to the best of my ability
i could do so without much preparation
but that is not what you desire to have done here to night
i have been occupying a position
since the presidential election
of silence of avoiding public speaking
of avoiding public writing
i have been doing so because i thought
upon full consideration
that was the proper course for me to take
i am brought before you now
and required to make a speech
when you all approve more than anything else of the fact that i have been keeping silence
and now it seems to me that the response you give to that remark ought to justify me in closing just here
i have not kept silence since the presidential election from any party wantonness
or from any indifference to the anxiety that pervades the minds of men about the aspect of the political affairs of this country
i have kept silence for the reason that i supposed it was peculiarly proper that i should do so until the time came when
according to the custom of the country
i could speak officially
i still suppose that
while the political drama being enacted in this country at this time is rapidly shifting its scenes forbidding an anticipation with any degree of certainty to day of what we shall see to morrow it is peculiarly fitting that i should see it all
up to the last minute
before i should take ground that i might be disposed
by the shifting of the scenes afterward
also to shift
i have said several times upon this journey
and i now repeat it to you
that when the time does come
i shall then take the ground that i think is right right for the north
for the south
for the east
for the west
for the whole country
and in doing so i hope to feel no necessity pressing upon me to say anything in conflict with the constitution
in conflict with the continued union of these states
in conflict with the perpetuation of the liberties of this people
or anything in conflict with anything whatever that i have ever given you reason to expect from me
and now
my friends
have i said enough
loud cries of no
and
three cheers for lincoln
now
my friends
there appears to be a difference of opinion between you and me
and i really feel called upon to decide the question myself
reply to the mayor of new york city
february 20
1861 mr
it is with feelings of deep gratitude that i make my acknowledgments for the reception that has been given me in the great commercial city of new york
i cannot but remember that it is done by the people who do not
by a large majority
agree with me in political sentiment
it is the more grateful to me because in this i see that for the great principles of our government the people are pretty nearly or quite unanimous
in regard to the difficulties that confront us at this time
and of which you have seen fit to speak so becomingly and so justly
i can only say i agree with the sentiments expressed
in my devotion to the union i hope i am behind no man in the nation
as to my wisdom in conducting affairs so as to tend to the preservation of the union
i fear too great confidence may have been placed in me
i am sure i bring a heart devoted to the work
there is nothing that could ever bring me to consent willingly to consent to the destruction of this union in which not only the great city of new york
but the whole country
has acquired its greatness
unless it would be that thing for which the union itself was made
i understand that the ship is made for the carrying and preservation of the cargo and so long as the ship is safe with the cargo
it shall not be abandoned
this union shall never be abandoned
unless the possibility of its existence shall cease to exist without the necessity of throwing passengers and cargo overboard
so long
as it is possible that the prosperity and liberties of this people can be preserved within this union
it shall be my purpose at all tunes to preserve it
and now
renewing my thanks for this cordial reception
allow me to come to a close
address at jersey city
new jersey february 21
1860 mr
dayton and gentlemen of the state of new jersey
i shall only thank you briefly for this very kind reception given me
not personally
but as the temporary representative of the majesty of the nation
to the kindness of your hearts
and of the hearts of your brethren in your state
i should be very proud to respond
but i shall not have strength to address you or other assemblages at length
even if i had the time to do so
i appear before you
for little else than to greet you
and to briefly say farewell
you have done me the very high honor to present your reception courtesies to me through your great man a man with whom it is an honor to be associated anywhere
and in owning whom no state can be poor
he has said enough
and by the saying of it suggested enough
to require a response of an hour
well considered
i could not in an hour make a worthy response to it
i therefore
ladies and gentlemen of new jersey
content myself with saying
most heartily do i indorse all the sentiments he has expressed
allow me
most gratefully
to bid you farewell
reply to the mayor of newark
new jersey
february 21
i thank you for this reception at the city of newark
with regard to the great work of which you speak
i will say that i bring to it a heart filled with love for my country
and an honest desire to do what is right
i am sure
that i have not the ability to do anything unaided of god
and that without his support and that of this free
and intelligent people
no man can succeed in doing that the importance of which we all comprehend
again thanking you for the reception you have given me
i will now bid you farewell
and proceed upon my journey
address in trenton at the trenton house
february 21
1861 i have been invited by your representatives to the legislature to visit this the capital of your honored state
and in acknowledging their kind invitation
compelled to respond to the welcome of the presiding officers of each body
and i suppose they intended i should speak to you through them
as they are the representatives of all of you and if i were to speak again here
i should only have to repeat in a great measure much that i have said
which would be disgusting to my friends around me who have met here
i have no speech to make
but merely appear to see you and let you look at me and as to the latter i think i have greatly the best of the bargain
my friends
allow me to bid you farewell
address to the senate of new jersey february 21
1861 mr
president and gentlemen of the senate of the state of new jersey
i am very grateful to you for the honorable reception of which i have been the object
i cannot but remember the place that new jersey holds in our early history
in the revolutionary struggle few of the states among the old thirteen had more of the battle fields of the country within their limits than new jersey
may i be pardoned if
upon this occasion
i mention that away back in my childhood
the earliest days of my being able to read
i got hold of a small book
such a one as few of the younger members have ever seen weems's life of washington
i remember all the accounts there given of the battle fields and struggles for the liberties of the country and none fixed themselves upon my imagination so deeply as the struggle here at trenton
new jersey
the crossing of the river
the contest with the hessians
the great hardships endured at that time
all fixed themselves on my memory more than any single revolutionary event and you all know
for you have all been boys
how these early impressions last longer than any others
i recollect thinking then
boy even though i was
that there must have been something more than common that these men struggled for
i am exceedingly anxious that that thing that something even more than national independence
that something that held out a great promise to all the people of the world to all time to come i am exceedingly anxious that this union
the constitution
and the liberties of the people shall be perpetuated in accordance with the original idea for which that struggle was made and i shall be most happy indeed if i shall be a humble instrument in the hands of the almighty
and of this his almost chosen people
for perpetuating the object of that great struggle
you give me this reception
as i understand
without distinction of party
i learn that this body is composed of a majority of gentlemen who
in the exercise of their best judgment in the choice of a chief magistrate
did not think i was the man
i understand
that they come forward here to greet me as the constitutionally elected president of the united states as citizens of the united states to meet the man who
for the time being
is the representative of the majesty of the nation united by the single purpose to perpetuate the constitution
the union
and the liberties of the people
as such
i accept this reception more gratefully than i could do did i believe it were tendered to me as an individual
address to the assembly of new jersey
february 21
1861 mr
speaker and gentlemen
i have just enjoyed the honor of a reception by the other branch of this legislature
and i return to you and them my thanks for the reception which the people of new jersey have given through their chosen representatives to me as the representative
for the time being
of the majesty of the people of the united states
i appropriate to myself very little of the demonstrations of respect with which i have been greeted
i think little should be given to any man
but that it should be a manifestation of adherence to the union and the constitution
i understand myself to be received here by the representatives of the people of new jersey
a majority of whom differ in opinion from those with whom i have acted
this manifestation is therefore to be regarded by me as expressing their devotion to the union
the constitution
and the liberties of the people
have well said that this is a time when the bravest and wisest look with doubt and awe upon the aspect presented by our national affairs
under these circumstances you will readily see why i should not speak in detail of the course i shall deem it best to pursue
it is proper that i should avail myself of all the information and all the time at my command
in order that when the time arrives in which i must speak officially
i shall be able to take the ground which i deem best and safest
and from which i may have no occasion to swerve
i shall endeavor to take the ground i deem most just to the north
the east
the west
the south
and the whole country
i shall take it
i hope
in good temper
certainly with no malice toward any section
i shall do all that may be in my power to promote a peaceful settlement of all our difficulties
the man does not live who is more devoted to peace than i am
none who would do more to preserve it
but it may be necessary to put the foot down firmly
and if i do my duty and do right
you will sustain me
will you not
loud cheers
and cries of yes
yes we will
received as i am by the members of a legislature the majority of whom do not agree with me in political sentiments
i trust that i may have their assistance in piloting the ship of state through this voyage
surrounded by perils as it is for if it should suffer wreck now
there will be no pilot ever needed for another voyage
i have already spoken longer than i intended
and must beg leave to stop here
reply to the mayor of philadelphia
february 21
1861 mr
mayor and fellow citizens of philadelphia
i appear before you to make no lengthy speech
but to thank you for this reception
the reception you have given me to night is not to me
the man
the individual
but to the man who temporarily represents
or should represent
the majesty of the nation
it is true
as your worthy mayor has said
that there is great anxiety amongst the citizens of the united states at this time
i deem it a happy circumstance that this dissatisfied portion of our fellow citizens does not point us to anything in which they are being injured or about to be injured for which reason i have felt all the while justified in concluding that the crisis
the panic
the anxiety of the country at this time is artificial
if there be those who differ with me upon this subject
they have not pointed out the substantial difficulty that exists
i do not mean to say that an artificial panic may not do considerable harm that it has done such i do not deny
the hope that has been expressed by your mayor
that i may be able to restore peace
and prosperity to the country
is most worthy of him and most happy
will i be if i shall be able to verify and fulfil that hope
i promise you that i bring to the work a sincere heart
whether i will bring a head equal to that heart will be for future times to determine
it were useless for me to speak of details of plans now i shall speak officially next monday week
if ever
if i should not speak then
it were useless for me to do so now
if i do speak then
it is useless for me to do so now
when i do speak
i shall take such ground as i deem best calculated to restore peace
and prosperity to the country
and tend to the perpetuity of the nation and the liberty of these states and these people
your worthy mayor has expressed the wish
in which i join with him
that it were convenient for me to remain in your city long enough to consult your merchants and manufacturers or
as it were
to listen to those breathings rising within the consecrated walls wherein the constitution of the united states and
i will add
the declaration of independence
were originally framed and adopted
i assure you and your mayor that i had hoped on this occasion
and upon all occasions during my life
that i shall do nothing inconsistent with the teachings of these holy and most sacred walls
i have never asked anything that does not breathe from those walls
all my political warfare has been in favor of the teachings that come forth from these sacred walls
may my right hand forget its cunning and my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth if ever i prove false to those teachings
i have addressed you longer than i expected to do
and now allow me to bid you goodnight
address in the hall of independence
february 22
1861 mr
i am filled with deep emotion at finding myself standing here
in this place
where were collected together the wisdom
the devotion to principle
from which sprang the institutions under which we live
you have kindly suggested to me that in my hands is the task of restoring peace to the present distracted condition of the country
i can say in return
that all the political sentiments i entertain have been drawn
so far as i have been able to draw them
from the sentiments which originated and were given to the world from this hall
i have never had a feeling politically that did not spring from the sentiments embodied in the declaration of independence
i have often pondered over the dangers which were incurred by the men who assembled here and framed and adopted that declaration of independence
i have pondered over the toils that were endured by the officers and soldiers of the army who achieved that independence
i have often inquired of myself what great principle or idea it was that kept the confederacy so long together
it was not the mere matter of separation of the colonies from the motherland
but that sentiment in the declaration of independence which gave liberty
not alone to the people of this country
i hope
to the world for all future time
it was that which gave promise that in due time the weight would be lifted from the shoulders of all men
this is the sentiment embodied in the declaration of independence
my friends
can the country be saved upon that basis
if it can
i will consider myself one of the happiest men in the world if i can help to save it
if it cannot be saved upon that principle
it will be truly awful
but if this country cannot be saved without giving up that principle
i was about to say i would rather be assassinated on this spot than surrender it
in my view of the present aspect of affairs
there need be no bloodshed or war
there is no necessity for it
i am not in favor of such a course
and i may say
in advance
that there will be no bloodshed unless it is forced upon the government
and then it will be compelled to act in self defence
my friends this is wholly an unexpected speech
and i did not expect to be called upon to say a word when i came here
i supposed it was merely to do something toward raising the flag
i may
have said something indiscreet
i have said nothing but what i am willing to live by and
if it be the pleasure of almighty god
die by
reply to the wilmington delegation
february 22
1861 mr
i feel highly flattered by the encomiums you have seen fit to bestow upon me
soon after the nomination of general taylor
i attended a political meeting in the city of wilmington
and have since carried with me a fond remembrance of the hospitalities of the city on that occasion
the programme established provides for my presence in harrisburg in twenty four hours from this time
i expect to be in washington on saturday
it is
an impossibility that i should accept your kind invitation
there are no people whom i would more gladly accommodate than those of delaware but circumstances forbid
with many regrets for the character of the reply i am compelled to give you
i bid you adieu
address at lancaster
february 22
1860 ladies and gentlemen of old lancaster
i appear not to make a speech
i have not time to make a speech at length
and not strength to make them on every occasion and
worse than all
i have none to make
there is plenty of matter to speak about in these times
but it is well known that the more a man speaks the less he is understood the more he says one thing
the more his adversaries contend he meant something else
i shall soon have occasion to speak officially
and then i will endeavor to put my thoughts just as plain as i can express myself true to the constitution and union of all the states
and to the perpetual liberty of all the people
until i so speak
there is no need to enter upon details
in conclusion
i greet you most heartily
and bid you an affectionate farewell
address to the legislature of pennsylvania
at harrisburg
february 22
1861 mr
speaker of the senate
and also mr
speaker of the house of representatives
and gentlemen of the general assembly of the state of pennsylvania
i appear before you only for a very few brief remarks in response to what has been said to me
i thank you most sincerely for this reception
and the generous words in which support has been promised me upon this occasion
i thank your great commonwealth for the overwhelming support it recently gave
not me personally
but the cause which i think a just one
in the late election
allusion has been made to the fact the interesting fact perhaps we should say that i for the first time appear at the capital of the great commonwealth of pennsylvania upon the birthday of the father of his country
in connection with that beloved anniversary connected with the history of this country
i have already gone through one exceedingly interesting scene this morning in the ceremonies at philadelphia
under the kind conduct of gentlemen there
i was for the first time allowed the privilege of standing in old independence hall to have a few words addressed to me there
and opening up to me an opportunity of manifesting my deep regret that i had not more time to express something of my own feelings excited by the occasion
that had been really the feelings of my whole life
besides this
our friends there had provided a magnificent flag of the country
they had arranged it so that i was given the honor of raising it to the head of its staff
and when it went up i was pleased that it went to its place by the strength of my own feeble arm
according to the arrangement
the cord was pulled
and it floated gloriously to the wind
without an accident
in the bright
glowing sunshine of the morning
i could not help hoping that there was in the entire success of that beautiful ceremony at least something of an omen of what is to come
nor could i help feeling then
as i have often felt
that in the whole of that proceeding i was a very humbled instrument
i had not provided the flag i had not made the arrangements for elevating it to its place i had applied but a very small portion of even my feeble strength in raising it
in the whole transaction i was in the hands of the people who had arranged it
and if i can have the same generous co operation of the people of this nation
i think the flag of our country may yet be kept flaunting gloriously
i recur for a moment but to repeat some words uttered at the hotel in regard to what has been said about the military support which the general government may expect from the commonwealth of pennsylvania in a proper emergency
to guard against any possible mistake do i recur to this
it is not with any pleasure that i contemplate the possibility that a necessity may arise in this country for the use of the military arm
while i am exceedingly gratified to see the manifestation upon your streets of your military force here
and exceedingly gratified at your promise to use that force upon a proper emergency while i make these acknowledgments i desire to repeat
in order to preclude any possible misconstruction
that i do most sincerely hope that we shall have no use for them that it will never become their duty to shed blood
and most especially never to shed fraternal blood
i promise that so far as i may have wisdom to direct
if so painful a result shall in any wise be brought about
it shall be through no fault of mine
allusion has also been made by one of your honored speakers to some remarks recently made by myself at pittsburg in regard to what is supposed to be the especial interest of this great commonwealth of pennsylvania
i now wish only to say in regard to that matter
that the few remarks which i uttered on that occasion were rather carefully worded
i took pains that they should be so
i have seen no occasion since to add to them or subtract from them
i leave them precisely as they stand
adding only now that i am pleased to have an expression from you
gentlemen of pennsylvania
signifying that they are satisfactory to you
and now
gentlemen of the general assembly of the commonwealth of pennsylvania
allow me again to return to you my most sincere thanks
reply to the mayor of washington
february 27
1861 mr
i thank you
and through you the municipal authorities of this city who accompany you
for this welcome
and as it is the first time in my life
since the present phase of politics has presented itself in this country
that i have said anything publicly within a region of country where the institution of slavery exists
i will take this occasion to say that i think very much of the ill feeling that has existed and still exists between the people in the section from which i came and the people here
is dependent upon a misunderstanding of one another
i therefore avail myself of this opportunity to assure you
and all the gentlemen present
that i have not now
and never have had
any other than as kindly feelings toward you as to the people of my own section
i have not now
and never have had
any disposition to treat you in any respect otherwise than as my own neighbors
i have not now any purpose to withhold from you any of the benefits of the constitution
under any circumstances
that i would not feel myself constrained to withhold from my own neighbors and i hope
in a word
that when we shall become better acquainted and i say it with great confidence we shall like each other better
i thank you for the kindness of this reception
reply to a serenade at washington
february 28
1861 my friends
i suppose that i may take this as a compliment paid to me
and as such please accept my thanks for it
i have reached this city of washington under circumstances considerably differing from those under which any other man has ever reached it
i am here for the purpose of taking an official position amongst the people
almost all of whom were politically opposed to me
and are yet opposed to me
as i suppose
i propose no lengthy address to you
i only propose to say
as i did on yesterday
when your worthy mayor and board of aldermen called upon me
that i thought much of the ill feeling that has existed between you and the people of your surroundings and that people from among whom i came
has depended
and now depends
upon a misunderstanding
i hope that
if things shall go along as prosperously as i believe we all desire they may
i may have it in my power to remove something of this misunderstanding that i may be enabled to convince you
and the people of your section of the country
that we regard you as in all things our equals
and in all things entitled to the same respect and the same treatment that we claim for ourselves that we are in no wise disposed
if it were in our power
to oppress you
to deprive you of any of your rights under the constitution of the united states
or even narrowly to split hairs with you in regard to these rights
but are determined to give you
as far as lies in our hands
all your rights under the constitution not grudgingly
but fully and fairly
i hope that
by thus dealing with you
we will become better acquainted
and be better friends
and now
my friends
with these few remarks
and again returning my thanks for this compliment
and expressing my desire to hear a little more of your good music
i bid you good night
march 3
1861 during the struggle over the appointments of lincoln's cabinet
the president elect spoke as follows
gentlemen
it is evident that some one must take the responsibility of these appointments
and i will do it
my cabinet is completed
the positions are not definitely assigned
and will not be until i announce them privately to the gentlemen whom i have selected as my constitutional advisers
first inaugural address
march 4
1861 fellow citizens of the united states
in compliance with a custom as old as the government itself
i appear before you to address you briefly
and to take in your presence the oath prescribed by the constitution of the united states to be taken by the president before he enters on the execution of his office
i do not consider it necessary at present for me to discuss those matters of administration about which there is no special anxiety or excitement
apprehension seems to exist among the people of the southern states that by the accession of a republican administration their property and their peace and personal security are to be endangered
there has never been any reasonable cause for such apprehension
the most ample evidence to the contrary has all the while existed and been open to their inspection
it is found in nearly all the published speeches of him who now addresses you
i do but quote from one of those speeches when i declare that i have no purpose
directly or indirectly
to interfere with the institution of slavery in the states where it exists
i believe i have no lawful right to do so
and i have no inclination to do so
those who nominated and elected me did so with full knowledge that i had made this and many similar declarations
and had never recanted them
more than this
they placed in the platform for my acceptance
and as a law to themselves and to me
the clear and emphatic resolution which i now read
that the maintenance inviolate of the rights of the states
and especially the right of each state to order and control its own domestic institutions according to its own judgment exclusively
is essential to that balance of power on which the perfection and endurance of our political fabric depend
and we denounce the lawless invasion by armed force of the soil of any state or territory
no matter under what pretext
as amongst the gravest of crimes
i now reiterate these sentiments and
in doing so
i only press upon the public attention the most conclusive evidence of which the case is susceptible
that the property
and security of no section are to be in any wise endangered by the now incoming administration
i add
that all the protection which
consistently with the constitution and the laws
can be given
will be cheerfully given to all the states when lawfully demanded
for whatever cause as cheerfully to one section as to another
there is much controversy about the delivering up of fugitives from service or labor
the clause i now read is as plainly written in the constitution as any other of its provisions
no person held to service or labor in one state
under the laws thereof
escaping into another
shall in consequence of any law or regulation therein be discharged from such service or labor
but shall be delivered up on claim of the party to whom such service or labor may be due
it is scarcely questioned that this provision was intended by those who made it for the reclaiming of what we call fugitive slaves and the intention of the lawgiver is the law
all members of congress swear their support to the whole constitution to this provision as much as to any other
to the proposition
that slaves whose cases come within the terms of this clause shall be delivered up
their oaths are unanimous
if they would make the effort in good temper
could they not with nearly equal unanimity frame and pass a law by means of which to keep good that unanimous oath
there is some difference of opinion whether this clause should be enforced by national or by state authority but surely that difference is not a very material one
if the slave is to be surrendered
it can be of but little consequence to him or to others by which authority it is done
and should any one in any case be content that his oath shall go unkept on a merely unsubstantial controversy as to how it shall be kept
in any law upon this subject
ought not all the safeguards of liberty known in civilized and humane jurisprudence to be introduced
so that a free man be not
in any case
surrendered as a slave
and might it not be well at the same time to provide by law for the enforcement of that clause in the constitution which guarantees that the citizens of each state shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of citizens in the several states
i take the official oath to day with no mental reservations
and with no purpose to construe the constitution or laws by any hypercritical rules
while i do not choose now to specify particular acts of congress as proper to be enforced
i do suggest that it will be much safer for all
both in official and private stations
to conform to and abide by all those acts which stand unrepealed
than to violate any of them
trusting to find impunity in having them held to be unconstitutional
it is seventy two years since the first inauguration of a president under our national constitution
during that period fifteen different and greatly distinguished citizens have
in succession
administered the executive branch of the government
they have conducted it through many perils
and generally with great success
with all this scope of precedent
i now enter upon the same task for the brief constitutional term of four years under great and peculiar difficulty
a disruption of the federal union
heretofore only menaced
is now formidably attempted
i hold that
in contemplation of universal law and of the constitution
the union of these states is perpetual
perpetuity is implied
if not expressed
in the fundamental law of all national governments
it is safe to assert that no government proper ever had a provision in its organic law for its own termination
continue to execute all the express provisions of our national constitution
and the union will endure forever it being impossible to destroy it except by some action not provided for in the instrument itself
if the united states be not a government proper
but an association of states in the nature of contract merely
can it as a contract be peaceably unmade by less than all the parties who made it
one party to a contract may violate it break it
so to speak but does it not require all to lawfully rescind it
descending from these general principles
we find the proposition that in legal contemplation the union is perpetual confirmed by the history of the union itself
the union is much older than the constitution
it was formed
in fact
by the articles of association in 1774
it was matured and continued by the declaration of independence in 1776
it was further matured
and the faith of all the then thirteen states expressly plighted and engaged that it should be perpetual
by the articles of confederation in 1778
in 1787 one of the declared objects for ordaining and establishing the constitution was to form a more perfect union
but if the destruction of the union by one or by a part only of the states be lawfully possible
the union is less perfect than before the constitution
having lost the vital element of perpetuity
it follows from these views that no state upon its own mere motion can lawfully get out of the union that resolves and ordinances to that effect are legally void and that acts of violence
within any state or states
against the authority of the united states
are insurrectionary or revolutionary
according to circumstances
i therefore consider that
in view of the constitution and the laws
the union is unbroken and to the extent of my ability i shall take care
as the constitution itself expressly enjoins upon me
that the laws of the union be faithfully executed in all the states
doing this i deem to be only a simple duty on my part and i shall perform it so far as practicable
unless my rightful masters
the american people
shall withhold the requisite means
or in some authoritative manner direct the contrary
i trust this will not be regarded as a menace
but only as the declared purpose of the union that it will constitutionally defend and maintain itself
in doing this there needs to be no bloodshed or violence and there shall be none
unless it be forced upon the national authority
the power confided to me will be used to hold
and possess the property and places belonging to the government
and to collect the duties and imposts but beyond what may be necessary for these objects
there will be no invasion
no using of force against or among the people anywhere
where hostility to the united states
in any interior locality
shall be so great and universal as to prevent competent resident citizens from holding the federal offices
there will be no attempt to force obnoxious strangers among the people for that object
while the strict legal right may exist in the government to enforce the exercise of these offices
the attempt to do so would be so irritating
and so nearly impracticable withal
that i deem it better to forego for the time the uses of such offices
the mails
unless repelled
will continue to be furnished in all parts of the union
so far as possible
the people everywhere shall have that sense of perfect security which is most favorable to calm thought and reflection
the course here indicated will be followed unless current events and experience shall show a modification or change to be proper
and in every case and exigency my best discretion will be exercised according to circumstances actually existing
and with a view and a hope of a peaceful solution of the national troubles and the restoration of fraternal sympathies and affections
that there are persons in one section or another who seek to destroy the union at all events
and are glad of any pretext to do it
i will neither affirm nor deny but if there be such
i need address no word to them
to those
who really love the union may i not speak
before entering upon so grave a matter as the destruction of our national fabric
with all its benefits
its memories
and its hopes
would it not be wise to ascertain precisely why we do it
will you hazard so desperate a step while there is any possibility that any portion of the ills you fly from have no real existence
will you
while the certain ills you fly to are greater than all the real ones you fly from will you risk the commission of so fearful a mistake
all profess to be content in the union if all constitutional rights can be maintained
is it true
that any right
plainly written in the constitution
has been denied
i think not
happily the human mind is so constituted that no party can reach to the audacity of doing this
if you can
of a single instance in which a plainly written provision of the constitution has ever been denied
if by the mere force of numbers a majority should deprive a minority of any clearly written constitutional right
it might
in a moral point of view
justify revolution certainly would if such a right were a vital one
but such is not our case
all the vital rights of minorities and of individuals are so plainly assured to them by affirmations and negations
guaranties and prohibitions
in the constitution
that controversies never arise concerning them
but no organic law can ever be framed with a provision specifically applicable to every question which may occur in practical administration
no foresight can anticipate
nor any document of reasonable length contain
express provisions for all possible questions
shall fugitives from labor be surrendered by national or by state authority
the constitution does not expressly say
may congress prohibit slavery in the territories
the constitution does not expressly say
must congress protect slavery in the territories
the constitution does not expressly say
from questions of this class spring all our constitutional controversies
and we divide upon them into majorities and minorities
if the minority will not acquiesce
the majority must
or the government must cease
there is no other alternative for continuing the government is acquiescence on one side or the other
if a minority in such case will secede rather than acquiesce
they make a precedent which in turn will divide and ruin them for a minority of their own will secede from them whenever a majority refuses to be controlled by such minority
for instance
why may not any portion of a new confederacy a year or two hence arbitrarily secede again
precisely as portions of the present union now claim to secede from it
all who cherish disunion sentiments are now being educated to the exact temper of doing this
is there such perfect identity of interests among the states to compose a new union as to produce harmony only
and prevent renewed secession
the central idea of secession is the essence of anarchy
a majority held in restraint by constitutional checks and limitations
and always changing easily with deliberate changes of popular opinions and sentiments
is the only true sovereign of a free people
whoever rejects it does
of necessity
fly to anarchy or to despotism
unanimity is impossible the rule of a minority
as a permanent arrangement
is wholly inadmissible so that
rejecting the majority principle
anarchy or despotism in some form is all that is left
i do not forget the position assumed by some
that constitutional questions are to be decided by the supreme court nor do i deny that such decisions must be binding
in any case
upon the parties to a suit
as to the object of that suit
while they are also entitled to very high respect and consideration in all parallel cases by all other departments of the government
while it is obviously possible that such decision may be erroneous in any given case
still the evil effect following it
being limited to that particular case
with the chance that it may be overruled and never become a precedent for other cases
can better be borne than could the evils of a different practice
at the same time
the candid citizen must confess that if the policy of the government
upon vital questions affecting the whole people
is to be irrevocably fixed by decisions of the supreme court
the instant they are made
in ordinary litigation between parties in personal actions
the people will have ceased to be their own rulers
having to that extent practically resigned the government into the hands of that eminent tribunal
nor is there in this view any assault upon the court or the judges
it is a duty from which they may not shrink to decide cases properly brought before them
and it is no fault of theirs if others seek to turn their decisions to political purposes
one section of our country believes slavery is right
and ought to be extended
while the other believes it is wrong
and ought not to be extended
this is the only substantial dispute
the fugitive slave clause of the constitution and the law for the suppression of the foreign slave trade are each as well enforced
as any law can ever be in a community where the moral sense of the people imperfectly supports the law itself
the great body of the people abide by the dry legal obligation in both cases
and a few break over in each
i think
cannot be perfectly cured and it would be worse in both cases after the separation of the sections than before
the foreign slave trade
now imperfectly suppressed
would be ultimately revived
without restriction
in one section
while fugitive slaves
now only partially surrendered
would not be surrendered at all by the other
physically speaking
we cannot separate
we cannot remove our respective sections from each other
nor build an impassable wall between them
a husband and wife may be divorced and go out of the presence and beyond the reach of each other but the different parts of our country cannot do this
they cannot but remain face to face
and intercourse
either amicable or hostile
must continue between them
is it possible
to make that intercourse more advantageous or more satisfactory after separation than before
can aliens make treaties easier than friends can make laws
can treaties be more faithfully enforced between aliens than laws can among friends
suppose you go to war
you cannot fight always and when
after much loss on both sides
and no gain on either
you cease fighting
the identical old questions as to terms of intercourse are again upon you
this country
with its institutions
belongs to the people who inhabit it
whenever they shall grow weary of the existing government
they can exercise their constitutional right of amending it
or their revolutionary right to dismember or overthrow it
i cannot be ignorant of the fact that many worthy and patriotic citizens are desirous of having the national constitution amended
while i make no recommendation of amendments
i fully recognize the rightful authority of the people over the whole subject
to be exercised in either of the modes prescribed in the instrument itself
and i should
under existing circumstances
favor rather than oppose a fair opportunity being afforded the people to act upon it
i will venture to add that to me the convention mode seems preferable
in that it allows amendments to originate with the people themselves
instead of only permitting them to take or reject propositions originated by others not especially chosen for the purpose
and which might not be precisely such as they would wish to either accept or refuse
i understand a proposed amendment to the constitution which amendment
i have not seen has passed congress
to the effect that the federal government shall never interfere with the domestic institutions of the states
including that of persons held to service
to avoid misconstruction of what i have said
i depart from my purpose not to speak of particular amendments so far as to say that
holding such a provision to now be implied constitutional law
i have no objection to its being made express and irrevocable
the chief magistrate derives all his authority from the people
and they have conferred none upon him to fix terms for the separation of the states
the people themselves can do this also if they choose but the executive
as such
has nothing to do with it
his duty is to administer the present government
as it came to his hands
and to transmit it
unimpaired by him
to his successors
why should there not be a patient confidence in the ultimate justice of the people
is there any better or equal hope in the world
in our present differences is either party without faith of being in the right
if the almighty ruler of nations
with his eternal truth and justice
be on your side of the north
or on yours of the south
that truth and that justice will surely prevail by the judgment of this great tribunal of the american people
by the frame of the government under which we live
this same people have wisely given their public servants but little power for mischief and have
with equal wisdom
provided for the return of that little to their own hands at very short intervals
while the people retain their virtue and vigilance
no administration
by any extreme of wickedness or folly
can very seriously injure the government in the short space of four years
my countrymen
one and all
think calmly and well upon this whole subject
nothing valuable can be lost by taking time
if there be an object to hurry any of you in hot haste to a step which you would never take deliberately
that object will be frustrated by taking time but no good object can be frustrated by it
such of you as are now dissatisfied still have the old constitution unimpaired
on the sensitive point
the laws of your own framing under it while the new administration will have no immediate power
if it would
to change either
if it were admitted that you who are dissatisfied hold the right side in the dispute
there still is no single good reason for precipitate action
and a firm reliance on him who has never yet forsaken this favored land
are still competent to adjust in the best way all our present difficulty
in your hands
my dissatisfied fellow countrymen
and not in mine
is the momentous issue of civil war
the government will not assail you
you can have no conflict without being yourselves the aggressors
you have no oath registered in heaven to destroy the government
while i shall have the most solemn one to preserve
and defend it
i am loath to close
we are not enemies
but friends
we must not be enemies
though passion may have strained
it must not break
our bonds of affection
the mystic chords of memory
stretching from every battle field and patriot grave to every living heart and hearthstone all over this broad land
will yet swell the chorus of the union when again touched
as surely they will be
by the better angels of our nature

my dear sir
your note of the 2d instant

was duly received
it is the subject of the most painful solicitude with me

reply to the pennsylvania delegation
march 5
1861 mr
chairman and gentlemen of the pennsylvanian delegation
as i have so frequently said heretofore
when i have had occasion to address the people of the keystone
in my visits to that state
i can now but repeat the assurance of my gratification at the support you gave me at the election
and at the promise of a continuation of that support which is now tendered to me
allusion has been made to the hope that you entertain that you have a president and a government
in respect to that i wish to say to you that in the position i have assumed i wish to do more than i have ever given reason to believe i would do
i do not wish you to believe that i assume to be any better than others who have gone before me
i prefer rather to have it understood that if we ever have a government on the principles we profess
we should remember
while we exercise our opinion
that others have also rights to the exercise of their opinions
and that we should endeavor to allow these rights
and act in such a manner as to create no bad feeling
i hope we have a government and a president
i hope
and wish it to be understood
that there may be no allusion to unpleasant differences
we must remember that the people of all the states are entitled to all the privileges and immunities of the citizens of the several states
we should bear this in mind
and act in such a way as to say nothing insulting or irritating
i would inculcate this idea
so that we may not
like pharisees
set ourselves up to be better than other people
my friends
my public duties are pressing to day
and will prevent my giving more time to you
i should not have left them now
but i could not well deny myself to so large and respectable a body
reply to the massachusetts delegation
march 5
1861 i am thankful for this renewed assurance of kind feeling and confidence
and the support of the old bay state
in so far as you
have expressed
in behalf of those whom you represent
your sanction of what i have enunciated in my inaugural address
this is very grateful to my feelings
the object was one of great delicacy
in presenting views at the opening of an administration under the peculiar circumstances attending my entrance upon the official duties connected with the government
i studied all the points with great anxiety
and presented them with whatever of ability and sense of justice i could bring to bear
if it met the approbation of our good friends in massachusetts
i shall be exceedingly gratified
while i hope it will meet the approbation of friends everywhere
i am thankful for the expressions of those who have voted with us and like every other man of you
i like them as certainly as i do others
as the president in the administration of the government
i hope to be man enough not to know one citizen of the united states from another
nor one section from another
i shall be gratified to have good friends of massachusetts and others who have thus far supported me in these national views still to support me in carrying them out

march 15
1861 the honorable secretary of war
my dear sir
assuming it to be possible to now provision fort sumter
under all the circumstances is it wise to attempt it
please give me your opinion in writing on this question
your obedient servant
same to other members of the cabinet
on royal arbitration of american boundary line to the senate of the united states the senate has transmitted to me a copy of the message sent by my predecessor to that body on the 21st of february last
proposing to take its advice on the subject of a proposition made by the british government through its minister here to refer the matter in controversy between that government and the government of the united states to the arbitrament of the king of sweden and norway
the king of the netherlands
or the republic of the swiss confederation
in that message my predecessor stated that he wished to present to the senate the precise questions following
will the senate approve a treaty referring to either of the sovereign powers above named the dispute now existing between the governments of the united states and great britain concerning the boundary line between vancouver's island and the american continent
in case the referee shall find himself unable to decide where the line is by the description of it in the treaty of june 15
shall he be authorized to establish a line according to the treaty as nearly as possible
which of the three powers named by great britain as an arbiter shall be chosen by the united states
i find no reason to disapprove of the course of my predecessor in this important matter but
on the contrary
i not only shall receive the advice of the senate thereon cheerfully
but i respectfully ask the senate for their advice on the three questions before recited

secretary of state
my dear sir
i believe it is a necessity with us to make the appointments i mentioned last night that is
charles f
adams to england
william l
dayton to france
george p
marsh to sardinia
and anson burlingame to austria
these gentlemen all have my highest esteem
but no one of them is originally suggested by me except mr
adams i take because you suggested him
coupled with his eminent fitness for the place
marsh and mr
burlingame i take because of the intense pressure of their respective states
and their fitness also
the objection to this card is that locally they are so huddled up three being in new england and two from a single state
i have considered this
and will not shrink from the responsibility
being done
leaves but five full missions undisposed of rome
and chili
and then what about carl schurz or
in other words
what about our german friends
shall we put the card through
and arrange the rest afterward

requesting me
if in my opinion not incompatible with the public interest
to communicate to the senate the despatches of major robert anderson to the war department during the time he has been in command of fort sumter
on examination of the correspondence thus called for
i have
with the highest respect for the senate
come to the conclusion that at the present moment the publication of it would be inexpedient

i see by the papers
a vote is to be taken as to the post office

washington city
april 1
1861 sir
circumstances render it necessary to place in command of your ship and for a special purpose an officer who is fully informed and instructed in relation to the wishes of the government
and you will therefore consider yourself detached
but in taking this step the government does not in the least reflect upon your efficiency or patriotism on the contrary
have the fullest confidence in your ability to perform any duty required of you
hoping soon to be able to give you a better command than the one you now enjoy
and trusting that you will have full confidence in the disposition of the government toward you

secretary seward's bid for power memorandum from secretary seward
april 1
1861 some thoughts for the president's consideration
we are at the end of a month's administration
and yet without a policy either domestic or foreign
is not culpable
and it has even been unavoidable
the presence of the senate
with the need to meet applications for patronage
have prevented attention to other and more grave matters
but further delay to adopt and prosecute our policies for both domestic and foreign affairs would not only bring scandal on the administration
but danger upon the country
to do this we must dismiss the applicants for office
but how
i suggest that we make the local appointments forthwith
leaving foreign or general ones for ulterior and occasional action
the policy at home
i am aware that my views are singular
and perhaps not sufficiently explained
my system is built upon this idea as a ruling one
that we must change the question before the public from one upon slavery
or about slavery
for a question upon union or disunion
in other words
from what would be regarded as a party question
to one of patriotism or union
the occupation or evacuation of fort sumter
although not in fact a slavery or a party question
is so regarded
witness the temper manifested by the republicans in the free states
and even by the union men in the south
i would therefore terminate it as a safe means for changing the issue
i deem it fortunate that the last administration created the necessity
for the rest
i would simultaneously defend and reinforce all the ports in the gulf
and have the navy recalled from foreign stations to be prepared for a blockade
put the island of key west under martial law
this will raise distinctly the question of union or disunion
i would maintain every fort and possession in the south
for foreign nations
i would demand explanations from spain and france
at once
i would seek explanations from great britain and russia
and send agents into canada
and central america to rouse a vigorous continental spirit of independence on this continent against european intervention
if satisfactory explanations are not received from spain and france
would convene congress and declare war against them
but whatever policy we adopt
there must be an energetic prosecution of it
for this purpose it must be somebody's business to pursue and direct it incessantly
either the president must do it himself
and be all the while active in it
or devolve it on some member of his cabinet
once adopted
debates on it must end
and all agree and abide
it is not in my especial province but i neither seek to evade nor assume responsibility
reply to secretary seward's memorandum executive mansion
april 1
1861 hon
my dear sir
since parting with you i have been considering your paper dated this day
and entitled some thoughts for the president's consideration
the first proposition in it is
we are at the end of a month's administration
and yet without a policy either domestic or foreign
at the beginning of that month
in the inaugural
i said
the power confided to me will be used to hold
and possess the property and places belonging to the government
and to collect the duties and imposts
this had your distinct approval at the time and
taken in connection with the order i immediately gave general scott
directing him to employ every means in his power to strengthen and hold the forts
comprises the exact domestic policy you now urge
with the single exception that it does not propose to abandon fort sumter
i do not perceive how the reinforcement of fort sumter would be done on a slavery or a party issue
while that of fort pickens would be on a more national and patriotic one
the news received yesterday in regard to st
domingo certainly brings a new item within the range of our foreign policy but up to that time we have been preparing circulars and instructions to ministers and the like
all in perfect harmony
without even a suggestion that we had no foreign policy
upon your closing propositions that
whatever policy we adopt
there must be an energetic prosecution of it
for this purpose it must be somebody's business to pursue and direct it incessantly
either the president must do it himself
and be all the while active in it
devolve it on some member of his cabinet
once adopted
debates on it must end
and all agree and abide i remark that if this must be done
i must do it
when a general line of policy is adopted
i apprehend there is no danger of its being changed without good reason
or continuing to be a subject of unnecessary debate still
upon points arising in its progress i wish
and suppose i am entitled to have
the advice of all the cabinet
your obedient servant
reply to a committee from the virginia convention
april 13
1861 hon
william ballard preston
alexander h
george w
as a committee of the virginia convention now in session
you present me a preamble and resolution in these words
in the opinion of this convention
the uncertainty which prevails in the public mind as to the policy which the federal executive intends to pursue toward the seceded states is extremely injurious to the industrial and commercial interests of the country
tends to keep up an excitement which is unfavorable to the adjustment of pending difficulties
and threatens a disturbance of the public peace
therefore resolved
that a committee of three delegates be appointed by this convention to wait upon the president of the united states
present to him this preamble and resolution
and respectfully ask him to communicate to this convention the policy which the federal executive intends to pursue in regard to the confederate states
adopted by the convention of the state of virginia
april 8
in answer i have to say that
having at the beginning of my official term expressed my intended policy as plainly as i was able
it is with deep regret and some mortification i now learn that there is great and injurious uncertainty in the public mind as to what that policy is
and what course i intend to pursue
not having as yet seen occasion to change
it is now my purpose to pursue the course marked out in the inaugural address
i commend a careful consideration of the whole document as the best expression i can give of my purposes
as i then and therein said
i now repeat
the power confided to me will be used to hold
and possess the property and places belonging to the government
and to collect the duties and imposts but beyond what is necessary for these objects
there will be no invasion
no using of force against or among the people anywhere
by the words property and places belonging to the government
i chiefly allude to the military posts and property which were in the possession of the government when it came to my hands
but if
as now appears to be true
in pursuit of a purpose to drive the united states authority from these places
an unprovoked assault has been made upon fort sumter
i shall hold myself at liberty to repossess
if i can
like places which had been seized before the government was devolved upon me
and in every event i shall
to the extent of my ability
repel force by force
in case it proves true that fort sumter has been assaulted
as is reported
i shall perhaps cause the united states mails to be withdrawn from all the states which claim to have seceded
believing that the commencement of actual war against the government justifies and possibly demands this
i scarcely need to say that i consider the military posts and property situated within the states which claim to have seceded as yet belonging to the government of the united states as much as they did before the supposed secession
whatever else i may do for the purpose
i shall not attempt to collect the duties and imposts by any armed invasion of any part of the country not meaning by this
that i may not land a force deemed necessary to relieve a fort upon a border of the country
from the fact that i have quoted a part of the inaugural address
it must not be inferred that i repudiate any other part
the whole of which i reaffirm
except so far as what i now say of the mails may be regarded as a modification
proclamation calling for 75
000 militia
and convening congress in extra session
april 15
by the president of the united states of america
a proclamation
whereas the laws of the united states have been for some time past and now are opposed
and the execution thereof obstructed
in the states of south carolina
and texas
by combinations too powerful to be suppressed by the ordinary course of judicial proceedings
or by the powers vested in the marshals bylaw
president of the united states
in virtue of the power in me vested by the constitution and the laws
have thought fit to call forth
and hereby do call forth
the militia of the several states of the union
to the aggregate number of seventy five thousand
in order to suppress said combinations
and to cause the laws to be duly executed
the details for this object will be immediately communicated to the state authorities through the war department
i appeal to all loyal citizens to favor
and aid this effort to maintain the honor
the integrity
and the existence of our national union
and the perpetuity of popular government and to redress wrongs already long enough endured
i deem it proper to say that the first service assigned to the forces hereby called forth will probably be to repossess the forts
and property which have been seized from the union and in every event the utmost care will be observed
consistently with the objects aforesaid
to avoid any devastation
any destruction of or interference with property
or any disturbance of peaceful citizens in any part of the country
and i hereby command the persons composing the combinations aforesaid to disperse and retire peacefully to their respective abodes within twenty days from date
deeming that the present condition of public affairs presents an extraordinary occasion
i do hereby
in virtue of the power in me vested by the constitution
convene both houses of congress
senators and representatives are therefore summoned to assemble at their respective chambers
at twelve o'clock noon
on thursday
the fourth day of july next
then and there to consider and determine such measures as
in their wisdom
the public safety and interest may seem to demand

april 19
1861 by the president of the united states of america
a proclamation
whereas an insurrection against the government of the united states has broken out in the states of south carolina
and texas
and the laws of the united states for the collection of the revenue cannot be effectually executed therein conformably to that provision of the constitution which requires duties to be uniform throughout the united states
and whereas a combination of persons engaged in such insurrection have threatened to grant pretended letters of marque to authorize the bearers thereof to commit assaults on the lives
and property of good citizens of the country lawfully engaged in commerce on the high seas
and in waters of the united states
and whereas an executive proclamation has been already issued requiring the persons engaged in these disorderly proceedings to desist therefrom
calling out a militia force for the purpose of repressing the same
and convening congress in extraordinary session to deliberate and determine thereon
abraham lincoln
president of the united states
with a view to the same purposes before mentioned
and to the protection of the public peace
and the lives and property of quiet and orderly citizens pursuing their lawful occupations
until congress shall have assembled and deliberated on the said unlawful proceedings
or until the same shall have ceased
have further deemed it advisable to set on foot a blockade of the ports within the states aforesaid
in pursuance of the laws of the united states
and of the law of nations in such case provided
for this purpose a competent force will be posted so as to prevent entrance and exit of vessels from the ports aforesaid
with a view to violate such blockade
a vessel shall approach or shall attempt to leave either of the said ports
she will be duly warned by the commander of one of the blockading vessels
who will indorse on her register the fact and date of such warning
and if the same vessel shall again attempt to enter or leave the blockaded port
she will be captured and sent to the nearest convenient port
for such proceedings against her and her cargo
as prize
as may be deemed advisable
and i hereby proclaim and declare that if any person
under the pretended authority of the said states
or under any other pretense
shall molest a vessel of the united states
or the persons or cargo on board of her
such person will be held amenable to the laws of the united states for the prevention and punishment of piracy
in witness whereof
i have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the united states to be affixed

your letter by messrs

i tender you both my sincere thanks for your efforts to keep the peace in the trying situation in which you are placed
for the future troops must be brought here
but i make no point of bringing them through baltimore
without any military knowledge myself
of course i must leave details to general scott
he hastily said this morning in the presence of these gentlemen
march them around baltimore
and not through it
i sincerely hope the general
on fuller reflection
will consider this practical and proper
and that you will not object to it
by this a collision of the people of baltimore with the troops will be avoided
unless they go out of their way to seek it
i hope you will exert your influence to prevent this
now and ever i shall do all in my power for peace consistently with the maintenance of the government

order to defend from a maryland insurrection order to general scott
april 25
1861 lieutenant general scott
my dear sir the maryland legislature assembles to morrow at annapolis
and not improbably will take action to arm the people of that state against the united states
the question has been submitted to and considered by me whether it would not be justifiable
upon the ground of necessary defense
for you
as general in chief of the united states army
to arrest or disperse the members of that body
i think it would not be justifiable nor efficient for the desired object
they have a clearly legal right to assemble
and we cannot know in advance that their action will not be lawful and peaceful
and if we wait until they shall have acted their arrest or dispersion will not lessen the effect of their action
we cannot permanently prevent their action
if we arrest them
we cannot long hold them as prisoners
and when liberated they will immediately reassemble and take their action and precisely the same if we simply disperse them they will immediately reassemble in some other place
i therefore conclude that it is only left to the commanding general to watch and await their action
if it shall be to arm their people against the united states
he is to adopt the most prompt and efficient means to counteract
if necessary
to the bombardment of their cities and
in the extremist necessity
the suspension of the writ of habeas corpus

proclamation of blockade
april 27
1861 by the president of the united states of america
a proclamation
for the reasons assigned in my proclamation of the nineteenth instant
a blockade of the ports of the states of south carolina
and texas was ordered to be established
and whereas
since that date
public property of the united states has been seized
the collection of the revenue obstructed
and duly commissioned officers of the united states
while engaged in executing the orders of their superiors
have been arrested and held in custody as prisoners
or have been impeded in the discharge of their official duties
without due legal process
by persons claiming to act under authorities of the states of virginia and north carolina
an efficient blockade of the ports of those states will also be established
in witness whereof i have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the united states to be affixed

april 27
1861 i have desired as sincerely as any man
and i sometimes think more than any other man
that our present difficulties might be settled without the shedding of blood
i will not say that all hope has yet gone but if the alternative is presented whether the union is to be broken in fragments and the liberties of the people lost
or blood be shed
you will probably make the choice with which i shall not be dissatisfied
localized repeal of writ of habeas corpus to general scott
to the commanding general
army of the united states
you are engaged in suppressing an insurrection against the laws of the united states
if at any point on or in the vicinity of any military line which is now or which shall be used between the city of philadelphia and the city of washington you find resistance which renders it necessary to suspend the writ of habeas corpus for the public safety
you personally
or through the officer in command at the point at which resistance occurs
are authorized to suspend that writ

1861 captain g
my dear sir
i sincerely regret that the failure of the late attempt to provision fort sumter should be the source of any annoyance to you
the practicability of your plan was not
in fact
brought to a test
by reason of a gale
well known in advance to be possible and not improbable
the tugs
an essential part of the plan
never reached the ground while
by an accident for which you were in no wise responsible
and possibly i to some extent was
you were deprived of a war vessel
with her men
which you deemed of great importance to the enterprise
i most cheerfully and truly declare that the failure of the undertaking has not lowered you a particle
while the qualities you developed in the effort have greatly heightened you in my estimation
for a daring and dangerous enterprise of a similar character you would to day be the man of all my acquaintances whom i would select
you and i both anticipated that the cause of the country would be advanced by making the attempt to provision fort sumter
even if it should fail and it is no small consolation now to feel that our anticipation is justified by the result

president lincoln's corrections of a diplomatic despatch written by the secretary of state to minister adams no
department of state
may 21
1861 sir
in a brief despatch of may 2d no
tells us that lord john russell recently requested an interview with him on account of the solicitude which his lordship felt concerning the effect of certain measures represented as likely to be adopted by the president
in that conversation the british secretary told mr
dallas that the three representatives of the southern confederacy were then in london
that lord john russell had not yet seen them
but that he was not unwilling to see them unofficially
he further informed mr
dallas that an understanding exists between the british and french governments which would lead both to take one and the same course as to recognition
his lordship then referred to the rumor of a meditated blockade by us of southern ports
and a discontinuance of them as ports of entry
dallas answered that he knew nothing on those topics
and therefore the president's corrections
both in notes and text
are in caps
all matter between brackets was to be marked out
could say nothing
he added that you were expected to arrive in two weeks
upon this statement lord john russell acquiesced in the expediency of waiting for the full knowledge you were expected to bring
dallas transmitted to us some newspaper reports of ministerial explanations made in parliament
you will base no proceedings on parliamentary debates further than to seek explanations when necessary and communicate them to this department
we intend to have a clear and simple record of whatever issue may arise between us and great britain
the president is surprised and grieved regrets that mr
dallas did not protest against the proposed unofficial intercourse between the british government and the missionaries of the insurgents as well as against the demand for explanations made by the british government
it is due
to mr
dallas to say that our instructions had been given only to you and not to him
and that his loyalty and fidelity
too rare in these times among our late representatives abroad
are confessed and are appreciated
intercourse of any kind with the so called commissioners is liable to be construed as a recognition of the authority which appointed them
such intercourse would be none the less wrongful hurtful to us for being called unofficial
and it might be even more injurious
because we should have no means of knowing what points might be resolved by it
unofficial intercourse is useless and meaningless if it is not expected to ripen into official intercourse and direct recognition
it is left doubtful here whether the proposed unofficial intercourse has yet actually begun
your own present antecedent instructions are deemed explicit enough
and it is hoped that you have not misunderstood them
you will in any event desist from all intercourse whatever
unofficial as well as official
with the british government
so long as it shall continue intercourse of either kind with the domestic enemies of this country confining yourself to a delivery of a copy of this paper to the secretary of state
after doing this
when intercourse shall have been arrested for this cause
you will communicate with this department and receive further directions
lord john russell has informed us of an understanding between the british and french governments that they will act together in regard to our affairs
this communication
loses something of its value from the circumstance that the communication was withheld until after knowledge of the fact had been acquired by us from other sources
we know also another fact that has not yet been officially communicated to us namely
that other european states are apprised by france and england of their agreement
and are expected to concur with or follow them in whatever measures they adopt on the subject of recognition
the united states have been impartial and just in all their conduct toward the several nations of europe
they will not complain
of the combination now announced by the two leading powers
although they think they had a right to expect a more independent
if not a more friendly
course from each of them
you will take no notice of that or any other alliance
whenever the european governments shall see fit to communicate directly with us
we shall be
as heretofore
frank and explicit in our reply
as to the blockade
you will say that by the our own laws of nature and the laws of nature and the laws of nations
this government has a clear right to suppress insurrection
an exclusion of commerce from national ports which have been seized by the insurgents
in the equitable form of blockade
is the proper means to that end
you will admit not insist that our blockade is not to be respected if it be not maintained by a competent force but passing by that question as not now a practical
or at least an urgent
you will add that it the blockade is now
and it will continue to be so maintained
and therefore we expect it to be respected by great britain
you will add that we have already revoked the exequatur of a russian consul who had enlisted in the military service of the insurgents
and we shall dismiss or demand the recall of every foreign agent
consular or diplomatic
who shall either disobey the federal laws or disown the federal authority
as to the recognition of the so called southern confederacy
it is not to be made a subject of technical definition
it is
of course
quasi direct recognition to publish an acknowledgment of the sovereignty and independence of a new power
it is quasi direct recognition to receive its ambassadors
or commissioners officially
a concession of belligerent rights is liable to be construed as a recognition of them
no one of these proceedings will be borne pass unnoticed unquestioned by the united states in this case
hitherto recognition has been moved only on the assumption that the so called confederate states are de facto a self sustaining power
after long forbearance
designed to soothe discontent and avert the need of civil war
the land and naval forces of the united states have been put in motion to repress the insurrection
the true character of the pretended new state is at once revealed
it is seen to be a power existing in pronunciamento only
it has never won a field
it has obtained no forts that were not virtually betrayed into its hands or seized in breach of trust
it commands not a single port on the coast nor any highway out from its pretended capital by land
under these circumstances great britain is called upon to intervene and give it body and independence by resisting our measures of suppression
british recognition would be british intervention to create within our own territory a hostile state by overthrowing this republic itself
when this act of intervention is distinctly performed
we from that hour shall cease to be friends
and become once more
as we have twice before been forced to be
enemies of great britain
as to the treatment of privateers in the insurgent service
you will say that this is a question exclusively our own
we treat them as pirates
they are our own citizens
or persons employed by our citizens
preying on the commerce of our country
if great britain shall choose to recognize them as lawful belligerents
and give them shelter from our pursuit and punishment
the laws of nations afford an adequate and proper remedy and we shall avail ourselves of it
and while you need not say this in advance
be sure that you say nothing inconsistent with it
happily
her britannic majesty's government can avoid all these difficulties
it invited us in 1856 to accede to the declaration of the congress of paris
of which body great britain was herself a member
abolishing privateering everywhere in all cases and forever
you already have our authority to propose to her our accession to that declaration
if she refuse to receive it
it can only be because she is willing to become the patron of privateering when aimed at our devastation
these positions are not elaborately defended now
because to vindicate them would imply a possibility of our waiving them
1 we are not insensible of the grave importance of 1 drop all from this line to the end
and in lieu of it write
this paper is for your own guidance only
and not sic to be read or shown to any one
secretary seward
when the despatch was returned to him
added an introductory paragraph stating that the document was strictly confidential
for this reason these last two paragraphs remained as they are here printed
this occasion
we see how
upon the result of the debate in which we are engaged
a war may ensue between the united states and one
or even more european nations
war in any case is as exceptionable from the habits as it is revolting from the sentiments of the american people
but if it come
it will be fully seen that it results from the action of great britain
not our own that great britain will have decided to fraternize with our domestic enemy
either without waiting to hear from you our remonstrances and our warnings
or after having heard them
war in defense of national life is not immoral
and war in defense of independence is an inevitable part of the discipline of nations
the dispute will be between the european and the american branches of the british race
all who belong to that race will especially deprecate it
as they ought
it may well be believed that men of every race and kindred will deplore it
a war not unlike it between the same parties occurred at the close of the last century
europe atoned by forty years of suffering for the error that great britain committed in provoking that contest
if that nation shall now repeat the same great error
the social convulsions which will follow may not be so long
but they will be more general
when they shall have ceased
it will
we think
be seen
whatever may have been the fortunes of other nations
that it is not the united states that will have come out of them with its precious constitution altered or its honestly obtained dominion in any degree abridged
great britain has but to wait a few months and all her present inconveniences will cease with all our own troubles
if she take a different course
she will calculate for herself the ultimate as well as the immediate consequences
and will consider what position she will hold when she shall have forever lost the sympathies and the affections of the only nation on whose sympathies and affections she has a natural claim
in making that calculation she will do well to remember that in the controversy she proposes to open we shall be actuated by neither pride
nor passion
nor cupidity
nor ambition but we shall stand simply on the principle of self preservation
and that our cause will involve the independence of nations and the rights of human nature

elmer e
my dear sir and madame
in the untimely loss of your noble son
our affliction here is scarcely less than your own
so much of promised usefulness to one's country
and of bright hopes for one's self and friends
have never been so suddenly dashed as in his fall
in size
in years
and in youthful appearance a boy only
his power to command men was surpassingly great
this power
combined with a fine intellectual and indomitable energy
and a taste altogether military
constituted in him
as seemed to me
the best natural talent in that department i ever knew
and yet he was singularly modest and deferential in social intercourse
my acquaintance with him began less than two years ago yet
through the latter half of the intervening period
it was as intense as the disparity of our ages and my engrossing engagements would permit
to me he appeared to have no indulgences or pastimes
and i never heard him utter a profane or an intemperate word
what was conclusive of his good heart
he never forgot his parents
the honors he labored for so laudably
and for which
in the sad end
he so gallantly gave his life
he meant for them no less than for himself
in the hope that it may be no intrusion upon the sacredness of your sorrow
i have ventured to address you this tribute to the memory of my young friend and your brave and early fallen son
may god give you the consolation which is beyond all early power
sincerely your friend in common affliction

edwards my dear sir
when you wrote me some time ago in reference to looking up something in the departments here
i thought i would inquire into the thing and write you
but the extraordinary pressure upon me diverted me from it
and soon it passed out of my mind
the thing you proposed
it seemed to me
i ought to understand myself before it was set on foot by my direction or permission and i really had no time to make myself acquainted with it
nor have i yet
and yet i am unwilling
of course
that you should be deprived of a chance to make something
if it can be done without injustice to the government
or to any individual
if you choose to come here and point out to me how this can be done i shall not only not object
but shall be gratified to be able to oblige you

since you spoke to me yesterday about general j
of kansas
i have been reflecting upon the subject
and have concluded that we need the service of such a man out there at once that we had better appoint him a brigadier general of volunteers to day
and send him off with such authority to raise a force i think two regiments better than three
but as to this i am not particular as you think will get him into actual work quickest
tell him
when he starts
to put it through not to be writing or telegraphing back here

army of the united states
you are engaged in suppressing an insurrection against the laws of the united states

message to congress in special session
july 4
fellow citizens of the senate and house of representatives
having been convened on an extraordinary occasion
as authorized by the constitution
your attention is not called to any ordinary subject of legislation
at the beginning of the present presidential term
four months ago
the functions of the federal government were found to be generally suspended within the several states of south carolina
and florida
excepting only those of the post office department
within these states all the forts
and the like
including the movable and stationary property in and about them
had been seized
and were held in open hostility to this government
excepting only forts pickens
and jefferson
on and near the florida coast
and fort sumter
in charleston harbor
south carolina
the forts thus seized had been put in improved condition
new ones had been built
and armed forces had been organized and were organizing
all avowedly with the same hostile purpose
the forts remaining in the possession of the federal government in and near these states were either besieged or menaced by warlike preparations
and especially fort sumter was nearly surrounded by well protected hostile batteries
with guns equal in quality to the best of its own
and outnumbering the latter as perhaps ten to one
a disproportionate share of the federal muskets and rifles had somehow found their way into these states
and had been seized to be used against the government
accumulations of the public revenue lying within them had been seized for the same object
the navy was scattered in distant seas
leaving but a very small part of it within the immediate reach of the government
officers of the federal army and navy had resigned in great numbers and of those resigning a large proportion had taken up arms against the government
and in connection with all this
the purpose to sever the federal union was openly avowed
in accordance with this purpose
an ordinance had been adopted in each of these states
declaring the states respectively to be separated from the national union
a formula for instituting a combined government of these states had been promulgated and this illegal organization
in the character of confederate states
was already invoking recognition
and intervention from foreign powers
finding this condition of things
and believing it to be an imperative duty upon the incoming executive to prevent
if possible
the consummation of such attempt to destroy the federal union
a choice of means to that end became indispensable
this choice was made and was declared in the inaugural address
the policy chosen looked to the exhaustion of all peaceful measures before a resort to any stronger ones
it sought only to hold the public places and property not already wrested from the government
and to collect the revenue
relying for the rest on time
and the ballot box
it promised a continuance of the mails
at government expense
to the very people who were resisting the government and it gave repeated pledges against any disturbance to any of the people
or any of their rights
of all that which a president might constitutionally and justifiably do in such a case
everything was forborne without which it was believed possible to keep the government on foot
on the 5th of march the present incumbent's first full day in office
a letter of major anderson
commanding at fort sumter
written on the 28th of february and received at the war department on the 4th of march
was by that department placed in his hands
this letter expressed the professional opinion of the writer that reinforcements could not be thrown into that fort within the time for his relief
rendered necessary by the limited supply of provisions
and with a view of holding possession of the same
with a force of less than twenty thousand good and well disciplined men
this opinion was concurred in by all the officers of his command
and their memoranda on the subject were made inclosures of major anderson's letter
the whole was immediately laid before lieutenant general scott
who at once concurred with major anderson in opinion
on reflection
he took full time
consulting with other officers
both of the army and the navy
and at the end of four days came reluctantly but decidedly to the same conclusion as before
he also stated at the same time that no such sufficient force was then at the control of the government
or could be raised and brought to the ground within the time when the provisions in the fort would be exhausted
in a purely military point of view
this reduced the duty of the administration in the case to the mere matter of getting the garrison safely out of the fort
it was believed
that to so abandon that position
under the circumstances
would be utterly ruinous that the necessity under which it was to be done would not be fully understood that by many it would be construed as a part of a voluntary policy that at home it would discourage the friends of the union
embolden its adversaries
and go far to insure to the latter a recognition abroad that in fact
it would be our national destruction consummated
this could not be allowed
starvation was not yet upon the garrison
and ere it would be reached fort pickens might be reinforced
this last would be a clear indication of policy
and would better enable the country to accept the evacuation of fort sumter as a military necessity
an order was at once directed to be sent for the landing of the troops from the steamship brooklyn into fort pickens
this order could not go by land
but must take the longer and slower route by sea
the first return news from the order was received just one week before the fall of fort sumter
the news itself was that the officer commanding the sabine
to which vessel the troops had been transferred from the brooklyn
acting upon some quasi armistice of the late administration and of the existence of which the present administration
up to the time the order was despatched
had only too vague and uncertain rumors to fix attention
had refused to land the troops
to now reinforce fort pickens before a crisis would be reached at fort sumter was impossible rendered so by the near exhaustion of provisions in the latter named fort
in precaution against such a conjuncture
the government had
a few days before
commenced preparing an expedition as well adapted as might be to relieve fort sumter
which expedition was intended to be ultimately used
or not
according to circumstances
the strongest anticipated case for using it was now presented
and it was resolved to send it forward
as had been intended in this contingency
it was also resolved to notify the governor of south carolina that he might expect an attempt would be made to provision the fort and that
if the attempt should not be resisted
there would be no effort to throw in men
or ammunition
without further notice
or in case of an attack upon the fort
this notice was accordingly given whereupon the fort was attacked and bombarded to its fall
without even awaiting the arrival of the provisioning expedition
it is thus seen that the assault upon and reduction of fort sumter was in no sense a matter of self defense on the part of the assailants
they well knew that the garrison in the fort could by no possibility commit aggression upon them
they knew they were expressly notified that the giving of bread to the few brave and hungry men of the garrison was all which would on that occasion be attempted
unless themselves
by resisting so much
should provoke more
they knew that this government desired to keep the garrison in the fort
not to assail them
but merely to maintain visible possession
and thus to preserve the union from actual and immediate dissolution trusting
as hereinbefore stated
to time
and the ballot box for final adjustment and they assailed and reduced the fort for precisely the reverse object to drive out the visible authority of the federal union
and thus force it to immediate dissolution
that this was their object the executive well understood and having said to them in the inaugural address
you can have no conflict without being yourselves the aggressors
he took pains not only to keep this declaration good
but also to keep the case so free from the power of ingenious sophistry that the world should not be able to misunderstand it
by the affair at fort sumter
with its surrounding circumstances
that point was reached
then and thereby the assailants of the government began the conflict of arms
without a gun in sight or in expectancy to return their fire
save only the few in the fort sent to that harbor years before for their own protection
and still ready to give that protection in whatever was lawful
in this act
discarding all else
they have forced upon the country the distinct issue
immediate dissolution or blood
and this issue embraces more than the fate of these united states
it presents to the whole family of man the question whether a constitutional republic or democracy a government of the people by the same people can or cannot maintain its territorial integrity against its own domestic foes
it presents the question whether discontented individuals
too few in numbers to control administration according to organic law in any case
can always
upon the pretenses made in this case
or on any other pretenses
or arbitrarily without any pretense
break up their government
and thus practically put an end to free government upon the earth
it forces us to ask
is there in all republics this inherent and fatal weakness
must a government
of necessity
be too strong for the liberties of its own people
or too weak to maintain its own existence
so viewing the issue
no choice was left but to call out the war power of the government
and so to resist force employed for its destruction by force for its preservation
the call was made
and the response of the country was most gratifying
surpassing in unanimity and spirit the most sanguine expectation
yet none of the states commonly called slave states
except delaware
gave a regiment through regular state organization
a few regiments have been organized within some others of those states by individual enterprise
and received into the government service
of course the seceded states
so called and to which texas had been joined about the time of the inauguration
gave no troops to the cause of the union
the border states
so called
were not uniform in their action
some of them being almost for the union
while in others as virginia
north carolina
and arkansas the union sentiment was nearly repressed and silenced
the course taken in virginia was the most remarkable perhaps the most important
a convention elected by the people of that state to consider this very question of disrupting the federal union was in session at the capital of virginia when fort sumter fell
to this body the people had chosen a large majority of professed union men
almost immediately after the fall of sumter
many members of that majority went over to the original disunion minority
and with them adopted an ordinance for withdrawing the state from the union
whether this change was wrought by their great approval of the assault upon sumter
or their great resentment at the government's resistance to that assault
is not definitely known
although they submitted the ordinance for ratification to a vote of the people
to be taken on a day then somewhat more than a month distant
the convention and the legislature which was also in session at the same time and place
with leading men of the state not members of either
immediately commenced acting as if the state were already out of the union
they pushed military preparations vigorously forward all over the state
they seized the united states armory at harper's ferry
and the navy yard at gosport
near norfolk
they received perhaps invited into their state large bodies of troops
with their warlike appointments
from the so called seceded states
they formally entered into a treaty of temporary alliance and co operation with the so called confederate states
and sent members to their congress at montgomery
and finally
they permitted the insurrectionary government to be transferred to their capital at richmond
the people of virginia have thus allowed this giant insurrection to make its nest within her borders and this government has no choice left but to deal with it where it finds it
and it has the less regret as the loyal citizens have
in due form
claimed its protection
those loyal citizens this government is bound to recognize and protect
as being virginia
in the border states
so called
in fact
the middle states
there are those who favor a policy which they call armed neutrality that is
an arming of those states to prevent the union forces passing one way
or the disunion the other
over their soil
this would be disunion completed
figuratively speaking
it would be the building of an impassable wall along the line of separation and yet not quite an impassable one
for under the guise of neutrality it would tie the hands of union men and freely pass supplies from among them to the insurrectionists
which it could not do as an open enemy
at a stroke it would take all the trouble off the hands of secession
except only what proceeds from the external blockade
it would do for the disunionists that which
of all things
they most desire feed them well and give them disunion without a struggle of their own
it recognizes no fidelity to the constitution
no obligation to maintain the union and while very many who have favored it are doubtless loyal citizens
it is
very injurious in effect
recurring to the action of the government
it may be stated that at first a call was made for 75
000 militia and
rapidly following this
a proclamation was issued for closing the ports of the insurrectionary districts by proceedings in the nature of blockade
so far all was believed to be strictly legal
at this point the insurrectionists announced their purpose to enter upon the practice of privateering
other calls were made for volunteers to serve for three years
unless sooner discharged
and also for large additions to the regular army and navy
these measures
whether strictly legal or not
were ventured upon
under what appeared to be a popular demand and a public necessity trusting then
as now
that congress would readily ratify them
it is believed that nothing has been done beyond the constitutional competency of congress
soon after the first call for militia
it was considered a duty to authorize the commanding general in proper cases
according to his discretion
to suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus
in other words
to arrest and detain
without resort to the ordinary processes and forms of law
such individuals as he might deem dangerous to the public safety
this authority has purposely been exercised but very sparingly
the legality and propriety of what has been done under it are questioned
and the attention of the country has been called to the proposition that one who has sworn to take care that the laws be faithfully executed should not himself violate them
of course some consideration was given to the questions of power and propriety before this matter was acted upon
the whole of the laws which were required to be faithfully executed were being resisted and failing of execution in nearly one third of the states
must they be allowed to finally fail of execution
even had it been perfectly clear that by the use of the means necessary to their execution some single law
made in such extreme tenderness of the citizen's liberty that
it relieves more of the guilty than of the innocent
should to a very limited extent be violated
to state the question more directly
are all the laws but one to go unexecuted
and the government itself go to pieces lest that one be violated
even in such a case
would not the official oath be broken if the government should be overthrown when it was believed that disregarding the single law would tend to preserve it
but it was not believed that this question was presented
it was not believed that any law was violated
the provision of the constitution that the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended
unless when
in cases of rebellion or invasion
the public safety may require it
is equivalent to a provision is a provision that such privilege may be suspended when
in case of rebellion or invasion
the public safety does require it
it was decided that we have a case of rebellion
and that the public safety does require the qualified suspension of the privilege of the writ which was authorized to be made
now it is insisted that congress
and not the executive
is vested with this power
but the constitution itself is silent as to which or who is to exercise the power and as the provision was plainly made for a dangerous emergency
it cannot be believed the framers of the instrument intended that in every case the danger should run its course until congress could be called together
the very assembling of which might be prevented
as was intended in this case
by the rebellion
no more extended argument is now offered
as an opinion at some length will probably be presented by the attorney general
whether there shall be any legislation upon the subject
and if any
is submitted entirely to the better judgment of congress
the forbearance of this government had been so extraordinary and so long continued as to lead some foreign nations to shape their action as if they supposed the early destruction of our national union was probable
while this
on discovery
gave the executive some concern
he is now happy to say that the sovereignty and rights of the united states are now everywhere practically respected by foreign powers and a general sympathy with the country is manifested throughout the world
the reports of the secretaries of the treasury
and the navy will give the information in detail deemed necessary and convenient for your deliberation and action while the executive and all the departments will stand ready to supply omissions
or to communicate new facts considered important for you to know
it is now recommended that you give the legal means for making this contest a short and decisive one
that you place at the control of the government for the work at least four hundred thousand men and 400
that number of men is about one tenth of those of proper ages within the regions where
all are willing to engage and the sum is less than a twenty third part of the money value owned by the men who seem ready to devote the whole
a debt of 600
000 now is a less sum per head than was the debt of our revolution when we came out of that struggle and the money value in the country now bears even a greater proportion to what it was then than does the population
surely each man has as strong a motive now to preserve our liberties as each had then to establish them
a right result at this time will be worth more to the world than ten times the men and ten times the money
the evidence reaching us from the country leaves no doubt that the material for the work is abundant
and that it needs only the hand of legislation to give it legal sanction
and the hand of the executive to give it practical shape and efficiency
one of the greatest perplexities of the government is to avoid receiving troops faster than it can provide for them
in a word
the people will save their government if the government itself will do its part only indifferently well
it might seem
at first thought
to be of little difference whether the present movement at the south be called secession or rebellion
the movers
well understand the difference
at the beginning they knew they could never raise their treason to any respectable magnitude by any name which implies violation of law
they knew their people possessed as much of moral sense
as much of devotion to law and order
and as much pride in and reverence for the history and government of their common country as any other civilized and patriotic people
they knew they could make no advancement directly in the teeth of these strong and noble sentiments
they commenced by an insidious debauching of the public mind
they invented an ingenious sophism which
if conceded
was followed by perfectly logical steps
through all the incidents
to the complete destruction of the union
the sophism itself is that any state of the union may consistently with the national constitution
and therefore lawfully and peacefully
withdraw from the union without the consent of the union or of any other state
the little disguise that the supposed right is to be exercised only for just cause
themselves to be the sole judges of its justice
is too thin to merit any notice
with rebellion thus sugar coated they have been drugging the public mind of their section for more than thirty years
and until at length they have brought many good men to a willingness to take up arms against the government the day after some assemblage of men have enacted the farcical pretense of taking their state out of the union
who could have been brought to no such thing the day before
this sophism derives much
perhaps the whole
of its currency from the assumption that there is some omnipotent and sacred supremacy pertaining to a state to each state of our federal union
our states have neither more nor less power than that reserved to them in the union by the constitution no one of them ever having been a state out of the union
the original ones passed into the union even before they cast off their british colonial dependence and the new ones each came into the union directly from a condition of dependence
excepting texas
and even texas in its temporary independence was never designated a state
the new ones only took the designation of states on coming into the union
while that name was first adopted for the old ones in and by the declaration of independence
therein the united colonies were declared to be free and independent states but even then the object plainly was not to declare their independence of one another or of the union
but directly the contrary
as their mutual pledge and their mutual action before
at the time
and afterward
abundantly show
the express plighting of faith by each and all of the original thirteen in the articles of confederation
two years later
that the union shall be perpetual
is most conclusive
having never been states either in substance or in name outside of the union
whence this magical omnipotence of state rights
asserting a claim of power to lawfully destroy the union itself
much is said about the sovereignty of the states but the word even is not in the national constitution
as is believed
in any of the state constitutions
what is sovereignty in the political sense of the term
would it be far wrong to define it as a political community without a political superior
tested by this
no one of our states except texas ever was a sovereignty
and even texas gave up the character on coming into the union by which act she acknowledged the constitution of the united states
and the laws and treaties of the united states made in pursuance of the constitution
to be for her the supreme law of the land
the states have their status in the union
and they have no other legal status
if they break from this
they can only do so against law and by revolution
the union
and not themselves separately
procured their independence and their liberty
by conquest or purchase the union gave each of them whatever of independence or liberty it has
the union is older than any of the states
in fact
it created them as states
originally some dependent colonies made the union
in turn
the union threw off their old dependence for them
and made them states
such as they are
not one of them ever had a state constitution independent of the union
of course
it is not forgotten that all the new states framed their constitutions before they entered the union nevertheless
dependent upon and preparatory to coming into the union
unquestionably the states have the powers and rights reserved to them in and by the national constitution but among these surely are not included all conceivable powers
however mischievous or destructive
at most
such only as were known in the world at the time as governmental powers and certainly a power to destroy the government itself had never been known as a governmental
as a merely administrative power
this relative matter of national power and state rights
as a principle
is no other than the principle of generality and locality
whatever concerns the whole should be confided to the whole to the general government while whatever concerns only the state should be left exclusively to the state
this is all there is of original principle about it
whether the national constitution in defining boundaries between the two has applied the principle with exact accuracy
is not to be questioned
we are all bound by that defining
without question
what is now combated is the position that secession is consistent with the constitution is lawful and peaceful
it is not contended that there is any express law for it and nothing should ever be implied as law which leads to unjust or absurd consequences
the nation purchased with money the countries out of which several of these states were formed
is it just that they shall go off without leave and without refunding
the nation paid very large sums in the aggregate
i believe
nearly a hundred millions to relieve florida of the aboriginal tribes
is it just that she shall now be off without consent or without making any return
the nation is now in debt for money applied to the benefit of these so called seceding states in common with the rest
is it just either that creditors shall go unpaid or the remaining states pay the whole
a part of the present national debt was contracted to pay the old debts of texas
is it just that she shall leave and pay no part of this herself
if one state may secede
so may another and when all shall have seceded
none is left to pay the debts
is this quite just for creditors
did we notify them of this sage view of ours when we borrowed their money
if we now recognize this doctrine by allowing the seceders to go in peace
it is difficult to see what we can do if others choose to go or to extort terms upon which they will promise to remain
the seceders insist that our constitution admits of secession
they have assumed to make a national constitution of their own
in which of necessity they have either discarded or retained the right of secession as they insist it exists in ours
if they have discarded it
they thereby admit that on principle it ought not to be in ours
if they have retained it
by their own construction of ours
they show that to be consistent they must secede from one another whenever they shall find it the easiest way of settling their debts
or effecting any other selfish or unjust object
the principle itself is one of disintegration and upon which no government can possibly endure
if all the states save one should assert the power to drive that one out of the union
it is presumed the whole class of seceder politicians would at once deny the power and denounce the act as the greatest outrage upon state rights
but suppose that precisely the same act
instead of being called driving the one out
should be called the seceding of the others from that one
it would be exactly what the seceders claim to do
they make the point that the one
because it is a minority
may rightfully do what the others
because they are a majority
may not rightfully do
these politicians are subtle and profound on the rights of minorities
they are not partial to that power which made the constitution and speaks from the preamble calling itself we
the people
it may well be questioned whether there is to day a majority of the legally qualified voters of any state except perhaps south carolina in favor of disunion
there is much reason to believe that the union men are the majority in many
if not in every other one
of the so called seceded states
the contrary has not been demonstrated in any one of them
it is ventured to affirm this even of virginia and tennessee for the result of an election held in military camps
where the bayonets are all on one side of the question voted upon
can scarcely be considered as demonstrating popular sentiment
at such an election
all that large class who are at once for the union and against coercion would be coerced to vote against the union
it may be affirmed without extravagance that the free institutions we enjoy have developed the powers and improved the condition of our whole people beyond any example in the world
of this we now have a striking and an impressive illustration
so large an army as the government has now on foot was never before known without a soldier in it but who has taken his place there of his own free choice
but more than this
there are many single regiments whose members
one and another
possess full practical knowledge of all the arts
and whatever else
whether useful or elegant
is known in the world and there is scarcely one from which there could not be selected a president
a cabinet
a congress
and perhaps a court
abundantly competent to administer the government itself
nor do i say this is not true also in the army of our late friends
now adversaries in this contest but if it is
so much better the reason why the government which has conferred such benefits on both them and us should not be broken up
whoever in any section proposes to abandon such a government would do well to consider in deference to what principle it is that he does it what better he is likely to get in its stead whether the substitute will give
or be intended to give
so much of good to the people
there are some foreshadowings on this subject
our adversaries have adopted some declarations of independence in which
unlike the good old one
penned by jefferson
they omit the words all men are created equal
why
they have adopted a temporary national constitution
in the preamble of which
unlike our good old one
signed by washington
they omit we
the people
and substitute
the deputies of the sovereign and independent states
why
why this deliberate pressing out of view the rights of men and the authority of the people
this is essentially a people's contest
on the side of the union it is a struggle for maintaining in the world that form and substance of government whose leading object is to elevate the condition of men to lift artificial weights from all shoulders to clear the paths of laudable pursuit for all to afford all an unfettered start
and a fair chance in the race of life
yielding to partial and temporary departures
from necessity this is the leading object of the government for whose existence we contend
i am most happy to believe that the plain people understand and appreciate this
it is worthy of note that
while in this the government's hour of trial large numbers of those in the army and navy who have been favored with the offices have resigned and proved false to the hand which had pampered them
not one common soldier or common sailor is known to have deserted his flag
great honor is due to those officers who remained true
despite the example of their treacherous associates but the greatest honor
and most important fact of all
is the unanimous firmness of the common soldiers and common sailors
to the last man
so far as known
they have successfully resisted the traitorous efforts of those whose commands
but an hour before
they obeyed as absolute law
this is the patriotic instinct of the plain people
they understand
without an argument
that the destroying of the government which was made by washington means no good to them
our popular government has often been called an experiment
two points in it our people have already settled the successful establishing and the successful administering of it
one still remains its successful maintenance against a formidable internal attempt to overthrow it
it is now for them to demonstrate to the world that those who can fairly carry an election can also suppress a rebellion that ballots are the rightful and peaceful successors of bullets and that when ballots have fairly and constitutionally decided
there can be no successful appeal back to bullets that there can be no successful appeal
except to ballots themselves
at succeeding elections
such will be a great lesson of peace
teaching men that what they cannot take by an election
neither can they take it by a war teaching all the folly of being the beginners of a war
lest there be some uneasiness in the minds of candid men as to what is to be the course of the government toward the southern states after the rebellion shall have been suppressed
the executive deems it proper to say it will be his purpose then
as ever
to be guided by the constitution and the laws and that he probably will have no different understanding of the powers and duties of the federal government relatively to the rights of the states and the people
under the constitution
than that expressed in the inaugural address
he desires to preserve the government
that it may be administered for all as it was administered by the men who made it
loyal citizens everywhere have the right to claim this of their government
and the government has no right to withhold or neglect it
it is not perceived that in giving it there is any coercion
any conquest
or any subjugation
in any just sense of those terms
the constitution provides
and all the states have accepted the provision
that the united states shall guarantee to every state in this union a republican form of government
but if a state may lawfully go out of the union
having done so it may also discard the republican form of government
so that to prevent its going out is an indispensable means to the end of maintaining the guarantee mentioned and when an end is lawful and obligatory
the indispensable means to it are also lawful and obligatory
it was with the deepest regret that the executive found the duty of employing the war power in defense of the government forced upon him
he could but perform this duty or surrender the existence of the government
no compromise by public servants could
in this case
be a cure not that compromises are not often proper
but that no popular government can long survive a marked precedent that those who carry an election can only save the government from immediate destruction by giving up the main point upon which the people gave the election
the people themselves
and not their servants
can safely reverse their own deliberate decisions
as a private citizen the executive could not have consented that these institutions shall perish much less could he in betrayal of so vast and so sacred a trust as these free people had confided to him
he felt that he had no moral right to shrink
nor even to count the chances of his own life
in what might follow
in full view of his great responsibility he has
so far
done what he has deemed his duty
you will now
according to your own judgment
perform yours
he sincerely hopes that your views and your action may so accord with his as to assure all faithful citizens who have been disturbed in their rights of a certain and speedy restoration to them
under the constitution and the laws
and having thus chosen our course
without guile and with pure purpose
let us renew our trust in god
and go forward without fear and with manly hearts

the within paper
as you see
is by hon
john s
phelps and hon
frank p
both members of the present congress from missouri
the object is to get up an efficient force of missourians in the southwestern part of the state
it ought to be done
and mr
phelps ought to have general superintendence of it
i see by a private report to me from the department that eighteen regiments are already accepted from missouri
can it not be arranged that part of them not yet organized
as i understand may be taken from the locality mentioned and put under the control of mr
and let him have discretion to accept them for a shorter term than three years or the war understanding
that he will get them for the full term if he can
i hope this can be done
because mr
phelps is too zealous and efficient and understands his ground too well for us to lose his service
of course provision for arming
must be made
phelps is here
and wishes to carry home with him authority for this matter

lincoln proclamation of a national fast day
august 12
by the president of the united states of america a proclamation
whereas a joint committee of both houses of congress has waited on the president of the united states and requested him to recommend a day of public humiliation
and fasting to be observed by the people of the united states with religious solemnities and the offering of fervent supplications to almighty god for the safety and welfare of these states
his blessings on their arms
and a speedy restoration of peace and whereas it is fit and becoming in all people at all times to acknowledge and revere the supreme government of god
to bow in humble submission to his chastisements
to confess and deplore their sins and transgressions in the full conviction that the fear of the lord is the beginning of wisdom
and to pray with all fervency and contrition for the pardon of their past offences and for a blessing upon their present and prospective action and whereas when our own beloved country
by the blessing of god
and happy
is now afflicted with faction and civil war
it is peculiarly fit for us to recognize the hand of god in this terrible visitation
and in sorrowful remembrance of our own faults and crimes as a nation and as individuals to humble ourselves before him and to pray for his mercy to pray that we may be spared further punishment
though most justly deserved
that our arms may be blessed and made effectual for the re establishment of order
and peace throughout the wide extent of our country
and that the inestimable boon of civil and religious liberty
earned under his guidance and blessing by the labors and sufferings of our fathers
may be restored in all its original excellence
therefore i
abraham lincoln
president of the united states
do appoint the last thursday in september next as a day of humiliation
and fasting for all the people of the nation
and i do earnestly recommend to all the people
and especially to all ministers and teachers of religion of all denominations and to all heads of families
to observe and keep that day according to their several creeds and modes of worship in all humility and with all religious solemnity
to the end that the united prayer of the nation may ascend to the throne of grace and bring down plentiful blessings upon our country

my dear sir
unless there be reason to the contrary
not known to me
make out a commission for simon b
of kentucky
as a brigadier general of volunteers
it is to be put into the hands of general anderson
and delivered to general buckner or not
at the discretion of general anderson
of course it is to remain a secret unless and until the commission is delivered
yours truly
lincoln same day made
to governor magoffin
august 24
1861 to his excellency b
governor of the state of kentucky
your letter of the 19th instant
in which you urge the removal from the limits of kentucky of the military force now organized and in camp within that state
is received
i may not possess full and precisely accurate knowledge upon this subject but i believe it is true that there is a military force in camp within kentucky
acting by authority of the united states
which force is not very large
and is not now being augmented
i also believe that some arms have been furnished to this force by the united states
i also believe this force consists exclusively of kentuckians
having their camp in the immediate vicinity of their own homes
and not assailing or menacing any of the good people of kentucky
in all i have done in the premises i have acted upon the urgent solicitation of many kentuckians
and in accordance with what i believed
and still believe
to be the wish of a majority of all the union loving people of kentucky
while i have conversed on this subject with many eminent men of kentucky
including a large majority of her members of congress
i do not remember that any one of them
or any other person
except your excellency and the bearers of your excellency's letter
has urged me to remove the military force from kentucky or to disband it
one other very worthy citizen of kentucky did solicit me to have the augmenting of the force suspended for a time
taking all the means within my reach to form a judgment
i do not believe it is the popular wish of kentucky that this force shall be removed beyond her limits and
with this impression
i must respectfully decline to so remove it
i most cordially sympathize with your excellency in the wish to preserve the peace of my own native state
it is with regret i search
and cannot find
in your not very short letter
any declaration or intimation that you entertain any desire for the preservation of the federal union
your obedient servant
to general fremont
september 2
1861 major general fremont
my dear sir
two points in your proclamation of august 30 give me some anxiety
should you shoot a man
according to the proclamation
the confederates would very certainly shoot our best men in their hands in retaliation and so
man for man
it is
my order that you allow no man to be shot under the proclamation without first having my approbation or consent
i think there is great danger that the closing paragraph
in relation to the confiscation of property and the liberating slaves of traitorous owners

1861 major general john c
yours of the 8th
in answer to mine of the 2d instant
is just received
assuming that you
upon the ground
could better judge of the necessities of your position than i could at this distance
on seeing your proclamation of august 30 i perceived no general objection to it
the particular clause
in relation to the confiscation of property and the liberation of slaves appeared to me to be objectionable in its nonconformity to the act of congress passed the 6th of last august upon the same subjects and hence i wrote you
expressing my wish that that clause should be modified accordingly
your answer
just received
expresses the preference on your part that i should make an open order for the modification
which i very cheerfully do
it is therefore ordered that the said clause of said proclamation be so modified
and construed as to conform to
and not to transcend
the provisions on the same subject contained in the act of congress entitled an act to confiscate property used for insurrectionary purposes
approved august 6
and that said act be published at length with this order

my dear madam
your two notes of to day are before me
i answered the letter you bore me from general fremont on yesterday
and not hearing from you during the day
i sent the answer to him by mail
it is not exactly correct
as you say you were told by the elder mr
to say that i sent postmaster general blair to st
louis to examine into that department and report
postmaster general blair did go
with my approbation
to see and converse with general fremont as a friend
i do not feel authorized to furnish you with copies of letters in my possession without the consent of the writers
no impression has been made on my mind against the honor or integrity of general fremont
and i now enter my protest against being understood as acting in any hostility toward him

dear sir
yours of this day in relation to the late proclamation of general fremont is received yesterday i addressed a letter to him
by mail
on the same subject
and which is to be made public when he receives it
i herewith send you a copy of that letter
which perhaps shows my position as distinctly as any new one i could write
i will thank you not to make it public until general fremont shall have had time to receive the original

dear sir
since conversing with you i have concluded to request you to frame an order for recruiting north carolinians at fort hatteras
i suggest it to be so framed as for us to accept a smaller force even a company if we cannot get a regiment or more
what is necessary to now say about officers you will judge
governor seward says he has a nephew clarence a
i believe who would be willing to go and play colonel and assist in raising the force
still it is to be considered whether the north carolinians will not prefer officers of their own
i should expect they would

1861 hon
my dear sir
yours of the 17th is just received and coming from you
i confess it astonishes me
that you should object to my adhering to a law which you had assisted in making and presenting to me less than a month before is odd enough
but this is a very small part
general fremont's proclamation as to confiscation of property and the liberation of slaves is purely political and not within the range of military law or necessity
if a commanding general finds a necessity to seize the farm of a private owner for a pasture
an encampment
or a fortification
he has the right to do so
and to so hold it as long as the necessity lasts and this is within military law
because within military necessity
but to say the farm shall no longer belong to the owner
or his heirs forever
and this as well when the farm is not needed for military purposes as when it is
is purely political
without the savor of military law about it
and the same is true of slaves
if the general needs them
he can seize them and use them but when the need is past
it is not for him to fix their permanent future condition
that must be settled according to laws made by law makers
and not by military proclamations
the proclamation in the point in question is simply dictatorship
it assumes that the general may do anything he pleases confiscate the lands and free the slaves of loyal people
as well as of disloyal ones
and going the whole figure
i have no doubt
would be more popular with some thoughtless people than that which has been done
but i cannot assume this reckless position
nor allow others to assume it on my responsibility
you speak of it as being the only means of saving the government
on the contrary
it is itself the surrender of the government
can it be pretended that it is any longer the government of the united states any government of constitution and laws wherein a general or a president may make permanent rules of property by proclamation
i do not say congress might not with propriety pass a law on the point
just such as general fremont proclaimed
i do not say i might not
as a member of congress
vote for it
what i object to is
that i
as president
shall expressly or impliedly seize and exercise the permanent legislative functions of the government
so much as to principle
now as to policy
no doubt the thing was popular in some quarters
and would have been more so if it had been a general declaration of emancipation
the kentucky legislature would not budge till that proclamation was modified and general anderson telegraphed me that on the news of general fremont having actually issued deeds of manumission
a whole company of our volunteers threw down their arms and disbanded
i was so assured as to think it probable that the very arms we had furnished kentucky would be turned against us
i think to lose kentucky is nearly the same as to lose the whole game
kentucky gone
we cannot hold missouri
as i think
these all against us
and the job on our hands is too large for us
we would as well consent to separation at once
including the surrender of this capital
on the contrary
if you will give up your restlessness for new positions
and back me manfully on the grounds upon which you and other kind friends gave me the election and have approved in my public documents
we shall go through triumphantly
you must not understand i took my course on the proclamation because of kentucky
i took the same ground in a private letter to general fremont before i heard from kentucky
you think i am inconsistent because i did not also forbid general fremont to shoot men under the proclamation
i understand that part to be within military law
but i also think
and so privately wrote general fremont
that it is impolitic in this
that our adversaries have the power
and will certainly exercise it
to shoot as many of our men as we shoot of theirs
i did not say this in the public letter
because it is a subject i prefer not to discuss in the hearing of our enemies
there has been no thought of removing general fremont on any ground connected with his proclamation
and if there has been any wish for his removal on any ground
our mutual friend sam
glover can probably tell you what it was
i hope no real necessity for it exists on any ground
your friend

memorandum for a plan of campaign october 1
1861 on or about the 5th of october the exact date to be determined hereafter i wish a movement made to seize and hold a point on the railroad connecting virginia and tennessee near the mountain pass called cumberland gap
that point is now guarded against us by zollicoffer
with 6000 or 8000 rebels at barboursville ky
say twenty five miles from the gap
toward lexington
we have a force of 5000 or 6000 under general thomas
at camp dick robinson
about twenty five miles from lexington and seventy five from zollicoffer's camp
on the road between the two
there is not a railroad anywhere between lexington and the point to be seized
and along the whole length of which the union sentiment among the people largely predominates
we have military possession of the railroad from cincinnati to lexington
and from louisville to lexington
and some home guards
under general crittenden
are on the latter line
we have possession of the railroad from louisville to nashville
so far as muldraugh's hill
about forty miles
and the rebels have possession of that road all south of there
at the hill we have a force of 8000
under general sherman
and about an equal force of rebels is a very short distance south
under general buckner
we have a large force at paducah
and a smaller at port holt
both on the kentucky side
with some at bird's point
mound city
and new albany
all on the other side
and all which
with the gunboats on the river
are perhaps sufficient to guard the ohio from louisville to its mouth
about supplies of troops
my general idea is that all from wisconsin
and kansas
not now elsewhere
be left to fremont
all from indiana and michigan
not now elsewhere
be sent to anderson at louisville
all from ohio needed in western virginia be sent there
and any remainder be sent to mitchell at cincinnati
for anderson
all east of the mountains be appropriated to mcclellan and to the coast
as to movements
my idea is that the one for the coast and that on cumberland gap be simultaneous
and that in the meantime preparation
vigilant watching
and the defensive only be acted upon this
not to apply to fremont's operations in northern and middle missouri
that before these movements thomas and sherman shall respectively watch but not attack zollicoffer and buckner
that when the coast and gap movements shall be ready sherman is merely to stand fast
while all at cincinnati and all at louisville
with all on the line
concentrate rapidly at lexington
and thence to thomas's camp
joining him
and the whole thence upon the gap
it is for the military men to decide whether they can find a pass through the mountains at or near the gap which cannot be defended by the enemy with a greatly inferior force
and what is to be done in regard to this
the coast and gap movements made
generals mcclellan and fremont
in their respective departments
will avail themselves of any advantages the diversions may present
he was entirely unable to get this started
sherman would have taken an active part if given him
the others were too busy getting lines of communication guarded and discovering many critical supply items that had not been sent them
also the commanding general did not like it

assistant adjutant general
october 24
1861 to the commander of the department of the west
the command of the department of the west having devolved upon you
i propose to offer you a few suggestions
knowing how hazardous it is to bind down a distant commander in the field to specific lines and operations
as so much always depends on a knowledge of localities and passing events
it is intended
to leave a considerable margin for the exercise of your judgment and discretion
the main rebel army price's west of the mississippi is believed to have passed dade county in full retreat upon northwestern arkansas
leaving missouri almost freed from the enemy
excepting in the southeast of the state
assuming this basis of fact
it seems desirable
as you are not likely to overtake price
and are in danger of making too long a line from your own base of supplies and reinforcements
that you should give up the pursuit
halt your main army
divide it into two corps of observation
one occupying sedalia and the other rolla
the present termini of railroads then recruit the condition of both corps by re establishing and improving their discipline and instructions
perfecting their clothing and equipments
and providing less uncomfortable quarters
of course
both railroads must be guarded and kept open
judiciously employing just so much force as is necessary for this
from these two points
sedalia and rolla
and especially in judicious cooperation with lane on the kansas border
it would be so easy to concentrate and repel any army of the enemy returning on missouri from the southwest
that it is not probable any such attempt will be made before or during the approaching cold weather
before spring the people of missouri will probably be in no favorable mood to renew for next year the troubles which have so much afflicted and impoverished them during this
if you adopt this line of policy
and if
as i anticipate
you will see no enemy in great force approaching
you will have a surplus of force which you can withdraw from these points and direct to others as may be needed
the railroads furnishing ready means of reinforcing these main points if occasion requires
doubtless local uprisings will for a time continue to occur
but these can be met by detachments and local forces of our own
and will ere long tire out of themselves
as stated in the beginning of the letter
a large discretion must be and is left with yourself
i feel sure that an indefinite pursuit of price or an attempt by this long and circuitous route to reach memphis will be exhaustive beyond endurance
and will end in the loss of the whole force engaged in it

executive mansion
november 5
the governor of the state of missouri
acting under the direction of the convention of that state
proposes to the government of the united states that he will raise a military force to serve within the state as state militia during the war there
to cooperate with the troops in the service of the united states in repelling the invasion of the state and suppressing rebellion therein the said state militia to be embodied and to be held in the camp and in the field
and governed according to the army regulations and subject to the articles of war the said state militia not to be ordered out of the state except for the immediate defense of the state of missouri
but to co operate with the troops in the service of the united states in military operations within the state or necessary to its defense
and when officers of the state militia act with officers in the service of the united states of the same grade the officers of the united states service shall command the combined force the state militia to be armed
and paid by the united states during such time as they shall be actually engaged as an embodied military force in service in accordance with regulations of the united states army or general orders as issued from time to time
in order that the treasury of the united states may not be burdened with the pay of unnecessary officers
the governor proposes that
although the state law requires him to appoint upon the general staff an adjutant general
a commissary general
an inspector general
a quartermaster general
a paymaster general
and a surgeon general
each with the rank of colonel of cavalry
yet he proposes that the government of the united states pay only the adjutant general
the quartermaster general
and inspector general
their services being necessary in the relations which would exist between the state militia and the united states
the governor further proposes that while he is allowed by the state law to appoint aides de camp to the governor at his discretion
with the rank of colonel
three only shall be reported to the united states for payment
he also proposes that the state militia shall be commanded by a single major general and by such number of brigadier generals as shall allow one for a brigade of not less than four regiments
and that no greater number of staff officers shall be appointed for regimental
and division duties than as provided for in the act of congress of the 22d july
1861 and that
whatever be the rank of such officers as fixed by the law of the state
the compensation that they shall receive from the united states shall only be that which belongs to the rank given by said act of congress to officers in the united states service performing the same duties
the field officers of a regiment in the state militia are one colonel
one lieutenant colonel
and one major
and the company officers are a captain
a first lieutenant
and a second lieutenant
the governor proposes that
as the money to be disbursed is the money of the united states
such staff officers in the service of the united states as may be necessary to act as disbursing officers for the state militia shall be assigned by the war department for that duty or
if such cannot be spared from their present duty
he will appoint such persons disbursing officers for the state militia as the president of the united states may designate
such regulations as may be required
in the judgment of the president
to insure regularity of returns and to protect the united states from any fraudulent practices shall be observed and obeyed by all in office in the state militia
the above propositions are accepted on the part of the united states
and the secretary of war is directed to make the necessary orders upon the ordnance
and medical departments to carry this agreement into effect
he will cause the necessary staff officers in the united states service to be detailed for duty in connection with the missouri state militia
and will order them to make the necessary provision in their respective offices for fulfilling this agreement
all requisitions upon the different officers of the united states under this agreement to be made in substance in the same mode for the missouri state militia as similar requisitions are made for troops in the service of the united states and the secretary of war will cause any additional regulations that may be necessary to insure regularity and economy in carrying this agreement into effect to be adopted and communicated to the governor of missouri for the government of the missouri state militia
november 6
this plan approved
with the modification that the governor stipulates that when he commissions a major general of militia it shall be the same person at the time in command of the united states department of the west and in case the united states shall change such commander of the department
he the governor will revoke the state commission given to the person relieved and give one to the person substituted to the united states command of said department

november 21
1861 dear governor
i have thought over the interview which mr
gilmore has had with mr
and the proposal that greeley has made to gilmore
that he gilmore shall communicate to him greeley all that he learns from you of the inner workings of the administration
in return for his greeley's giving such aid as he can to the new magazine
and allowing you walker from time to time the use of his greeley's columns when it is desirable to feel of
or forestall
public opinion on important subjects
the arrangement meets my unqualified approval
and i shall further it to the extent of my ability
by opening to you as i do now fully the policy of the government
its present views and future intentions when formed
giving you permission to communicate them to gilmore for greeley and in case you go to europe i will give these things direct to gilmore
but all this must be on the express and explicit understanding that the fact of these communications coming from me shall be absolutely confidential
not to be disclosed by greeley to his nearest friend
or any of his subordinates
he will be
in effect
my mouthpiece
but i must not be known to be the speaker
i need not tell you that i have the highest confidence in mr
he is a great power
having him firmly behind me will be as helpful to me as an army of one hundred thousand men
this was to be most severely regretted
when greeley became a traitor to the cause
editorialized for compromise and separation and promoted mcclellan as democratic candidate for the presidency
that he has ever kicked the traces has been owing to his not being fully informed
tell gilmore to say to him that
if he ever objects to my policy
i shall be glad to have him state to me his views frankly and fully
i shall adopt his if i can
if i cannot
i will at least tell him why
he and i should stand together
and let no minor differences come between us for we both seek one end
which is the saving of our country
this is a longer letter than i have written in a month
longer than i would have written for any other man than horace greeley
your friend
the sooner gilmore sees greeley the better
as you may before long think it wise to ventilate our policy on the trent affair

annual message to congress
december 3
1861 fellow citizens of the senate and house of representatives
in the midst of unprecedented political troubles we have cause of great gratitude to god for unusual good health and most abundant harvests
you will not be surprised to learn that in the peculiar exigencies of the times our intercourse with foreign nations has been attended with profound solicitude
chiefly turning upon our own domestic affairs
a disloyal portion of the american people have during the whole year been engaged in an attempt to divide and destroy the union
a nation which endures factious domestic division is exposed to disrespect abroad
and one party
if not both
is sure sooner or later to invoke foreign intervention
nations thus tempted to interfere are not always able to resist the counsels of seeming expediency and ungenerous ambition
although measures adopted under such influences seldom fail to be unfortunate and injurious to those adopting them
the disloyal citizens of the united states who have offered the ruin of our country in return for the aid and comfort which they have invoked abroad have received less patronage and encouragement than they probably expected
if it were just to suppose
as the insurgents have seemed to assume
that foreign nations in this case
discarding all moral
and treaty obligations
would act solely and selfishly for the most speedy restoration of commerce
including especially the acquisition of cotton
those nations appear as yet not to have seen their way to their object more directly or clearly through the destruction than through the preservation of the union
if we could dare to believe that foreign nations are actuated by no higher principle than this
i am quite sure a sound argument could be made to show them that they can reach their aim more readily and easily by aiding to crush this rebellion than by giving encouragement to it
the principal lever relied on by the insurgents for exciting foreign nations to hostility against us
as already intimated
is the embarrassment of commerce
those nations
not improbably saw from the first that it was the union which made as well our foreign as our domestic commerce
they can scarcely have failed to perceive that the effort for disunion produces the existing difficulty
and that one strong nation promises more durable peace and a more extensive
and reliable commerce than can the same nation broken into hostile fragments
it is not my purpose to review our discussions with foreign states
whatever might be their wishes or dispositions
the integrity of our country and the stability of our government mainly depend not upon them
but on the loyalty
and intelligence of the american people
the correspondence itself
with the usual reservations
is herewith submitted
i venture to hope it will appear that we have practiced prudence and liberality toward foreign powers
averting causes of irritation and with firmness maintaining our own rights and honor
it is apparent that here
as in every other state
foreign dangers necessarily attend domestic difficulties
i recommend that adequate and ample measures be adopted for maintaining the public defenses on every side
while under this general recommendation provision for defending our seacoast line readily occurs to the mind
i also in the same connection ask the attention of congress to our great lakes and rivers
it is believed that some fortifications and depots of arms and munitions
with harbor and navigation improvements
all at well selected points upon these
would be of great importance to the national defense and preservation i ask attention to the views of the secretary of war
expressed in his report
upon the same general subject
i deem it of importance that the loyal regions of east tennessee and western north carolina should be connected with kentucky and other faithful parts of the union by rail road
i therefore recommend
as a military measure
that congress provide for the construction of such rail road as speedily as possible
kentucky will no doubt co operate
and through her legislature make the most judicious selection of a line
the northern terminus must connect with some existing railroad
and whether the route shall be from lexington or nicholasville to the cumberland gap
or from lebanon to the tennessee line
in the direction of knoxville
or on some still different line
can easily be determined
kentucky and the general government co operating
the work can be completed in a very short time
and when done it will be not only of vast present usefulness but also a valuable permanent improvement
worth its cost in all the future
some treaties
designed chiefly for the interests of commerce
and having no grave political importance
have been negotiated
and will be submitted to the senate for their consideration
although we have failed to induce some of the commercial powers to adopt a desirable melioration of the rigor of maritime war
we have removed all obstructions from the way of this humane reform except such as are merely of temporary and accidental occurrence
i invite your attention to the correspondence between her britannic majesty's minister accredited to this government and the secretary of state relative to the detention of the british ship perthshire in june last by the united states steamer massachusetts for a supposed breach of the blockade
as this detention was occasioned by an obvious misapprehension of the facts
and as justice requires that we should commit no belligerent act not founded in strict right as sanctioned by public law
i recommend that an appropriation be made to satisfy the reasonable demand of the owners of the vessel for her detention
i repeat the recommendation of my predecessor in his annual message to congress in december last in regard to the disposition of the surplus which will probably remain after satisfying the claims of american citizens against china
pursuant to the awards of the commissioners under the act of the 3d of march
it should not be deemed advisable to carry that recommendation into effect
i would suggest that authority be given for investing the principal
or the proceeds of the surplus referred to
in good securities
with a view to the satisfaction of such other just claims of our citizens against china as are not unlikely to arise hereafter in the course of our extensive trade with that empire
by the act of the 5th of august last congress authorized the president to instruct the commanders of suitable vessels to defend themselves against and to capture pirates
his authority has been exercised in a single instance only
for the more effectual protection of our extensive and valuable commerce in the eastern seas especially
it seems to me that it would also be advisable to authorize the commanders of sailing vessels to recapture any prizes which pirates may make of united states vessels and their cargoes
and the consular courts now established by law in eastern countries to adjudicate the cases in the event that this should not be objected to by the local authorities
if any good reason exists why we should persevere longer in withholding our recognition of the independence and sovereignty of haiti and liberia
i am unable to discern it
to inaugurate a novel policy in regard to them without the approbation of congress
i submit for your consideration the expediency of an appropriation for maintaining a charge d'affaires near each of those new states
it does not admit of doubt that important commercial advantages might be secured by favorable treaties with them
the operations of the treasury during the period which has elapsed since your adjournment have been conducted with signal success
the patriotism of the people has placed at the disposal of the government the large means demanded by the public exigencies
much of the national loan has been taken by citizens of the industrial classes
whose confidence in their country's faith and zeal for their country's deliverance from present peril have induced them to contribute to the support of the government the whole of their limited acquisitions
this fact imposes peculiar obligations to economy in disbursement and energy in action
the revenue from all sources
including loans
for the financial year ending on the 30th of june
was 86
and the expenditures for the same period
including payments on account of the public debt
were 84
leaving a balance in the treasury on the 1st of july of 2
for the first quarter of the financial year ending on the 30th of september
the receipts from all sources
including the balance of the 1st of july
were 102
and the expenses 98
leaving a balance on the 1st of october
of 4
estimates for the remaining three quarters of the year and for the financial year 1863
together with his views of ways and means for meeting the demands contemplated by them
will be submitted to congress by the secretary of the treasury
it is gratifying to know that the expenditures made necessary by the rebellion are not beyond the resources of the loyal people
and to believe that the same patriotism which has thus far sustained the government will continue to sustain it till peace and union shall again bless the land
i respectfully refer to the report of the secretary of war for information respecting the numerical strength of the army and for recommendations having in view an increase of its efficiency and the well being of the various branches of the service intrusted to his care
it is gratifying to know that the patriotism of the people has proved equal to the occasion
and that the number of troops tendered greatly exceeds the force which congress authorized me to call into the field
i refer with pleasure to those portions of his report which make allusion to the creditable degree of discipline already attained by our troops and to the excellent sanitary condition of the entire army
the recommendation of the secretary for an organization of the militia upon a uniform basis is a subject of vital importance to the future safety of the country
and is commended to the serious attention of congress
the large addition to the regular army
in connection with the defection that has so considerably diminished the number of its officers
gives peculiar importance to his recommendation for increasing the corps of cadets to the greatest capacity of the military academy
by mere omission
i presume
congress has failed to provide chaplains for hospitals occupied by volunteers
this subject was brought to my notice
and i was induced to draw up the form of a letter
one copy of which
properly addressed
has been delivered to each of the persons
and at the dates respectively named and stated in a schedule
containing also the form of the letter
marked a
and herewith transmitted
these gentlemen
i understand
entered upon the duties designated at the times respectively stated in the schedule
and have labored faithfully therein ever since
i therefore recommend that they be compensated at the same rate as chaplains in the army
i further suggest that general provision be made for chaplains to serve at hospitals
as well as with regiments
the report of the secretary of the navy presents in detail the operations of that branch of the service
the activity and energy which have characterized its administration
and the results of measures to increase its efficiency and power such have been the additions
by construction and purchase
that it may almost be said a navy has been created and brought into service since our difficulties commenced
besides blockading our extensive coast
squadrons larger than ever before assembled under our flag have been put afloat and performed deeds which have increased our naval renown
i would invite special attention to the recommendation of the secretary for a more perfect organization of the navy by introducing additional grades in the service
the present organization is defective and unsatisfactory
and the suggestions submitted by the department will
it is believed
if adopted
obviate the difficulties alluded to
promote harmony
and increase the efficiency of the navy
there are three vacancies on the bench of the supreme court two by the decease of justices daniel and mclean and one by the resignation of justice campbell
i have so far forborne making nominations to fill these vacancies for reasons which i will now state
two of the outgoing judges resided within the states now overrun by revolt
so that if successors were appointed in the same localities they could not now serve upon their circuits and many of the most competent men there probably would not take the personal hazard of accepting to serve
even here
upon the supreme bench
i have been unwilling to throw all the appointments north ward
thus disabling myself from doing justice to the south on the return of peace although i may remark that to transfer to the north one which has heretofore been in the south would not
with reference to territory and population
be unjust
during the long and brilliant judicial career of judge mclean his circuit grew into an empire altogether too large for any one judge to give the courts therein more than a nominal attendance rising in population from 1
018 in 1830 to 6
405 in 1860
besides this
the country generally has outgrown our present judicial system
if uniformity was at all intended
the system requires that all the states shall be accommodated with circuit courts
attended by supreme judges
in fact
and oregon have never had any such courts
nor can this well be remedied without a change in the system
because the adding of judges to the supreme court
enough for the accommodation of all parts of the country with circuit courts
would create a court altogether too numerous for a judicial body of any sort
and the evil
if it be one
will increase as new states come into the union
circuit courts are useful or they are not useful
if useful
no state should be denied them if not useful
no state should have them
let them be provided for all or abolished as to all
three modifications occur to me
either of which
i think
would be an improvement upon our present system
let the supreme court be of convenient number in every event then
let the whole country be divided into circuits of convenient size
the supreme judges to serve in a number of them corresponding to their own number
and independent circuit judges be provided for all the rest or
let the supreme judges be relieved from circuit duties and circuit judges provided for all the circuits or
dispense with circuit courts altogether
leaving the judicial functions wholly to the district courts and an independent supreme court
i respectfully recommend to the consideration of congress the present condition of the statute laws
with the hope that congress will be able to find an easy remedy for many of the inconveniences and evils which constantly embarrass those engaged in the practical administration of them
since the organization of the government
congress has enacted some 5000 acts and joint resolutions
which fill more than 6000 closely printed pages and are scattered through many volumes
many of these acts have been drawn in haste and without sufficient caution
so that their provisions are often obscure in themselves or in conflict with each other
or at least so doubtful as to render it very difficult for even the best informed persons to ascertain precisely what the statute law really is
it seems to me very important that the statute laws should be made as plain and intelligible as possible
and be reduced to as small a compass as may consist with the fullness and precision of the will of the legislature and the perspicuity of its language
this well done would
i think
greatly facilitate the labors of those whose duty it is to assist in the administration of the laws
and would be a lasting benefit to the people
by placing before them in a more accessible and intelligible form the laws which so deeply concern their interests and their duties
i am informed by some whose opinions i respect that all the acts of congress now in force and of a permanent and general nature might be revised and rewritten so as to be embraced in one volume or at most two volumes of ordinary and convenient size and i respectfully recommend to congress to consider of the subject
and if my suggestion be approved to devise such plan as to their wisdom shall seem most proper for the attainment of the end proposed
one of the unavoidable consequences of the present insurrection is the entire suppression in many places of all the ordinary means of administering civil justice by the officers and in the forms of existing law
this is the case
in whole or in part
in all the insurgent states and as our armies advance upon and take possession of parts of those states the practical evil becomes more apparent
there are no courts or officers to whom the citizens of other states may apply for the enforcement of their lawful claims against citizens of the insurgent states
and there is a vast amount of debt constituting such claims
some have estimated it as high as 200
due in large part from insurgents in open rebellion to loyal citizens who are even now making great sacrifices in the discharge of their patriotic duty to support the government
under these circumstances i have been urgently solicited to establish
by military power
courts to administer summary justice in such cases
i have thus far declined to do it
not because i had any doubt that the end proposed the collection of the debts was just and right in itself
but because i have been unwilling to go beyond the pressure of necessity in the unusual exercise of power
but the powers of congress
i suppose
are equal to the anomalous occasion
and therefore i refer the whole matter to congress
with the hope that a plan maybe devised for the administration of justice in all such parts of the insurgent states and territories as may be under the control of this government
whether by a voluntary return to allegiance and order or by the power of our arms this
not to be a permanent institution
but a temporary substitute
and to cease as soon as the ordinary courts can be reestablished in peace
it is important that some more convenient means should be provided
if possible
for the adjustment of claims against the government
especially in view of their increased number by reason of the war
it is as much the duty of government to render prompt justice against itself in favor of citizens as it is to administer the same between private individuals
the investigation and adjudication of claims in their nature belong to the judicial department
it is apparent that the attention of congress will be more than usually engaged for some time to come with great national questions
it was intended by the organization of the court of claims mainly to remove this branch of business from the halls of congress but
while the court has proved to be an effective and valuable means of investigation
it in great degree fails to effect the object of its creation for want of power to make its judgments final
fully aware of the delicacy
not to say the danger of the subject
i commend to your careful consideration whether this power of making judgments final may not properly be given to the court
reserving the right of appeal on questions of law to the supreme court
with such other provisions as experience may have shown to be necessary
i ask attention to the report of the postmaster general
the following being a summary statement of the condition of the department
the revenue from all sources during the fiscal year ending june 30
including the annual permanent appropriation of 700
000 for the transportation of free mail matter
was 9
being about 2 per cent
less than the revenue for 1860
the expenditures were 13
showing a decrease of more than 8 per cent
as compared with those of the previous year and leaving an excess of expenditure over the revenue for the last fiscal year of 4
the gross revenue for the year ending june 30
is estimated at an increase of 4 per cent
on that of 1861
making 8
to which should be added the earnings of the department in carrying free matter
making 9
the total expenditures for 1863 are estimated at 12
leaving an estimated deficiency of 3
000 to be supplied from the treasury in addition to the permanent appropriation
the present insurrection shows
i think
that the extension of this district across the potomac river at the time of establishing the capital here was eminently wise
and consequently that the relinquishment of that portion of it which lies within the state of virginia was unwise and dangerous
i submit for your consideration the expediency of regaining that part of the district and the restoration of the original boundaries thereof through negotiations with the state of virginia
the report of the secretary of the interior
with the accompanying documents
exhibits the condition of the several branches of the public business pertaining to that department
the depressing influences of the insurrection have been specially felt in the operations of the patent and general land offices
the cash receipts from the sales of public lands during the past year have exceeded the expenses of our land system only about 200
the sales have been entirely suspended in the southern states
while the interruptions to the business of the country and the diversion of large numbers of men from labor to military service have obstructed settlements in the new states and territories of the northwest
the receipts of the patent office have declined in nine months about 100
00 rendering a large reduction of the force employed necessary to make it self sustaining
the demands upon the pension office will be largely increased by the insurrection
numerous applications for pensions
based upon the casualties of the existing war
have already been made
there is reason to believe that many who are now upon the pension rolls and in receipt of the bounty of the government are in the ranks of the insurgent army or giving them aid and comfort
the secretary of the interior has directed a suspension of the payment of the pensions of such persons upon proof of their disloyalty
i recommend that congress authorize that officer to cause the names of such persons to be stricken from the pension rolls
the relations of the government with the indian tribes have been greatly disturbed by the insurrection
especially in the southern superintendency and in that of new mexico
the indian country south of kansas is in the possession of insurgents from texas and arkansas
the agents of the united states appointed since the 4th of march for this superintendency have been unable to reach their posts
while the most of those who were in office before that time have espoused the insurrectionary cause
and assume to exercise the powers of agents by virtue of commissions from the insurrectionists
it has been stated in the public press that a portion of those indians have been organized as a military force and are attached to the army of the insurgents
although the government has no official information upon this subject
letters have been written to the commissioner of indian affairs by several prominent chiefs giving assurance of their loyalty to the united states and expressing a wish for the presence of federal troops to protect them
it is believed that upon the repossession of the country by the federal forces the indians will readily cease all hostile demonstrations and resume their former relations to the government
confessedly the largest interest of the nation
has not a department nor a bureau
but a clerkship only
assigned to it in the government
while it is fortunate that this great interest is so independent in its nature as not to have demanded and extorted more from the government
i respectfully ask congress to consider whether something more cannot be given voluntarily with general advantage
annual reports exhibiting the condition of our agriculture
and manufactures would present a fund of information of great practical value to the country
while i make no suggestion as to details
i venture the opinion that an agricultural and statistical bureau might profitably be organized
the execution of the laws for the suppression of the african slave trade has been confided to the department of the interior
it is a subject of gratulation that the efforts which have been made for the suppression of this inhuman traffic have been recently attended with unusual success
five vessels being fitted out for the slave trade have been seized and condemned
two mates of vessels engaged in the trade and one person in equipping a vessel as a slaver have been convicted and subjected to the penalty of fine and imprisonment
and one captain
taken with a cargo of africans on board his vessel
has been convicted of the highest grade of offense under our laws
the punishment of which is death
the territories of colorado
and nevada
created by the last congress
have been organized
and civil administration has been inaugurated therein under auspices especially gratifying when it is considered that the leaven of treason was found existing in some of these new countries when the federal officers arrived there
the abundant natural resources of these territories
with the security and protection afforded by organized government
will doubtless invite to them a large immigration when peace shall restore the business of the country to its accustomed channels
i submit the resolutions of the legislature of colorado
which evidence the patriotic spirit of the people of the territory
so far the authority of the united states has been upheld in all the territories
as it is hoped it will be in the future
i commend their interests and defense to the enlightened and generous care of congress
i recommend to the favorable consideration of congress the interests of the district of columbia
the insurrection has been the cause of much suffering and sacrifice to its inhabitants
and as they have no representative in congress that body should not overlook their just claims upon the government
at your late session a joint resolution was adopted authorizing the president to take measures for facilitating a proper representation of the industrial interests of the united states at the exhibition of the industry of all nations to be holden at london in the year 1862
i regret to say i have been unable to give personal attention to this subject a subject at once so interesting in itself and so extensively and intimately connected with the material prosperity of the world
through the secretaries of state and of the interior a plan or system has been devised and partly matured
and which will be laid before you
under and by virtue of the act of congress entitled an act to confiscate property used for insurrectionary purposes
approved august 6
the legal claims of certain persons to the labor and service of certain other persons have become forfeited
and numbers of the latter thus liberated are already dependent on the united states
and must be provided for in some way
besides this
it is not impossible that some of the states will pass similar enactments for their own benefit respectively
and by operation of which persons of the same class will be thrown upon them for disposal
in such case i recommend that congress provide for accepting such persons from such states
according to some mode of valuation
in lieu
pro tanto
of direct taxes
or upon some other plan to be agreed on with such states respectively that such persons
on such acceptance by the general government
be at once deemed free
and that in any event steps be taken for colonizing both classes or the one first mentioned if the other shall not be brought into existence at some place or places in a climate congenial to them
it might be well to consider
whether the free colored people already in the united states could not
so far as individuals may desire
be included in such colonization
to carry out the plan of colonization may involve the acquiring of territory
and also the appropriation of money beyond that to be expended in the territorial acquisition
having practised the acquisition of territory for nearly sixty years
the question of constitutional power to do so is no longer an open one with us
the power was questioned at first by mr
in the purchase of louisiana
yielded his scruples on the plea of great expediency
if it be said that the only legitimate object of acquiring territory is to furnish homes for white men
this measure effects that object
for emigration of colored men leaves additional room for white men remaining or coming here
placed the importance of procuring louisiana more on political and commercial grounds than on providing room for population
on this whole proposition
including the appropriation of money with the acquisition of territory
does not the expediency amount to absolute necessity that without which the government itself cannot be perpetuated
the war continues
in considering the policy to be adopted for suppressing the insurrection i have been anxious and careful that the inevitable conflict for this purpose shall not degenerate into a violent and remorseless revolutionary struggle
i have therefore in every case thought it proper to keep the integrity of the union prominent as the primary object of the contest on our part
leaving all questions which are not of vital military importance to the more deliberate action of the legislature
in the exercise of my best discretion i have adhered to the blockade of the ports held by the insurgents
instead of putting in force by proclamation the law of congress enacted at the late session for closing those ports
so also
obeying the dictates of prudence
as well as the obligations of law
instead of transcending i have adhered to the act of congress to confiscate property used for insurrectionary purposes
if a new law upon the same subject shall be proposed
its propriety will be duly considered
the union must be preserved
and hence all indispensable means must be employed
we should not be in haste to determine that radical and extreme measures
which may reach the loyal as well as the disloyal
are indispensable
the inaugural address at the beginning of the administration and the message to congress at the late special session were both mainly devoted to topics domestic controversy out of which the insurrection and consequent war have sprung
nothing now occurs to add or subtract to or from the principles or general purposes stated and expressed in those documents
the last ray of hope for preserving the union peaceably expired at the assault upon fort sumter
and a general review of what has occurred since may not be unprofitable
what was painfully uncertain then is much better defined and more distinct now
and the progress of events is plainly in the right direction
the insurgents confidently claimed a strong support from north of mason and dixon's line
and the friends of the union were not free from apprehension on the point
was soon settled definitely
and on the right side
south of the line noble little delaware led off right from the first
maryland was made to seem against the union
our soldiers were assaulted
bridges were burned
and railroads torn up within her limits
and we were many days at one time without the ability to bring a single regiment over her soil to the capital
now her bridges and railroads are repaired and open to the government she already gives seven regiments to the cause of the union
and none to the enemy and her people
at a regular election
have sustained the union by a larger majority and a larger aggregate vote than they ever before gave to any candidate or any question
for some time in doubt
is now decidedly and
i think
unchangeably ranged on the side of the union
missouri is comparatively quiet
i believe
not again be overrun by the insurrectionists
these three states of maryland
and missouri
neither of which would promise a single soldier at first
have now an aggregate of not less than forty thousand in the field for the union
while of their citizens certainly not more than a third of that number
and they of doubtful whereabouts and doubtful existence
are in arms against us
after a somewhat bloody struggle of months
winter closes on the union people of western virginia
leaving them masters of their own country
an insurgent force of about fifteen hundred
for months dominating the narrow peninsular region constituting the counties of accomac and northampton
and known as eastern shore of virginia
together with some contiguous parts of maryland
have laid down their arms
and the people there have renewed their allegiance to and accepted the protection of the old flag
this leaves no armed insurrectionist north of the potomac or east of the chesapeake
also we have obtained a footing at each of the isolated points on the southern coast of hatteras
port royal
tybee island near savannah
and ship island and we likewise have some general accounts of popular movements in behalf of the union in north carolina and tennessee
these things demonstrate that the cause of the union is advancing steadily and certainly southward
since your last adjournment lieutenant general scott has retired from the head of the army
during his long life the nation has not been unmindful of his merit yet on calling to mind how faithfully
and brilliantly he has served the country
from a time far back in our history
when few of the now living had been born
and thenceforward continually
i cannot but think we are still his debtors
i submit
for your consideration what further mark of recognition is due to him
and to ourselves as a grateful people
with the retirement of general scott came the executive duty of appointing in his stead a general in chief of the army
it is a fortunate circumstance that neither in council nor country was there
so far as i know
any difference of opinion as to the proper person to be selected
the retiring chief repeatedly expressed his judgment in favor of general mcclellan for the position
and in this the nation seemed to give a unanimous concurrence
the designation of general mcclellan is therefore in considerable degree the selection of the country as well as of the executive
and hence there is better reason to hope there will be given him the confidence and cordial support thus by fair implication promised
and without which he cannot with so full efficiency serve the country
it has been said that one bad general is better than two good ones
and the saying is true if taken to mean no more than that an army is better directed by a single mind
though inferior
than by two superior ones at variance and cross purposes with each other
and the same is true in all joint operations wherein those engaged can have none but a common end in view and can differ only as to the choice of means
in a storm at sea no one on hoard can wish the ship to sink
and yet not unfrequently all go down together because too many will direct and no single mind can be allowed to control
it continues to develop that the insurrection is largely
if not exclusively
a war upon the first principle of popular government the rights of the people
conclusive evidence of this is found in the most grave and maturely considered public documents
as well as in the general tone of the insurgents
in those documents we find the abridgment of the existing right of suffrage and the denial to the people of all right to participate in the selection of public officers except the legislative boldly advocated
with labored arguments to prove that large control of the people in government is the source of all political evil
monarchy itself is sometimes hinted at as a possible refuge from the power of the people
in my present position i could scarcely be justified were i to omit raising a warning voice against this approach of returning despotism
it is not needed nor fitting here that a general argument should be made in favor of popular institutions
but there is one point
with its connections
not so hackneyed as most others
to which i ask a brief attention
it is the effort to place capital on an equal footing with
if not above
labor in the structure of government
it is assumed that labor is available only in connection with capital that nobody labors unless somebody else
owning capital
somehow by the use of it induces him to labor
this assumed
it is next considered whether it is best that capital shall hire laborers
and thus induce them to work by their own consent
or buy them and drive them to it without their consent
having proceeded so far
it is naturally concluded that all laborers are either hired laborers or what we call slaves
and further
it is assumed that whoever is once a hired laborer is fixed in that condition for life
now there is no such relation between capital and labor as assumed
nor is there any such thing as a free man being fixed for life in the condition of a hired laborer
both these assumptions are false
and all inferences from them are groundless
labor is prior to and independent of capital
capital is only the fruit of labor
and could never have existed if labor had not first existed
labor is the superior of capital
and deserves much the higher consideration
capital has its rights
which are as worthy of protection as any other rights
nor is it denied that there is
and probably always will be
a relation between labor and capital producing mutual benefits
the error is in assuming that the whole labor of community exists within that relation
a few men own capital
and that few avoid labor themselves
and with their capital hire or buy another few to labor for them
a large majority belong to neither class neither work for others nor have others working for them
in most of the southern states a majority of the whole people of all colors are neither slaves nor masters
while in the northern a large majority are neither hirers nor hired
with their families wives
and daughters
work for themselves on their farms
in their houses
and in their shops
taking the whole product to themselves
and asking no favors of capital on the one hand nor of hired laborers or slaves on the other
it is not forgotten that a considerable number of persons mingle their own labor with capital that is
they labor with their own hands and also buy or hire others to labor for them but this is only a mixed and not a distinct class
no principle stated is disturbed by the existence of this mixed class
as has already been said
there is not of necessity any such thing as the free hired laborer being fixed to that condition for life
many independent men everywhere in these states a few years back in their lives were hired laborers
the prudent
penniless beginner in the world labors for wages awhile
saves a surplus with which to buy tools or land for himself
then labors on his own account another while
and at length hires another new beginner to help him
this is the just and generous and prosperous system which opens the way to all
gives hope to all
and consequent energy and progress and improvement of condition to all
no men living are more worthy to be trusted than those who toil up from poverty none less inclined to take or touch aught which they have not honestly earned
let them beware of surrendering a political power which they already possess
and which if surrendered will surely be used to close the door of advancement against such as they and to fix new disabilities and burdens upon them till all of liberty shall be lost
from the first taking of our national census to the last are seventy years
and we find our population at the end of the period eight times as great as it was at the beginning
the increase of those other things which men deem desirable has been even greater
we thus have at one view what the popular principle
applied to government through the machinery of the states and the union
has produced in a given time
and also what if firmly maintained it promises for the future
there are already among us those who if the union be preserved will live to see it contain 200
the struggle of to day is not altogether for to day it is for a vast future also
with a reliance on providence all the more firm and earnest
let us proceed in the great task which events have devolved upon us
message to congress
december 20
to the senate and house of representatives
i transmit to congress a letter from the secretary of the executive committee of the commission appointed to represent the interests of those american citizens who may desire to become exhibitors at the industrial exhibition to be held in london in 1862
and a memorial of that commission
with a report of the executive committee thereof and copies of circulars announcing the decisions of her majesty's commissioners in london
giving directions to be observed in regard to articles intended for exhibition
and also of circular forms of application
demands for space
according to the rules prescribed by the british commissioners
as these papers fully set forth the requirements necessary to enable those citizens of the united states who may wish to become exhibitors to avail themselves of the privileges of the exhibition
i commend them to your early consideration
especially in view of the near approach of the time when the exhibition will begin
letter of reprimand to general hunter to general hunter
executive mansion
1861 major general hunter
dear sir
yours of the 23d is received
and i am constrained to say it is difficult to answer so ugly a letter in good temper
i am
as you intimate
losing much of the great confidence i placed in you
not from any act or omission of yours touching the public service
up to the time you were sent to leavenworth
but from the flood of grumbling despatches and letters i have seen from you since
i knew you were being ordered to leavenworth at the time it was done and i aver that with as tender a regard for your honor and your sensibilities as i had for my own
it never occurred to me that you were being humiliated
and disgraced nor have i
up to this day
heard an intimation that you have been wronged
coming from any one but yourself
no one has blamed you for the retrograde movement from springfield
nor for the information you gave general cameron and this you could readily understand
if it were not for your unwarranted assumption that the ordering you to leavenworth must necessarily have been done as a punishment for some fault
i thought then
and think yet
the position assigned to you is as responsible
and as honorable
as that assigned to buell i know that general mcclellan expected more important results from it
my impression is that at the time you were assigned to the new western department
it had not been determined to replace general sherman in kentucky but of this i am not certain
because the idea that a command in kentucky was very desirable
and one in the farther west undesirable
had never occurred to me
you constantly speak of being placed in command of only 3000
tell me
is this not mere impatience
have you not known all the while that you are to command four or five times that many
i have been
and am sincerely your friend and if
as such
i dare to make a suggestion
i would say you are adopting the best possible way to ruin yourself
act well your part
there all the honor lies
he who does something at the head of one regiment
will eclipse him who does nothing at the head of a hundred
your friend
as ever

general mcclellan should not yet be disturbed with business
i think you better get in concert with general halleck at once
i write you to night
i also telegraph and write halleck
to general h

january 1
1862 dear general halleck
general mcclellan is not dangerously ill
as i hope
but would better not be disturbed with business
i am very anxious that
in case of general buell's moving toward nashville
the enemy shall not be greatly reinforced
and i think there is danger he will be from columbus
it seems to me that a real or feigned attack upon columbus from up the river at the same time would either prevent this or compensate for it by throwing columbus into our hands
i wrote general buell a letter similar to this
meaning that he and you shall communicate and act in concert
unless it be your judgment and his that there is no necessity for it
you and he will understand much better than i how to do it
please do not lose time in this matter
yours very truly
to the people of maryland
in view of the recent declaration of the people of maryland of their adhesion to the union
so distinctly made in their recent election
the president directs that all the prisoners who having heretofore been arrested in that state are now detained in military custody by the president's authority
be released from their imprisonment on the following conditions
that if they were holding any civil or military offices when arrested
the terms of which have expired
they shall not resume or reclaim such office and secondly
all persons availing themselves of this proclamation shall engage by oath or parole of honor to maintain the union and the constitution of the united states
and in no way to aid or abet by arms
or information of any kind the existing insurrection against the government of the united states
to guard against misapprehension it is proper to state that this proclamation does not apply to prisoners of war

relative to a vessel for the of taking such articles as persons in this country may wish to exhibit on that occasion
as it appears no naval vessel can be spared for the purpose
i recommend that authority be given to charter a suitable merchant vessel
in order that facilities similar to those afforded by the government exhibition of 1851 may also be extended to citizens of the united states who may desire to contribute to the exhibition of this year

brigadier general buell
my dear sir
your despatch of yesterday has been received
and it disappoints and distresses me
i have shown it to general mcclellan
who says he will write you to day
i am not competent to criticize your views
and therefore what i offer is in justification of myself
of the two
i would rather have a point on the railroad south of cumberland gap than nashville
because it cuts a great artery of the enemy's communication
which nashville does not and secondly
because it is in the midst of loyal people who would rally around it
while nashville is not
i cannot see why the movement on east tennessee would not be a diversion in your favor rather than a disadvantage
assuming that a movement toward nashville is the main object
but my distress is that our friends in east tennessee are being hanged and driven to despair
and even now
i fear
are thinking of taking rebel arms for the sake of personal protection
in this we lose the most valuable stake we have in the south
my despatch
to which yours is an answer
was sent with the knowledge of senator johnson and representative maynard of east tennessee
and they will be upon me to know the answer
which i cannot safely show them
they would despair
possibly resign to go and save their families somehow
or die with them
i do not intend this to be an order in any sense
but merely
as intimated before
to show you the grounds of my anxiety
yours very truly

indorsement on letter from general halleck
january 10
headquarters department of the missouri st
january 6
to his excellency the president
in reply to your excellency's letter of the 1st instant
i have to state that on receiving your telegram i immediately communicated with general buell and have since sent him all the information i could obtain of the enemy's movements about columbus and camp beauregard
no considerable force has been sent from those places to bowling green
they have about 22
000 men at columbus
and the place is strongly fortified
i have at cairo
port holt
and paducah only about 15
after leaving guards at these places
would give me but little over 10
000 men with which to assist general buell
it would be madness to attempt anything serious with such a force
and i cannot at the present time withdraw any from missouri without risking the loss of this state
the troops recently raised in other states of this department have
without my knowledge
been sent to kentucky and kansas
i am satisfied that the authorities at washington do not appreciate the difficulties with which we have to contend here
the operations of lane
and others have so enraged the people of missouri that it is estimated that there is a majority of 80
000 against the government
we are virtually in an enemy's country
price and others have a considerable army in the southwest
against which i am operating with all my available force
this city and most of the middle and northern counties are insurrectionary
burning bridges
destroying telegraph lines
and can be kept down only by the presence of troops
a large portion of the foreign troops organized by general fremont are unreliable indeed
many of them are already mutinous
they have been tampered with by politicians
and made to believe that if they get up a mutiny and demand fremont's return the government will be forced to restore him to duty here
it is believed that some high officers are in the plot i have already been obliged to disarm several of these organizations
and i am daily expecting more serious outbreaks
another grave difficulty is the want of proper general officers to command the troops and enforce order and discipline
and especially to protect public property from robbery and plunder
some of the brigadier generals assigned to this department are entirely ignorant of their duties and unfit for any command
i assure you
it is very difficult to accomplish much with such means
i am in the condition of a carpenter who is required to build a bridge with a dull axe
a broken saw
and rotten timber
it is true that i have some very good green timber
which will answer the purpose as soon as i can get it into shape and season it a little
i know nothing of general buell's intended operations
never having received any information in regard to the general plan of campaign
if it be intended that his column shall move on bowling green while another moves from cairo or paducah on columbus or camp beauregard
it will be a repetition of the same strategic error which produced the disaster of bull run
to operate on exterior lines against an enemy occupying a central position will fail
as it always has failed
in ninety nine cases out of a hundred
it is condemned by every military authority i have ever read
general buell's army and the forces at paducah occupy precisely the same position in relation to each other and to the enemy as did the armies of mcdowell and patterson before the battle of bull run
very respectfully
your obedient servant

january 13
1861 brigadier general buell
my dear sir your despatch of yesterday is received
in which you say
i received your letter and general mcclellan's
and will at once devote my efforts to your views and his
in the midst of my many cares i have not seen
nor asked to see
general mcclellan's letter to you
for my own views
i have not offered and do not now offer them as orders and while i am glad to have them respectfully considered
i would blame you to follow them contrary to your own clear judgment
unless i should put them in the form of orders
as to general mcclellan's views
you understand your duty in regard to them better than i do
with this preliminary i state my general idea of this war to be
that we have the greater numbers and the enemy has the greater facility of concentrating forces upon points of collision that we must fail unless we can find some way of making our advantage an overmatch for his and that this can only be done by menacing him with superior forces at different points at the same time
so that we can safely attack one or both if he makes no change and if he weakens one to strengthen the other
forbear to attack the strengthened one
but seize and hold the weakened one
gaining so much
to illustrate
suppose last summer
when winchester ran away to reinforce manassas
we had forborne to attack manassas
but had seized and held winchester
i mention this to illustrate and not to criticise
i did not lose confidence in mcdowell
and i think less harshly of patterson than some others seem to
applying the principle to your case
my idea is that halleck shall menace columbus and down river generally
while you menace bowling green and east tennessee
if the enemy shall concentrate at bowling green
do not retire from his front
yet do not fight him there either
but seize columbus and east tennessee
one or both
left exposed by the concentration at bowling green
it is a matter of no small anxiety to me
and which i am sure you will not overlook
that the east tennessee line is so long and over so bad a road
yours very truly

my dear sir
the germans are true and patriotic and so far as they have got cross in missouri it is upon mistake and misunderstanding
without a knowledge of its contents
governor koerner
of illinois
will hand you this letter
he is an educated and talented german gentleman
as true a man as lives
with his assistance you can set everything right with the germans
my clear judgment is that
with reference to the german element in your command
you should have governor koerner with you and if agreeable to you and him
i will make him a brigadier general
so that he can afford to give his time
he does not wish to command in the field
though he has more military knowledge than some who do
if he goes into the place
he will simply be an efficient
and unselfish assistant to you
i say all this upon intimate personal acquaintance with governor koerner
yours very truly

suppose the enemy should attack us in force before we reach the occoquan
suppose the enemy in force shall dispute the crossing of the occoquan
in view of this
might it not be safest for us to cross the occoquan at coichester
rather than at the village of occoquan
this would cost the enemy two miles of travel to meet us
but would
on the contrary
leave us two miles farther from our ultimate destination
suppose we reach maple valley without an attack

respite for nathaniel gordon february 4
1862 a
president of the united states of america
to all to whom these presents shall come
whereas it appears that at a term of the circuit court of the united states of america for the southern district of new york held in the month of november
nathaniel gordon was indicted and convicted for being engaged in the slave trade
and was by the said court sentenced to be put to death by hanging by the neck
on friday the 7th day of february
and whereas a large number of respectable citizens have earnestly besought me to commute the said sentence of the said nathaniel gordon to a term of imprisonment for life
which application i have felt it to be my duty to refuse
and whereas it has seemed to me probable that the unsuccessful application made for the commutation of his sentence may have prevented the said nathaniel gordon from making the necessary preparation for the awful change which awaits him now

executive order no
relating to political prisoners
war department
february 14
the breaking out of a formidable insurrection based on a conflict of political ideas
being an event without precedent in the united states
was necessarily attended by great confusion and perplexity of the public mind
disloyalty before unsuspected suddenly became bold
and treason astonished the world by bringing at once into the field military forces superior in number to the standing army of the united states
every department of the government was paralyzed by treason
defection appeared in the senate
in the house of representatives
in the cabinet
in the federal courts ministers and consuls returned from foreign countries to enter the insurrectionary councils of land or naval forces commanding and other officers of the army and in the navy betrayed our councils or deserted their posts for commands in the insurgent forces
treason was flagrant in the revenue and in the post office service
as well as in the territorial governments and in the indian reserves
not only governors
and ministerial officers in the states
but even whole states rushed one after another with apparent unanimity into rebellion
the capital was besieged and its connection with all the states cut off
even in the portions of the country which were most loyal
political combinations and secret societies were formed furthering the work of disunion
from motives of disloyalty or cupidity or from excited passions or perverted sympathies
individuals were found furnishing men
and materials of war and supplies to the insurgents' military and naval forces
navy yards
military posts
and garrisons one after another were betrayed or abandoned to the insurgents
congress had not anticipated
and so had not provided for
the emergency
the municipal authorities were powerless and inactive
the judicial machinery seemed as if it had been designed
not to sustain the government
but to embarrass and betray it
foreign intervention
openly invited and industriously instigated by the abettors of the insurrection
became imminent
and has only been prevented by the practice of strict and impartial justice
with the most perfect moderation
in our intercourse with nations
the public mind was alarmed and apprehensive
though fortunately not distracted or disheartened
it seemed to be doubtful whether the federal government
which one year before had been thought a model worthy of universal acceptance
had indeed the ability to defend and maintain itself
some reverses
were unavoidable
suffered by newly levied and inefficient forces
discouraged the loyal and gave new hopes to the insurgents
voluntary enlistments seemed about to cease and desertions commenced
parties speculated upon the question whether conscription had not become necessary to fill up the armies of the united states
in this emergency the president felt it his duty to employ with energy the extraordinary powers which the constitution confides to him in cases of insurrection
he called into the field such military and naval forces
unauthorized by the existing laws
as seemed necessary
he directed measures to prevent the use of the post office for treasonable correspondence
he subjected passengers to and from foreign countries to new passport regulations
and he instituted a blockade
suspended the writ of habeas corpus in various places
and caused persons who were represented to him as being or about to engage in disloyal and treasonable practices to be arrested by special civil as well as military agencies and detained in military custody when necessary to prevent them and deter others from such practices
examinations of such cases were instituted
and some of the persons so arrested have been discharged from time to time under circumstances or upon conditions compatible
as was thought
with the public safety
meantime a favorable change of public opinion has occurred
the line between loyalty and disloyalty is plainly defined
the whole structure of the government is firm and stable
apprehension of public danger and facilities for treasonable practices have diminished with the passions which prompted heedless persons to adopt them
the insurrection is believed to have culminated and to be declining
the president
in view of these facts
and anxious to favor a return to the normal course of the administration as far as regard for the public welfare will allow
directs that all political prisoners or state prisoners now held in military custody be released on their subscribing to a parole engaging them to render no aid or comfort to the enemies in hostility to the united states
the secretary of war will
in his discretion
except from the effect of this order any persons detained as spies in the service of the insurgents
or others whose release at the present moment may be deemed incompatible with the public safety
to all persons who shall be so released
and who shall keep their parole
the president grants an amnesty for any past offences of treason or disloyalty which they may have comminuted
extraordinary arrests will hereafter be made under the direction of the military authorities alone

major general halleck
you have fort donelson safe
unless grant shall be overwhelmed from outside to prevent which latter will
i think
require all the vigilance
and skill of yourself and buell
acting in full co operation
columbus will not get at grant
but the force from bowling green will
they hold the railroad from bowling green to within a few miles of fort donelson
with the bridge at clarksville undisturbed
it is unsafe to rely that they will not dare to expose nashville to buell
a small part of their force can retire slowly toward nashville
breaking up the railroad as they go
and keep buell out of that city twenty days
meanwhile nashville will be abundantly defended by forces from all south and perhaps from hers at manassas
could not a cavalry force from general thomas on the upper cumberland dash across
almost unresisted
and cut the railroad at or near knoxville
in the midst of a bombardment at fort donelson
why could not a gunboat run up and destroy the bridge at clarksville

speech to the peruvian minister
march 4
1862 the united states have no enmities
or rivalries
and no interests which conflict with the welfare
and rights or interests of any other nation
their own prosperity
and aggrandizement are sought most safely and advantageously through the preservation not only of peace on their own part
but peace among all other nations
but while the united states are thus a friend to all other nations
they do not seek to conceal the fact that they cherish especial sentiments of friendship for
and sympathies with
those who
like themselves
have founded their institutions on the principle of the equal rights of men and such nations being more prominently neighbors of the united states
the latter are co operating with them in establishing civilization and culture on the american continent
such being the general principles which govern the united states in their foreign relations
you may be assured
that in all things this government will deal justly
if it be possible
even liberally with peru
whose liberal sentiments toward us you have so kindly expressed
message to congress recommending compensated emancipation
march 6
1862 fellow citizens of the senate and house of representatives
i recommend the adoption of a joint resolution by your honorable bodies which shall be substantially as follows
that the united states ought to co operate with any state which may adopt gradual abolishment of slavery
giving to such state pecuniary aid
to be used by such state
in its discretion
to compensate for the inconveniences
public and private
produced by such change of system
if the proposition contained in the resolution does not meet the approval of congress and the country
there is the end but if it does command such approval
i deem it of importance that the states and people immediately interested should be at once distinctly notified of the fact
so that they may begin to consider whether to accept or reject it
the federal government would find its highest interest in such a measure
as one of the most efficient means of self preservation
the leaders of the existing insurrection entertain the hope that this government will ultimately be forced to acknowledge the independence of some part of the disaffected region
and that all the slave states north of such part will then say
the union for which we have struggled being already gone
we now choose to go with the southern section
to deprive them of this hope substantially ends the rebellion
and the initiation of emancipation completely deprives them of it as to all the states initiating it
the point is not that all the states tolerating slavery would very soon
if at all
initiate emancipation but that
while the offer is equally made to all
the more northern shall by such initiation make it certain to the more southern that in no event will the former ever join the latter in their proposed confederacy
i say initiation because
in my judgment
gradual and not sudden emancipation is better for all
in the mere financial or pecuniary view
any member of congress with the census tables and treasury reports before him can readily see for himself how very soon the current expenditures of this war would purchase
at fair valuation
all the slaves in any named state
such a proposition on the part of the general government sets up no claim of a right by federal authority to interfere with slavery within state limits
as it does
the absolute control of the subject in each case to the state and its people immediately interested
it is proposed as a matter of perfectly free choice with them
in the annual message last december
i thought fit to say
the union must be preserved
and hence all indispensable means must be employed
i said this not hastily
but deliberately
war has been made and continues to be an indispensable means to this end
a practical reacknowledgment of the national authority would render the war unnecessary
and it would at once cease
resistance continues
the war must also continue and it is impossible to foresee all the incidents which may attend and all the ruin which may follow it
such as may seem indispensable or may obviously promise great efficiency toward ending the struggle must and will come
the proposition now made though an offer only
i hope it may be esteemed no offense to ask whether the pecuniary consideration tendered would not be of more value to the states and private persons concerned than are the institution and property in it in the present aspect of affairs
while it is true that the adoption of the proposed resolution would be merely initiatory
and not within itself a practical measure
it is recommended in the hope that it would soon lead to important practical results
in full view of my great responsibility to my god and to my country
i earnestly beg the attention of congress and the people to the subject

lincoln interview between the president and some border slave state representatives
by hon
memorandum dear sir
i called
at the request of the president
to ask you to come to the white house tomorrow morning
at nine o'clock
and bring such of your colleagues as are in town
washington
march 10
on my return from church
i found mr
postmaster general blair in my room
writing the above note
which he immediately suspended
and verbally communicated the president's invitation
and stated that the president's purpose was to have some conversation with the delegations of kentucky
and delaware
in explanation of his message of the 6th instant
this morning these delegations
or such of them as were in town
assembled at the white house at the appointed time
and after some little delay were admitted to an audience
leary and myself were the only members from maryland present
i think
were the only members of the delegation at that time in the city
i know that mr
of the senate
and messrs
webster and calvert
of the house
were absent
after the usual salutations
and we were seated
the president said
in substance
that he had invited us to meet him to have some conversation with us in explanation of his message of the 6th that since he had sent it in several of the gentlemen then present had visited him
but had avoided any allusion to the message
and he therefore inferred that the import of the message had been misunderstood
and was regarded as inimical to the interests we represented and he had resolved he would talk with us
and disabuse our minds of that erroneous opinion
the president then disclaimed any intent to injure the interests or wound the sensibilities of the slave states
on the contrary
his purpose was to protect the one and respect the other that we were engaged in a terrible
and tedious war immense armies were in the field
and must continue in the field as long as the war lasts that these armies must
of necessity
be brought into contact with slaves in the states we represented and in other states as they advanced that slaves would come to the camps
and continual irritation was kept up that he was constantly annoyed by conflicting and antagonistic complaints
on the one side a certain class complained if the slave was not protected by the army persons were frequently found who
participating in these views
acted in a way unfriendly to the slaveholder on the other hand
slaveholders complained that their rights were interfered with
their slaves induced to abscond and protected within the lines these complaints were numerous
loud and deep were a serious annoyance to him and embarrassing to the progress of the war that it kept alive a spirit hostile to the government in the states we represented strengthened the hopes of the confederates that at some day the border states would unite with them
and thus tend to prolong the war and he was of opinion
if this resolution should be adopted by congress and accepted by our states
these causes of irritation and these hopes would be removed
and more would be accomplished toward shortening the war than could be hoped from the greatest victory achieved by union armies that he made this proposition in good faith
and desired it to be accepted
if at all
and in the same patriotic spirit in which it was made that emancipation was a subject exclusively under the control of the states
and must be adopted or rejected by each for itself that he did not claim nor had this government any right to coerce them for that purpose that such was no part of his purpose in making this proposition
and he wished it to be clearly understood that he did not expect us there to be prepared to give him an answer
but he hoped we would take the subject into serious consideration
confer with one another
and then take such course as we felt our duty and the interests of our constituents required of us
of missouri
said that in his state slavery was not considered a permanent institution that natural causes were there in operation which would at no distant day extinguish it
and he did not think that this proposition was necessary for that and
besides that
he and his friends felt solicitous as to the message on account of the different constructions which the resolution and message had received
the new york tribune was for it
and understood it to mean that we must accept gradual emancipation according to the plan suggested
or get something worse
the president replied that he must not be expected to quarrel with the new york tribune before the right time he hoped never to have to do it he would not anticipate events
in respect to emancipation in missouri
he said that what had been observed by mr
noell was probably true
but the operation of these natural causes had not prevented the irritating conduct to which he had referred
or destroyed the hopes of the confederates that missouri would at some time merge herself alongside of them
in his judgment
the passage of this resolution by congress and its acceptance by missouri would accomplish
of maryland
asked what would be the effect of the refusal of the state to accept this proposal
and he desired to know if the president looked to any policy beyond the acceptance or rejection of this scheme
the president replied that he had no designs beyond the actions of the states on this particular subject
he should lament their refusal to accept it
but he had no designs beyond their refusal of it
of kentucky
inquired if the president thought there was any power except in the states themselves to carry out his scheme of emancipation
the president replied that he thought there could not be
he then went off into a course of remarks not qualifying the foregoing declaration nor material to be repeated to a just understanding of his meaning
crisfield said he did not think the people of maryland looked upon slavery as a permanent institution and he did not know that they would be very reluctant to give it up if provision was made to meet the loss and they could be rid of the race but they did not like to be coerced into emancipation
either by the direct action of the government or by indirection
as through the emancipation of slaves in this district
or the confiscation of southern property as now threatened and he thought before they would consent to consider this proposition they would require to be informed on these points
the president replied that
unless he was expelled by the act of god or the confederate armies he should occupy that house for three years and as long as he remained there maryland had nothing to fear either for her institutions or her interests on the points referred to
crisfield immediately added
if what you now say could be heard by the people of maryland
they would consider your proposition with a much better feeling than i fear without it they will be inclined to do
the president
that meaning a publication of what he said will not do it would force me into a quarrel before the proper time and
again intimating
as he had before done
that a quarrel with the greeley faction was impending
he said he did not wish to encounter it before the proper time
nor at all if it could be avoided
the greely faction wanted an immediate emancipation proclamation
governor wickliffe
of kentucky
then asked him respecting the constitutionality of his scheme
the president replied
as you may suppose
i have considered that and the proposition now submitted does not encounter any constitutional difficulty
it proposes simply to co operate with any state by giving such state pecuniary aid and he thought that the resolution
as proposed by him
would be considered rather as the expression of a sentiment than as involving any constitutional question
of missouri
thought that if this proposition was adopted at all it should be by the votes of the free states
and come as a proposition from them to the slave states
affording them an inducement to put aside this subject of discord that it ought not to be expected that members representing slaveholding constituencies should declare at once
and in advance of any proposition to them
for the emancipation of slavery
the president said he saw and felt the force of the objection it was a fearful responsibility
and every gentleman must do as he thought best that he did not know how this scheme was received by the members from the free states some of them had spoken to him and received it kindly but for the most part they were as reserved and chary as we had been
and he could not tell how they would vote
and in reply to some expression of mr
hall as to his own opinion regarding slavery
he said he did not pretend to disguise his anti slavery feeling that he thought it was wrong
and should continue to think so but that was not the question we had to deal with now
slavery existed
and that
as well by the act of the north as of the south and in any scheme to get rid of it the north as well as the south was morally bound to do its full and equal share
he thought the institution wrong and ought never to have existed but yet he recognized the rights of property which had grown out of it
and would respect those rights as fully as similar rights in any other property that property can exist and does legally exist
he thought such a law wrong
but the rights of property resulting must be respected he would get rid of the odious law
not by violating the rights
but by encouraging the proposition and offering inducements to give it up
here the interview
so far as this subject is concerned
terminated by mr
crittenden's assuring the president that
whatever might be our final action
we all thought him solely moved by a high patriotism and sincere devotion to the happiness and glory of his country and with that conviction we should consider respectfully the important suggestions he had made
after some conversation on the current war news
we retired
and i immediately proceeded to my room and wrote out this paper
we were present at the interview described in the foregoing paper of mr
and we certify that the substance of what passed on the occasion is in this paper faithfully and fully given

it displays a perfection of workmanship which i really wish i had time to acknowledge in more fitting words
and i might then follow your idea that it is suggestive
for it is evidently expected that a good deal of whipping is to be done
but as we meet here socially let us not think only of whipping rebels
or of those who seem to think only of whipping negroes
but of those pleasant days
which it is to be hoped are in store for us
when seated behind a good pair of horses we can crack our whips and drive through a peaceful

president to general g
april 9
1862 major general mcclellan
my dear sir your despatches
complaining that you are not properly sustained
while they do not offend me
do pain me very much
blenker's division was withdrawn from you before you left here
and you knew the pressure under which i did it
as i thought
acquiesced in it certainly not without reluctance
after you left i ascertained that less than 20
000 unorganized men
without a single field battery
were all you designed to be left for the defense of washington and manassas junction
and part of this even to go to general hooker's old position general banks's corps
once designed for manassas junction
was divided and tied up on the line of winchester and strasburg
and could not leave it without again exposing the upper potomac and the baltimore and ohio railroad
this presented or would present when mcdowell and sumner should be gone a great temptation to the enemy to turn back from the rappahannock and sack washington
my explicit order that washington should
by the judgment of all the commanders of corps
be left entirely secure
had been neglected
it was precisely this that drove me to detain mcdowell
i do not forget that i was satisfied with your arrangement to leave banks at manassas junction but when that arrangement was broken up and nothing substituted for it
of course i was not satisfied
i was constrained to substitute something for it myself
and now allow me to ask
do you really think i should permit the line from richmond via manaasas junction to this city to be entirely open
except what resistance could be presented by less than 20
000 unorganized troops
this is a question which the country will not allow me to evade
there is a curious mystery about the number of the troops now with you
when i telegraphed you on the 6th
saying you had over 100
000 with you
i had just obtained from the secretary of war a statement
taken as he said from your own returns
making 108
000 then with you and en route to you
you now say you will have but 85
000 when all enroute to you shall have reached you
how can this discrepancy of 23
000 be accounted for
as to general wool's command
i understand it is doing for you precisely what a like number of your own would have to do if that command was away
i suppose the whole force which has gone forward to you is with you by this time and if so
i think it is the precise time for you to strike a blow
by delay the enemy will relatively gain upon you that is
he will gain faster by fortifications and reinforcements than you can by reinforcements alone
and once more let me tell you it is indispensable to you that you strike a blow
i am powerless to help this
you will do me the justice to remember i always insisted that going down the bay in search of a field
instead of fighting at or near manassas
was only shifting and not surmounting a difficulty that we would find the same enemy and the same or equal entrenchments at either place
the country will not fail to note is noting now that the present hesitation to move upon an entrenched enemy is but the story of manassas repeated
i beg to assure you that i have never written you or spoken to you in greater kindness of feeling than now
nor with a fuller purpose to sustain you
so far as in my most anxious judgment i consistently can but you must act
yours very truly

april 10
by the president of the united states of america
a proclamation it has pleased almighty god to vouchsafe signal victories to the land and naval forces engaged in suppressing

and at the same time to avert from our country the dangers of foreign intervention and invasion
it is therefore recommended to the people of the united states that at their next weekly assemblages in their accustomed places of public worship which shall occur after notice of this proclamation shall have been received
they especially acknowledge and render thanks to our heavenly father for these inestimable blessings
that they then and there implore spiritual consolation in behalf of all who have been brought into affliction by the casualties and calamities of sedition and civil war
and that they reverently invoke the divine guidance for our national counsels
to the end that they may speedily result in the restoration of peace
and unity throughout our borders and hasten the establishment of fraternal relations among all the countries of the earth

abolishing slavery in washington
message to congress
april 16
fellow citizens of the senate and house of representatives
the act entitled an act for the relief of certain persons held to service or labor in the district of columbia has this day been approved and signed
i have never doubted the constitutional authority of congress to abolish slavery in this district
and i have ever desired to see the national capital freed from the institution in some satisfactory way
hence there has never been in my mind any question on the subject except the one of expediency
arising in view of all the circumstances
if there be matters within and about this act which might have taken a course or shape more satisfactory to my judgment
i do not attempt to specify them
i am gratified that the two principles of compensation and colonization are both recognized and practically applied in the act
in the matter of compensation
it is provided that claims may be presented within ninety days from the passage of the act
but not thereafter and there is no saving for minors
femmes covert
insane or absent persons
i presume this is an omission by mere oversight
and i recommend that it be supplied by an amendatory or supplemental act

he has not been tried because
in the state of military operations at the time of his arrest and since
the officers to constitute a court martial and for witnesses could not be withdrawn from duty without serious injury to the service
he will be allowed a trial without any unnecessary delay the charges and specifications will be furnished him in due season

and loyal class of my fellow citizens in an important crisis which involves
in my judgment
not only the civil and religious liberties of our own dear land
but in a large degree the civil and religious liberties of mankind in many countries and through many ages
you well know
and the world knows
how reluctantly i accepted this issue of battle forced upon me on my advent to this place by the internal enemies of our country
you all know
the world knows
the forces and the resources the public agents have brought into employment to sustain a government against which there has been brought not one complaint of real injury committed against society at home or abroad
you all may recollect that in taking up the sword thus forced into our hands this government appealed to the prayers of the pious and the good
and declared that it placed its whole dependence on the favor of god
i now humbly and reverently
in your presence
reiterate the acknowledgment of that dependence
not doubting that
if it shall please the divine being who determines the destinies of nations
this shall remain a united people
and that they will
humbly seeking the divine guidance
make their prolonged national existence a source of new benefits to themselves and their successors
and to all classes and conditions of mankind

my dear sir
i have just assisted the secretary of war in framing part of a despatch to you relating to army corps
which despatch
of course
will have reached you long before this will
i wish to say a few words to you privately on this subject
i ordered the army corps organization not only on the unanimous opinion of the twelve generals whom you had selected and assigned as generals of divisions
but also on the unanimous opinion of every military man i could get an opinion from
and every modern military book
yourself only excepted
of course
i did not on my own judgment pretend to understand the subject
i now think it indispensable for you to know how your struggle against it is received in quarters which we cannot entirely disregard
it is looked upon as merely an effort to pamper one or two pets
and to persecute and degrade their supposed rivals
i have had no word from sumner
or keyes the commanders of these corps are
of course
the three highest officers with you but i am constantly told that you have no consultation or communication with them that you consult and communicate with nobody but general fitz john porter
and perhaps general franklin
i do not say these complaints are true or just but at all events
it is proper you should know of their existence
do the commanders of corps disobey your orders in anything
when you relieved general hamilton of his command the other day
you thereby lost the confidence of at least one of your best friends in the senate
and here let me say
not as applicable to you personally
that senators and representatives speak of me in their places without question
and that officers of the army must cease addressing insulting letters to them for taking no greater liberty with them
but to return
are you strong enough are you strong enough even with my help to set your foot upon the necks of sumner
and keyes all at once
this is a practical and very serious question to you
the success of your army and the cause of the country are the same
of course
i only desire the good of the cause

delivered in bloomington
in 1856
henry c
whitney undertook to reconstruct it from notes and memory
with a result which has been approved by some who heard it
while others
including a considerable group who gathered in bloomington to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of its original delivery and of the event which called it forth
declared their conviction that abraham lincoln's 'lost speech' is still lost
so far as i am aware no one now living remembers to have heard lincoln's address on the death of president zachary taylor
lincoln's oration on the death of henry clay is well known
and his speech commemorative of his friend
benjamin ferguson
also is of record
his eulogy on president zachary taylor
appears to have been wholly overlooked by lincoln's biographers and by the compilers of various editions of his works
nicolay and hay make no allusion to it
either in their life of lincoln or in their painstaking compilations of his writings and speeches
i have found but one reference to it
that in whitney's life on the circuit with lincoln
lovers of lincoln are to be congratulated upon this discovery
of which some account is to be given in this introduction
the address was delivered in the city hall in chicago on thursday afternoon
july 25
it was printed in one chicago paper
it was set up from lincoln's original manuscript
furnished for the purpose
president taylor died at washington on july 9
the disease was diagnosed as cholera morbus
a number of other distinguished men were sick in washington at the same time and apparently with the same disease
the death of taylor was a hard blow to the whig party
of its seven candidates for the presidency
it succeeded in electing only two
william henry harrison and zachary taylor
and each of these died not long after his election
lincoln arrived in chicago two days before the president's death
the chicago journal of monday evening
july 8
of springfield
arrived in town yesterday to attend to duties in the united states district court
now in session in this city
a meeting was held in chicago on the night of the president's death
july 9
and arrangements were made for a memorial service
in accordance with the journalistic methods of the times
the daily papers reported the proceedings entire
the committee appointed evidently acted promptly
for the same issue records that the committee had selected lincoln as the eulogist
and that he had accepted
the formal acceptance
was not published until two weeks later
and just before the address itself was delivered
the occasion for the delay would appear to have been that the common council of the city of chicago had started independently a movement for a memorial service
and that the two committees after some conference had agreed to combine in one service to be held in the city hall
the following correspondence was published on wednesday evening
july 24
eulogy upon the late president the following is a copy of the correspondence between the hon
lincoln and the committee of arrangements
for paying a suitable tribute of respect to the late president of the united states
the undersigned committee
appointed at a meeting of our fellow citizens

selected yourself for the purpose named and desire that you will be kind enough to accept thereof and to name the time when you will perform that duty

kercheval r
hamilton as was fitting
the committee turned over the manuscript to the journal
a whig paper
and the journal undertook to furnish the address to its readers on saturday
july 27
it found itself under the necessity however
of printing only part of the address in that issue
and apologized with a statement that postponement of the remainder was due to illness among its workmen
on monday the address was printed complete
the type used in the saturday issue remained standing and the remainder of the eulogy was set up
and joined to it
my attention was called to this report by hon
edward w
of barry
who having undertaken to discover in the chicago historical society another matter relating to lincoln
in which we were both interested
found this address and reported it to me
with an inquiry whether i had knowledge of it
i made search of the daily papers of the period and found not only the address
but the correspondence and notable items as here given
lincoln must have been glad of this opportunity to speak out of his heart his words of sincere admiration for a man whom he had helped to elect president of the united states
from the outset lincoln had believed in taylor
while many other whigs refused to support
or supported with languid interest
a candidate who was a slave holder and who had borne a conspicuous part in the mexican war
taylor was nominated by a whig convention
which met in philadelphia
june 7
the party was so divided that it could not put forth a distinctive platform
even an attempt to unite upon an expression concerning the wilmot proviso was regarded as so divisive that it was not permitted to come to a vote
the real platform was general taylor
and his popular nickname
old rough and ready
although taylor was no politician and a stranger even to the ballot box
he regarded himself as a whig
but he took pains to explain that he was not an ultra whig
daniel webster called him an ignorant old frontier colonel
but not only webster
but clay and seward
joined in his support
many a whig who voted for taylor accepted him as the choice of two evils
was enthusiastic in his support of the nominee
he went into the campaign
as nicolay and hay remind us
with exultant alacrity
they say
he could not even wait for the adjournment of congress to begin his stump speaking
following the bad example of the rest of his colleagues
he obtained the floor on the 27th of july and made a long
brilliant and humorous speech
upon the merits of the two candidates before the people
abraham lincoln
a history
this was lincoln's noted coat tail speech
in which he paid his respects to general cass
the candidate of the democrats
immediately after the adjournment of congress
lincoln went to new england
where he delivered speeches in favor of taylor
and opposing not so much the democrats as the free soilers
whose hostility was weakening and threatening to defeat the whig party
lincoln fully expected that taylor when elected would remember and reward him for this service
what lincoln wanted
inasmuch as he was not permitted to return to congress
was an appointment as general commissioner of the united states land office in washington
to his bitter disappointment taylor did not appoint him
but gave the position to justin butterfield
of chicago
who was said to have been favored by daniel webster
although lincoln's chief activity in the taylor campaign was outside the state of illinois
it happened that he delivered one notable stump speech for taylor in the city of chicago
it was while he was on his way back from the east
coming in part by the great lakes
and making his visit to niagara
that he stopped in chicago
october 6
the evening journal announced that hon
from this state
and family
were at the sherman house
the same issue called upon the friends of taylor and fillmore to rally that evening at the court house and hear mr
lincoln on the issues of the campaign
the notice is short
said the journal
but old zack's soldiers are all minute men
the papers next day announced that although there was scant notice
only six hours
the court house was overcrowded
and adjournment had to be taken to the park
where lincoln spoke for two hours in what the editor declared was one of the best political speeches which the editor had ever heard or read
when general taylor died
it was eminently fitting that lincoln
as the one whig member from illinois of the last congress before the election of taylor
should have been invited to deliver the eulogy upon him
his arrival in chicago
two days before the death of president taylor
furnished a convenient opportunity for the people of the city to hear him
if lincoln had any feelings
as he may well have had
that general taylor did not sufficiently recognize lincoln's activities in the campaign that led to his election
the address portrays nothing of his disappointment
though the address was hastily prepared in the midst of duties which kept him more or less busy in court
he accepted the invitation gladly and improved the occasion to the satisfaction of his hearers
in a number of respects the address of lincoln presents points of interest
first of all
it is notable in its biographical character
it presents in outline a fairly complete account of the life and service of general taylor
lincoln doubtless availed himself of such biographical data as the campaign had recently produced and which lincoln found at hand in chicago after the invitation had been received by him to deliver the address
it is noteworthy that in speaking of taylor's invasion of mexican territory
lincoln takes pains to state that he did it under orders
it was this fact that enabled lincoln and other whigs who were opposed on principle to the mexican war to support taylor for the presidency
they were particular to explain that he performed that act as a soldier
under orders
and that the polk administration was responsible
and not their own candidate
in this address lincoln did not enlarge upon that fact
but he did not fail to state it
his favorable comment upon the fact that taylor had not engaged in dueling is the more notable because lincoln had himself been an unwilling participant in what had threatened to be a duel a fact of which he was never very proud
it is notable that he speaks of taylor's freedom from ambition to be president until the position came within the range of possibility
and then became possessed of a laudable ambition to secure the position
lincoln had not as yet precisely an ambition of that character
but there always lurked in his mind the possibility that he might rise to that high position
even in 1848
when he had not been re lected to congress
and had been disappointed in his remaining political ambition
he still thought the desire to become president a laudable ambition
we note in the oration one or two studied attempts at eloquence
such as characterized the earlier oratory of lincoln
but which disappeared wholly from his later and more chaste style
the description of the mutual solicitude of the garrison of fort brown and the party of soldiers outside the fort
and of the relief that was succeeded by a cry of victory
must have been dramatic
and it shows at its best that earlier vein of abraham lincoln's studied attempt at oratorical effect
one of the most interesting because most characteristic qualities of the address is the appreciation of the magnanimity of general taylor
as exemplified in his treatment of colonel worth
this i regard as one of the best things in the address
because it was an example of what was best in that bluff and sensible and generous old soldier
zachary taylor
and because it was so nobly characteristic also of abraham lincoln
lincoln emphasized that quality in taylor
because he unconsciously sought out in him what was most truly like to his own noble nature
orations by one president upon another are none too common in american literature and this by lincoln upon taylor is of value in its estimate of the best in taylor as discerned by one in whom the same quality was worthily present
lincoln would have done for worth what taylor did
he treated in similar fashion the men who opposed him
one feature of the oration has remarkable interest
it appears to have been the only address of lincoln's in which he made use of his favorite poem
oh
why should the spirit of mortal be proud
this poem he quoted so often to his friends that some of them supposed him to have been its author
but so far as a search of his published works can show
he did not use it in any other formal address
lincoln often inquired of his friends whether any of them knew the author of this poem
so far as is known
he never learned
in his lecture which has served as the basis of all the literature concerning lincoln and ann rutledge
informs us that
after the death of ann
lincoln formed an attachment for this poem
it has been affirmed that he learned it from ann
i have inquired of mrs
sarah rutledge saunders
surviving 1 sister of ann rutledge
whether her mother knew this poem and taught it to her daughters
ann included
she replied
mother knew the poem
why should the spirit of mortal be proud
but she did not teach it to lincoln
the girls and mother learned it from lincoln
they always called it lincoln's song
footnote 1
saunders was living when this introduction was written
but died may 1
the first allusion made to this poem in any of lincoln's letters
that i have seen
was in april
when he was writing some verses of his own
and comparing them with those of another budding poet
william johnson
johnson had sent to lincoln a poem which he had written
a parody upon poe's raven
lincoln had never read the raven
but he sent to johnson some lines of his own
composed after his visit to his old home in indiana in the fall of 1844
in september
lincoln sent him additional lines suggested by the same visit
it is in the letter of april 18
that lincoln refers to the poem
oh why should the spirit of mortal be proud
he says
i have not your letter now before me but from memory
i think you ask me who is the author of the piece i sent you
and that you do so ask as to indicate a slight suspicion that i am the author
beyond all question
i am not the author
i would give all i am worth
and go in debt
to be able to write so fine a piece as i think that is
i met it in a straggling newspaper last summer
and i remember to have seen it once before
about fifteen years ago
and this is all i know about it
the statement that he first had seen the poem about fifteen years before 1846 that is
about 1831 carries his acquaintance with it back to the period of his friendship for ann rutledge
and it is not at all improbable that she learned it at the same time
after lincoln had become president
he is said to have made one or more copies of this poem for personal friends but i have not seen any of these copies
it would be interesting to know whether he ever knew the whole poem
literary critics have not shared his high estimate of the composition
in general they have esteemed it a rather mediocre piece
but its rhythm is accurate
and its rhyme is good
and its plaintive sentiment accorded with the melancholy of lincoln and of his social environment
it is not the only poem of no great literary merit which became popular in that period and it would have been forgotten with the rest but for the association of its lines with the name of abraham lincoln
he gave to it and its author their chief claim to immortality
during his presidency
lincoln said
there is a poem which has been a great favorite with me for years
which was first shown me when a young man
by a friend
and which i afterwards saw and cut from a newspaper and learned by heart
i would give a good deal to know who wrote it
but i have never been able to ascertain
the author of the poem
why should the spirit of mortal be proud
was william knox
who was born at firth
in the parish of lilliesleaf
in the county of roxburghshire
in scotland
on the 17th of august
and who died at the age of thirty six
from his early childhood he wrote verses
and he attained sufficient prominence to win the attention of walter scott
who encouraged him and loaned him money
what he might have done had he lived
we do not know but this is the only poem of his that has any claim to distinction
and that not for its own outstanding merit
but for its association with abraham lincoln
knox's earliest volume
the harp of zion
was published in 1825
and does not contain this poem
what appears to have been an inclusive volume of the poems of knox was published in london and edinburgh in 1847
and bore the title the lonely hearth
the songs of israel
harp of zion
and other poems
this includes the poem which bears the title mortality
it is interesting to recall that it has sometimes been printed with the title immortality
to that title
it can bear no claim
it will be of interest to compare the poem in its entirety with the stanzas which lincoln quoted on the occasion of his oration in memory of the deceased president
general zachary taylor
mortality by william knox oh
why should the spirit of mortal be proud
like a swift flying meteor
a fast flying cloud
a flash of the lightning
a break of the wave
man passeth from life to his rest in the grave
the leaves of the oak and the willow shall fade
be scattered around and together be laid and the young and the old
and the low and the high
shall moulder to dust and together shall lie
the infant a mother attended and loved the mother that infant's affection who proved the husband that mother and infant who blessed
are away to their dwellings of rest
the maid on whose cheek
on whose brow
in whose eye
shone beauty and pleasure
her triumphs are by and the memory of those who loved her and praised
are alike from the minds of the living erased
the hand of the king that the sceptre hath borne the brow of the priest that the mitre hath worn the eye of the sage and the heart of the brave
are hidden and lost in the depth of the grave
the peasant whose lot was to saw and to reap the herdsman who climbed with his goats up the steep the beggar who wandered in search of his bread
have faded away like the grass that we tread
the saint who enjoyed the communion of heaven the sinner who dared to remain unforgiven the wise and the foolish
the guilty and just
have quietly mingled their bones in the dust
so the multitude goes
like the flower or the weed
that withers away to let others succeed so the multitude comes
even those we behold
to repeat every tale that has often been told
for we are the same our fathers have been we see the same sights our fathers have seen
we drink the same stream and view the same sun
and run the same course our fathers have run
the thoughts we are thinking our fathers would think from the death we are shrinking our fathers would shrink to the life we are clinging our fathers would cling but it speeds for us all
like a bird on the wing
they loved
but the story we cannot unfold they scorned
but the heart of the haughty is cold they grieved
but no wail from their slumbers will come they joyed
but the tongue of their gladness is dumb
they died
they died
and we things that are now
who walk on the turf that lies over their brow
who make in their dwelling a transient abode
meet the things that they met on their pilgrimage road
hope and despondency
pleasure and pain
we mingle together in sunshine and rain and the smiles and the tears
the song and the dirge
still follow each other
like surge upon surge
tis the wink of an eye
tis the draught of a breath
from the blossom of health to the paleness of death
from the gilded saloon to the bier and the shroud
oh
why should the spirit of mortal be proud
the life and public service of general zachary taylor eulogy pronounced by hon
abraham lincoln on the life and services of the late president of the united states general zachary taylor
the eleventh elected president of the united states
is dead
he was born
november 2
in orange county
virginia and died july 9
in the sixty sixth year of his age
at the white house in washington city
he was the second son of richard taylor
a colonel in the army of the revolution
his youth was passed among the pioneers of kentucky
whither his parents emigrated soon after his birth and where his taste for military life
probably inherited
was greatly stimulated
near the commencement of our last war with great britain
he was appointed
by president jefferson
a lieutenant in the seventh regiment of infantry
during the war
he served under general harrison in his north western campaign against the indians and
having been promoted to a captaincy
was entrusted with the defense of fort harrison
with fifty men
half of them unfit for duty
a strong party of indians
under the prophet
brother of tecumseh
made a midnight attack upon the fort but taylor
though weak in his force
and without preparation
was resolute and on the alert and after a battle
which lasted till after daylight
completely repulsed them
soon after
he took a prominent part in the expedition under major general hopkins against the prophet's town and on his return
found a letter from president madison
who had succeeded mr
conferring on him a major's brevet for his gallant defense of fort harrison
after the close of the british war
he remained in the frontier service of the west
till 1818
he was then transferred to the southern frontier
where he remained
most of the time
in active service till 1826
in 1819
and during his service in the south
he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel
in 1826 he was again sent to the north west
where he continued until 1836
in 1832 he was promoted to the rank of colonel
in 1836 he was ordered to the south to engage in what is well known as the florida war
in the autumn of 1837 he fought and conquered in the memorable battle of okeechobee
one of the most desperate struggles known to the annals of indian warfare
for this he was honored with the rank of brigadier general and in 1838 was appointed to succeed general jessup in command of the forces in florida
in 1841 he was ordered to fort gibson to take command of the second military department of the united states and in september
was directed to hold the troops between the red river and the sabine in readiness to march as might be indicated by the charge of the united states
near texas
in 1845 his forces were concentrated at corpus christi
in obedience to orders
in march
he planted his troops on the rio grande opposite matamoros
soon after this
and near this place
a small detachment of general taylor's forces
under captain thornton
was cut to pieces by a party of mexicans
open hostilities being thus commenced
and general taylor being constantly menaced by mexican forces vastly superior to his own in numbers
his position became exceedingly critical
having erected a fort
he might defend himself against great odds while he could remain within it but his provisions had failed
and there was no supply nearer than point isabel
between which and the new fort the country was open to
and full of
armed mexicans
his resolution was at once taken
he garrisoned fort brown the new fort with a force of about four hundred and
putting himself at the head of the main body of his troops
marched forthwith for point isabel
he met no resistance on his march
having obtained his supplies
he began his return march
to the relief of fort brown
which he at first knew would be
and then knew had been
besieged by the enemy
immediately upon his leaving it
on the first or second day of his return march
the mexican general
met general taylor in front
and offered battle
the mexicans numbered six or eight thousand
opposed to whom were about two thousand americans
the moment was a trying one
taylor's forces were but a handful and few
of either officers or men
had ever been under fire
a brief council was held and the result was the battle commenced
the issue of that contest all remember remember with mingled sensations of pride and sorrow
that then american valor and powers triumphed
and then the gallant and accomplished and noble ringgold fell
the americans passed the night on the field
the general knew the enemy was still in his front and the question rose upon him
whether to advance or retreat
a council was again held and it is said
the general overruled the majority
and resolved to advance
in the morning
he moved rapidly forward
at about four or five miles from fort brown he again met the enemy in force
who had selected his position
and made some hasty fortifications
again the battle commenced
and raged till nightfall
when the mexicans were entirely routed
and the general
with his fatigued and bleeding and reduced battalions
marched into fort brown
there was a joyous meeting
a brief hour before
whether all within had perished
all without feared
but none could tell while the incessant roar of artillery wrought those within to the highest pitch of apprehension
that their brethren without were being massacred to the last man
and now the din of battle nears the fort
and sweeps obliquely by
a gleam of hope flies through the half imprisoned few they fly to the wall every eye is strained it is it is the stars and stripes are still aloft
anon the anxious brethren meet and while hand strikes hand
the heavens are rent with a loud
gushing cry of victory
soon after these battles
general taylor was brevetted a major general in the united states army
in the meantime
war having been declared to exist between the united states and mexico
provision was made to reinforce general taylor and he was ordered to march into the interior of mexico
he next marched upon monterey
arriving there on the nineteenth of september
he commenced an assault upon the city
on the twenty first and on the twenty third
was about carrying it at the point of the bayonet
when general ampudia capitulated
taylor's forces consisted of four hundred and twenty five officers
and nine thousand two hundred and twenty men
his artillery consisted of one ten inch mortar
two twenty four pound howitzers
and eight field batteries of four guns
the mortar being the only piece serviceable for the siege
the mexican works were armed with forty two pieces of cannon
and manned with a force of at least seven thousand troops of the line
and from two to three thousand irregulars
next we find him advancing farther into the interior of mexico
at the head of five thousand four hundred men
not more than six hundred being regular troops
at agua nueva
he received intelligence that santa anna
the greatest military chieftain of mexico
was advancing after him and he fell back to buena vista
a strong position a few miles in advance of saltillo
on the twenty second of february
the battle
now called the battle of buena vista
was commenced by santa anna at the head of twenty thousand well appointed soldiers
this was general taylor's great battle
the particulars of it are familiar to all
it continued through the twenty third and although general taylor's defeat seemed inevitable
yet he succeeded by skill
and by the courage and devotion of his officers and men
in repulsing the overwhelming forces of the enemy
and throwing them back into the desert
this was the battle of the chiefest interest fought during the mexican war
at the time it was fought
and for some weeks after
general taylor's communication with the united states was cut off and the road was in possession of parties of the enemy
for many days after full intelligence of it should have been in all parts of this country
nothing certain concerning it was known
while vague and painful rumors were afloat
that a great battle had been fought
and that general taylor and his whole force had been annihilated
at length the truth came
with its thrilling details of victory and blood
of glory and grief
a bright and glowing page was added to our nation's history but then
in eternal silence
lay clay and mckee and yell and lincoln
and our own beloved hardin
this was also general taylor's last battle
he remained in active service in mexico till the autumn of the same year
when he returned to the united states
passing in review general taylor's military history
some striking peculiarities will appear
no one of the six battles which he fought
that of monterey
presented a field which would have been selected by an ambitious captain upon which to gather laurels
so far as fame is concerned
the prospect the promise in advance was
you may lose
but you cannot win
yet taylor
in his blunt
business like view of things
seems never to have thought of this
it did not happen to general taylor
once in his life
to fight a battle on equal terms
or on terms advantageous to himself and yet he was never beaten
and he never retreated
in all
the odds were greatly against him in each
defeat seemed inevitable and yet in all he triumphed
wherever he has led
while the battle still raged
the issue was painfully doubtful yet in each and all
when the din had ceased
and the smoke had blown away
our country's flag was still seen
fluttering in the breeze
general taylor's battles were not distinguished for brilliant military maneuvers but in all he seems rather to have conquered by the exercise of a sober and steady judgment
coupled with a dogged incapacity to understand that defeat was possible
his rarest military trait was a combination of negatives absence of excitement and absence of fear
he could not be flurried
and he could not be scared
in connection with general taylor's military character may be mentioned his relations with his brother officers
and his soldiers
terrible as he was to his country's enemies
no man was so little disposed to have difficulty with his friends
during the period of his life
dueling was a practice not quite uncommon among gentlemen in the peaceful avocations of life
and still more common among the officers of the army and navy
so far as i can learn
a duel with general taylor has never been talked of
he was alike averse to sudden and to startling quarrels and he pursued no man with revenge
a notable and a noble instance of this is found in his conduct to the gallant and now lamented general worth
a short while before the battles of the eighth and ninth of may
some question of precedence arose between worth then a colonel and some other officer
which question it seems it was general taylor's duty to decide
he decided against worth
worth was greatly offended
left the army
came to the united states
and tendered his resignation to the authorities at washington
it is said
that in his passionate feeling
he hesitated not to speak harshly and disparagingly of general taylor
he was an officer of the highest character and his word
on military subjects
and about military men
could not
with the country
pass for nothing
in this absence from the army of colonel worth
the unexpected turn of things brought in the battles of the eighth and ninth
he was deeply mortified in almost absolute desperation at having lost the opportunity of being present
and taking part in those battles
the laurels won by his previous service
in his own eyes
seemed withering away
the government
both wisely and generously
i think
declined accepting his resignation and he returned to general taylor
then came general taylor's opportunity for revenge
the battle of monterey was approaching and even at hand
taylor could
if he would
so place worth in that battle
that his name would scarcely be noticed in the report
but no
he felt it was due to the service to assign the real post of honor to some one of the best officers he knew worth was one of the best
and he felt that it was generous to allow him
then and there
to retrieve his secret loss
he assigned to colonel worth in that assault
what was par excellence the post of honor and the duties of which he executed so well and so brilliantly as to eclipse
in that battle
even general taylor
as to general taylor's relations with his soldiers
details would be endless
it is perhaps enough to say and it is far from the least of his honors that we can truly say that of the many who served with him
through the long course of forty years
all testify to the uniform kindness
and his constant care for
and hearty sympathy with
their every want and every suffering while none can be found to declare that he was ever a tyrant anywhere
in anything
going back a little in point of time
it is proper to say that so soon as the news of the battles of the eighth and ninth of may
had fairly reached the united states
general taylor began to be named for the next presidency
by letter writers
public meetings and conventions in various parts of the country
these nominations were generally put forth as being of no party character
up to this time i think it highly probable nay
almost certain that general taylor had never thought of the presidency in connection with himself
and there is reason for believing that the first intelligence of these nominations rather amused than seriously interested him
yet i should be insincere
were i not to confess that
in my opinion
the repeated and steady manifestations in his favor did beget in his mind a laudable ambition to reach the high distinction of the presidential chair
as the time for the presidential canvass approached
it was seen that general nominations
combining anything near the number of votes necessary to an election
could not be made without some pretty strong and decided reference to party politics
in the month of may
the great democratic party nominated as their candidate an able and distinguished member of their own party general cass on strictly party grounds
almost immediately following this
the whig party
in general convention
nominated general taylor as their candidate
the election came off in the november following
and though there was also a third candidate
the two former only received any vote in the electoral college
general taylor
having the majority of them
was duly elected and he entered on the duties of that high and responsible office
march 5
the incidents of his administration
up to the time of his death
are too familiar and too fresh to require any direct repetition
the presidency
even to the most experienced politicians
is no bed of roses and general taylor
like others
found thorns within it
no human being can fill that station and escape censure
i hope and believe
when general taylor's official conduct shall come to be viewed in the calm light of history
he will be found to have deserved as little as any who have succeeded him
upon the death of general taylor
as it would be in the case of any president
we are naturally led to consider what will be its effect
upon the country
i will not pretend to believe that all the wisdom
or all of the patriotism of the country
died with general taylor
but we know that wisdom and patriotism
in a public office under institutions like ours
are wholly inefficient and worthless
unless they are sustained by the confidence and devotion of the people
and i confess my apprehensions
that in the death of the late president
we have lost a degree of that confidence and devotion which will not soon again pertain to any successor
between public measures regarded as antagonistic
there is often less real difference in their bearing on the public weal
than there is between the dispute being kept up or being settled either way
i fear the one great question of the day is not now so likely to be partially acquiesced in by the different sections of the union
as it would have been could general taylor have been spared to us
under all circumstances
trusting to our maker and through his wisdom and beneficence to the great body of our people
we will not despair
nor despond
in general taylor's general public relation to his country
what will strongly impress a close observer was his unostentatious
long enduring devotion to his duty
he indulged in no recreations
he visited no public places seeking applause but quietly
as the earth in its orbit
he was always at his post
along our whole indian frontier
through summer and winter
in sunshine and storm
like a sleepless sentinel
he has watched while we have slept for forty long years
how well might the dying hero say at last
i have done my duty
i am ready to go
nor can i help thinking that the american people
in electing general taylor to the presidency
thereby showing their high appreciation of his sterling
but inobtrusive qualities
did their country a service
and themselves an imperishable honor
it is much for the young to know that treading the hard path of duty as he trod it will be noticed
and will lead to high places
but he is gone
the conqueror at last is conquered
the fruits of his labor
his name
his memory and example
are all that is left us his example
verifying the great truth that he that humbleth himself
shall be exalted teaching that to serve one's country with a singleness of purpose gives assurances of that country's gratitude
secures its best honors
and makes a dying bed
soft as downy pillows are
the death of the last president may not be without its use
in reminding us that we
must die
abstractly considered
is the same with the high as with the low but practically we are not so much aroused by the contemplation of our own mortal natures
by the fall of many undistinguished
as that of one great and well known name
by the latter
we are forced to muse
and ponder sadly
why should the spirit of mortal be proud
so the multitude goes
like the flower or the weed
that withers away
to let others succeed so the multitude comes
even those we behold
to repeat every tale that has often been told
for we are same that our fathers have been we see the same sights our fathers have seen
we drink the same streams
and see the same sun
and run the same course our fathers have run
they loved
but the story we cannot unfold they scorned
but the heart of the haughty is cold they grieved
but no wail from their slumbers will come they rejoiced
but the tongue of their gladness is dumb
they died
they died
things that are now
that work on the turf that lies on their brow and make in their dwellings a transient abode
meet the things that they met on their pilgrimage road
hope and despondency
pleasure and pain are mingled together in sunshine and rain and the smile and the tear
and the song and the dirge still follow each other like surge upon surge
tis the wink of an eye
tis the draught of a breath
from the blossom of health
to the paleness of death from the gilded saloon
to the bier and the shroud
o why should the spirit of mortal be proud

dear speed
yours of the 9th instant is duly received
which i do not meet as a bore
but as a most welcome visitor
i will answer the business part of it first
in relation to our congress matter here
you were right in supposing i would support the nominee
neither baker nor i
is the man
but hardin
so far as i can judge from present appearances
we shall have no split or trouble about the matter all will be harmony
in relation to the coming events about which butler wrote you
i had not heard one word before i got your letter but i have so much confidence in the judgment of butler on such a subject that i incline to think there may be some reality in it
what day does butler appoint
by the way
how do events of the same sort come on in your family
are you possessing houses and lands
and oxen and asses
and men servants and maid servants
and begetting sons and daughters
we are not keeping house
but boarding at the globe tavern
which is very well kept now by a widow lady of the name of beck
our room the same that dr
wallace occupied there and boarding only costs us four dollars a week
ann todd was married something more than a year since to a fellow by the name of campbell
and who
mary says
is pretty much of a dunce
though he has a little money and property
they live in boonville
and have not been heard from lately enough for me to say anything about her health
i reckon it will scarcely be in our power to visit kentucky this year
besides poverty and the necessity of attending to business
those coming events
i suspect
would be somewhat in the way
i most heartily wish you and your fanny would not fail to come
just let us know the time
and we will have a room provided for you at our house
and all be merry together for a while
be sure to give my respects to your mother and family assure her that if ever i come near her
i will not fail to call and see her
mary joins in sending love to your fanny and you
yours as ever
1844 to gen
may 21
dear hardin
knowing that you have correspondents enough
i have forborne to trouble you heretofore and i now only do so to get you to set a matter right which has got wrong with one of our best friends
it is old uncle thomas campbell of spring creek berlin p
he has received several documents from you
and he says they are old newspapers and documents
having no sort of interest in them
he is
getting a strong impression that you treat him with disrespect
i know
is a mistaken impression and you must correct it
the way
i leave to yourself
rob't w
canfield says he would like to have a document or two from you
the locos democrats here are in considerable trouble about van buren's letter on texas
and the virginia electors
they are growing sick of the tariff question and consequently are much confounded at v
s cutting them off from the new texas question
nearly half the leaders swear they won't stand it
of those are ford
calhoun and others
they don't exactly say they won't vote for v
but they say he will not be the candidate
and that they are for texas anyhow
as ever yours
1845 selection of congressional candidates to gen
dear general
i do not wish to join in your proposal of a new plan for the selection of a whig candidate for congress because
i am entirely satisfied with the old system under which you and baker were successively nominated and elected to congress and because the whigs of the district are well acquainted with the system
so far as i know or believe
are well satisfied with it
if the old system be thought to be vague
as to all the delegates of the county voting the same way
or as to instructions to them as to whom they are to vote for
or as to filling vacancies
i am willing to join in a provision to make these matters certain
as to your proposals that a poll shall be opened in every precinct
and that the whole shall take place on the same day
i do not personally object
they seem to me to be not unfair and i forbear to join in proposing them only because i choose to leave the decision in each county to the whigs of the county
to be made as their own judgment and convenience may dictate
as to your proposed stipulation that all the candidates shall remain in their own counties
and restrain their friends in the same it seems to me that on reflection you will see the fact of your having been in congress has
in various ways
so spread your name in the district as to give you a decided advantage in such a stipulation
i appreciate your desire to keep down excitement and i promise you to keep cool under all circumstances
i have already said i am satisfied with the old system under which such good men have triumphed and that i desire no departure from its principles
but if there must be a departure from it
i shall insist upon a more accurate and just apportionment of delegates
or representative votes
to the constituent body
than exists by the old
and which you propose to retain in your new plan
if we take the entire population of the counties as shown by the late census
we shall see by the old plan
and by your proposed new plan
morgan county
with a population 16
has but
8 votes while sangamon with 18
697 2156 greater has but
8 so scott with 6553 has
4 while tazewell with 7615 1062 greater has but
4 so mason with 3135 has
1 vote while logan with 3907
772 greater
has but
1 and so on in a less degree the matter runs through all the counties
being not only wrong in principle
but the advantage of it being all manifestly in your favor with one slight exception
in the comparison of two counties not here mentioned
if we take the whig votes of the counties as shown by the late presidential election as a basis
the thing is still worse
it seems to me most obvious that the old system needs adjustment in nothing so much as in this and still
by your proposal
no notice is taken of it
i have always been in the habit of acceding to almost any proposal that a friend would make and i am truly sorry that i cannot in this
i perhaps ought to mention that some friends at different places are endeavoring to secure the honor of the sitting of the convention at their towns respectively
and i fear that they would not feel much complimented if we shall make a bargain that it should sit nowhere
yours as ever

friend williams
the supreme court adjourned this morning for the term
your cases of reinhardt vs
bunce vs
dickhut vs

hinman vs
pope i wrote you concerning some time ago
mcnutt et al
bean and thompson is reversed and remanded
fitzpatrick vs

is reversed and remanded with leave to complainant to amend his bill so as to show the real consideration given for the land
bunce against graves the court confirmed
in accordance with your directions
i moved to have the case remanded to enable you to take a new trial in the court below
the court allowed the motion of which i am glad
and i guess you are
i believe
is all as to court business
the canal men have got their measure through the legislature pretty much or quite in the shape they desired
nothing else now

abolition movement to williamson durley
october 3
1845 when i saw you at home
it was agreed that i should write to you and your brother madison
until i then saw you i was not aware of your being what is generally called an abolitionist
as you call yourself
a liberty man
though i well knew there were many such in your country
i was glad to hear that you intended to attempt to bring about
at the next election in putnam
a union of the whigs proper and such of the liberty men as are whigs in principle on all questions save only that of slavery
so far as i can perceive
by such union neither party need yield anything on the point in difference between them
if the whig abolitionists of new york had voted with us last fall
clay would now be president
whig principles in the ascendant
and texas not annexed whereas
by the division
all that either had at stake in the contest was lost
it was extremely probable
that such would be the result
as i always understood
the liberty men deprecated the annexation of texas extremely and this being so
why they should refuse to cast their votes so as to prevent it
even to me seemed wonderful
what was their process of reasoning
i can only judge from what a single one of them told me
it was this
we are not to do evil that good may come
this general proposition is doubtless correct but did it apply
if by your votes you could have prevented the extension
of slavery would it not have been good
and not evil
so to have used your votes
even though it involved the casting of them for a slaveholder
by the fruit the tree is to be known
an evil tree cannot bring forth good fruit
if the fruit of electing mr
clay would have been to prevent the extension of slavery
could the act of electing have been evil
but i will not argue further
i perhaps ought to say that individually i never was much interested in the texas question
i never could see much good to come of annexation
inasmuch as they were already a free republican people on our own model
on the other hand
i never could very clearly see how the annexation would augment the evil of slavery
it always seemed to me that slaves would be taken there in about equal numbers
with or without annexation
and if more were taken because of annexation
still there would be just so many the fewer left where they were taken from
it is possibly true
to some extent
with annexation
some slaves may be sent to texas and continued in slavery that otherwise might have been liberated
to whatever extent this may be true
i think annexation an evil
i hold it to be a paramount duty of us in the free states
due to the union of the states
and perhaps to liberty itself paradox though it may seem
to let the slavery of the other states alone while
on the other hand
i hold it to be equally clear that we should never knowingly lend ourselves
directly or indirectly
to prevent that slavery from dying a natural death to find new places for it to live in when it can no longer exist in the old
of course i am not now considering what would be our duty in cases of insurrection among the slaves
to recur to the texas question
i understand the liberty men to have viewed annexation as a much greater evil than ever i did and i would like to convince you
if i could
that they could have prevented it
if they had chosen
i intend this letter for you and madison together and if you and he or either shall think fit to drop me a line
i shall be pleased
yours with respect
1846 request for political support to dr
robert boal
january 7
robert boal
dear doctor
since i saw you last fall
i have often thought of writing to you
as it was then understood i would
on reflection
i have always found that i had nothing new to tell you
all has happened as i then told you i expected it would baker's declining
hardin's taking the track
and so on
if hardin and i stood precisely equal
if neither of us had been to congress
or if we both had
it would only accord with what i have always done
for the sake of peace
to give way to him and i expect i should do it
that i can voluntarily postpone my pretensions
when they are no more than equal to those to which they are postponed
you have yourself seen
but to yield to hardin under present circumstances seems to me as nothing else than yielding to one who would gladly sacrifice me altogether
this i would rather not submit to
that hardin is talented
usually generous and magnanimous
i have before this affirmed to you and do not deny
you know that my only argument is that turn about is fair play
this he
practically at least
if it would not be taxing you too much
i wish you would write me
telling the aspect of things in your country
or rather your district and also
send the names of some of your whig neighbors
to whom i might
with propriety
unless i can get some one to do this
with his old franking list
will have the advantage of me
my reliance for a fair shake and i want nothing more in your country is chiefly on you
because of your position and standing
and because i am acquainted with so few others
let me hear from you soon
yours truly
to john bennett
john bennett
friend john
nathan dresser is here
and speaks as though the contest between hardin and me is to be doubtful in menard county
i know he is candid and this alarms me some
i asked him to tell me the names of the men that were going strong for hardin
he said morris was about as strong as any now tell me
is morris going it openly
you remember you wrote me that he would be neutral
nathan also said that some man
whom he could not remember
had said lately that menard county was going to decide the contest and that made the contest very doubtful
do you know who that was
don't fail to write me instantly on receiving this
telling me all particularly the names of those who are going strong against me
yours as ever

dear sir
you perhaps know that general hardin and i have a contest for the whig nomination for congress for this district
he has had a turn and my argument is turn about is fair play
i shall be pleased if this strikes you as a sufficient argument
yours truly
to james berdan
april 26
dear sir
i thank you for the promptness with which you answered my letter from bloomington
i also thank you for the frankness with which you comment upon a certain part of my letter because that comment affords me an opportunity of trying to express myself better than i did before
as i do
that in that part of my letter
you have not understood me as i intended to be understood
in speaking of the dissatisfaction of men who yet mean to do no wrong
i mean no special application of what i said to the whigs of morgan
or of morgan scott
i only had in my mind the fact that previous to general hardin's withdrawal some of his friends and some of mine had become a little warm and i felt
and meant to say
that for them now to meet face to face and converse together was the best way to efface any remnant of unpleasant feeling
if any such existed
i did not suppose that general hardin's friends were in any greater need of having their feelings corrected than mine were
since i saw you at jacksonville
i have had no more suspicion of the whigs of morgan than of those of any other part of the district
i write this only to try to remove any impression that i distrust you and the other whigs of your country
yours truly
to james berdan

dear sir
it is a matter of high moral obligation
if not of necessity
for me to attend the coles and edwards courts
i have some cases in both of them
in which the parties have my promise
and are depending upon me
the court commences in coles on the second monday
and in edgar on the third
your court in morgan commences on the fourth monday and it is my purpose to be with you then
and make a speech
i mention the coles and edgar courts in order that if i should not reach jacksonville at the time named you may understand the reason why
i do not
think there is much danger of my being detained as i shall go with a purpose not to be
and consequently shall engage in no new cases that might delay me
yours truly
verses written by lincoln after a visit to his old home in indiana a fragment
in december
when lincoln was stumping for clay
he crossed into indiana and revisited his old home
he writes
that part of the country is within itself as unpoetical as any spot on earth but still seeing it and its objects and inhabitants aroused feelings in me which were certainly poetry though whether my expression of these feelings is poetry
is quite another question
near twenty years have passed away since here i bid farewell to woods and fields
and scenes of play
and playmates loved so well
where many were
but few remain of old familiar things but seeing them to mind again the lost and absent brings
the friends i left that parting day
how changed
as time has sped
young childhood grown
strong manhood gray
and half of all are dead
i hear the loved survivors tell how naught from death could save
till every sound appears a knell
and every spot a grave
i range the fields with pensive tread
and pace the hollow rooms
and feel companion of the dead i 'm living in the tombs
verses written by lincoln concerning a school fellow who became insane a fragment
and when at length the drear and long time soothed thy fiercer woes
how plaintively thy mournful song upon the still night rose i've heard it oft as if i dreamed
far distant
sweet and lone the funeral dirge it ever seemed of reason dead and gone
air held her breath trees with the spell seemed sorrowing angels round
whose swelling tears in dewdrops fell upon the listening ground
but this is past
and naught remains that raised thee o'er the brute thy piercing shrieks and soothing strains are like
forever mute
now fare thee well
more thou the cause than subject now of woe
all mental pangs by time's kind laws hast lost the power to know
o death
thou awe inspiring prince that keepst the world in fear
why dost thou tear more blest ones hence
and leave him lingering here

dear speed
no doubt
assign the suspension of our correspondence to the true philosophic cause though it must be confessed by both of us that this is rather a cold reason for allowing a friendship such as ours to die out by degrees
i propose now that
upon receipt of this
you shall be considered in my debt
and under obligations to pay soon
and that neither shall remain long in arrears hereafter
are you agreed
being elected to congress
though i am very grateful to our friends for having done it
has not pleased me as much as i expected
we have another boy
born the 10th of march
he is very much such a child as bob was at his age
rather of a longer order
bob is short and low
and i expect always will be
he talks very plainly
almost as plainly as anybody
he is quite smart enough
i sometimes fear that he is one of the little rare ripe sort that are smarter at about five than ever after
he has a great deal of that sort of mischief that is the offspring of such animal spirits
since i began this letter
a messenger came to tell me bob was lost but by the time i reached the house his mother had found him and had him whipped
and by now
very likely
he is run away again

your second letter on the matter of thornton and others
came to hand this morning
i went at once to see logan
and found that he is not engaged against you
and that he has so sent you word by mr
as he says
he says that some time ago
a young man who he knows not came to him
with a copy of the affidavit
to engage him to aid in getting the governor to grant the warrant and that he
told the man
that in his opinion
the affidavit was clearly insufficient
upon which the young man left
without making any engagement with him
if the governor shall arrive before i leave
logan and i will both attend to the matter
and he will attend to it
if he does not come till after i leave all upon the condition that the governor shall not have acted upon the matter
before his arrival here
i mention this condition because
i learned this morning from the secretary of state
that he is forwarding to the governor
at palestine
all papers he receives in the case
as fast as he receives them
among the papers forwarded will be your letter to the governor or secretary of
i believe
the same date and about the same contents of your last letter to me so that the governor will
at all events have your points and authorities
the case is a clear one on our side but whether the governor will view it so is another thing

dear william
you may remember that about a year ago a man by the name of wilson james wilson
i think paid us twenty dollars as an advance fee to attend to a case in the supreme court for him
against a mr
the record of which case was in the hands of mr
dixon of st
who never furnished it to us
when i was at bloomington last fall i met a friend of wilson
who mentioned the subject to me
and induced me to write to wilson
telling him i would leave the ten dollars with you which had been left with me to pay for making abstracts in the case
so that the case may go on this winter but i came away
and forgot to do it
what i want now is to send you the money
to be used accordingly
if any one comes on to start the case
or to be retained by you if no one does
there is nothing of consequence new here
congress is to organize to morrow
last night we held a whig caucus for the house
and nominated winthrop of massachusetts for speaker
sargent of pennsylvania for sergeant at arms
homer of new jersey door keeper
and mccormick of district of columbia postmaster
the whig majority in the house is so small that
together with some little dissatisfaction
it leaves it doubtful whether we will elect them all
this paper is too thick to fold
which is the reason i send only a half sheet

your letter
advising me of the receipt of our fee in the bank case
is just received
and i don't expect to hear another as good a piece of news from springfield while i am away
i am under no obligations to the bank and i therefore wish you to buy bank certificates
and pay my debt there
so as to pay it with the least money possible
i would as soon you should buy them of mr

as of any one else
provided you can get them as cheaply
i suppose
after the bank debt shall be paid
there will be some money left
out of which i would like to have you pay lavely and stout twenty dollars
and priest and somebody oil makers ten dollars
for materials got for house painting
if there shall still be any left
keep it till you see or hear from me
i shall begin sending documents so soon as i can get them

resolutions in the united states house of representatives
december 22
1847 whereas
the president of the united states
in his message of may 11
has declared that the mexican government not only refused to receive him the envoy of the united states
or to listen to his propositions
after a long continued series of menaces
has at last invaded our territory and shed the blood of our fellow citizens on our own soil and again
in his message of december 8
that we had ample cause of war against mexico long before the breaking out of hostilities but even then we forbore to take redress into our own hands until mexico herself became the aggressor
by invading our soil in hostile array
and shedding the blood of our citizens and yet again
in his message of december 7
that the mexican government refused even to hear the terms of adjustment which he our minister of peace was authorized to propose
and finally
under wholly unjustifiable pretexts
involved the two countries in war
by invading the territory of the state of texas
striking the first blow
and shedding the blood of our citizens on our own soil and whereas
this house is desirous to obtain a full knowledge of all the facts which go to establish whether the particular spot on which the blood of our citizens was so shed was or was not at that time our own soil
by the house of representatives
that the president of the united states be respectfully requested to inform this house
whether the spot on which the blood of our citizens was shed
as in his message declared
was or was not within the territory of spain
at least after the treaty of 1819
until the mexican revolution
whether that spot is or is not within the territory which was wrested from spain by the revolutionary government of mexico
whether that spot is or is not within a settlement of people
which settlement has existed ever since long before the texas revolution
and until its inhabitants fled before the approach of the united states army
whether that settlement is or is not isolated from any and all other settlements by the gulf and the rio grande on the south and west
and by wide uninhabited regions on the north and east
whether the people of that settlement
or a majority of them
or any of them
have ever submitted themselves to the government or laws of texas or of the united states
by consent or by compulsion
either by accepting office
or voting at elections
or paying tax
or serving on juries
or having process served upon them
or in any other way
whether the people of that settlement did or did not flee from the approach of the united states army
leaving unprotected their homes and their growing crops
before the blood was shed
as in the message stated and whether the first blood
so shed
was or was not shed within the inclosure of one of the people who had thus fled from it
whether our citizens
whose blood was shed
as in his message declared
were or were not
at that time
armed officers and soldiers
sent into that settlement by the military order of the president
through the secretary of war
whether the military force of the united states was or was not so sent into that settlement after general taylor had more than once intimated to the war department that
in his opinion
no such movement was necessary to the defence or protection of texas
remarks in the united states house of representatives
january 5
lincoln said he had made an effort
some few days since
to obtain the floor in relation to this measure resolution to direct postmaster general to make arrangements with railroad for carrying the mails in committee of the whole
but had failed
one of the objects he had then had in view was now in a great measure superseded by what had fallen from the gentleman from virginia who had just taken his seat
he begged to assure his friends on the other side of the house that no assault whatever was meant upon the postmaster general
and he was glad that what the gentleman had now said modified to a great extent the impression which might have been created by the language he had used on a previous occasion
he wanted to state to gentlemen who might have entertained such impressions
that the committee on the post office was composed of five whigs and four democrats
and their report was understood as sustaining
not impugning
the position taken by the postmaster general
that report had met with the approbation of all the whigs
and of all the democrats also
with the exception of one
and he wanted to go even further than this
intimation was informally given mr
lincoln that it was not in order to mention on the floor what had taken place in committee
he then observed that if he had been out of order in what he had said he took it all back so far as he could
he had no desire
he could assure gentlemen
ever to be out of order though he never could keep long in order
lincoln went on to observe that he differed in opinion
in the present case
from his honorable friend from richmond mr
that gentleman
had begun his remarks by saying that if all prepossessions in this matter could be removed out of the way
but little difficulty would be experienced in coming to an agreement
he could assure that gentleman that he had himself begun the examination of the subject with prepossessions all in his favor
he had long and often heard of him
from what he had heard
was prepossessed in his favor
of the postmaster general he had also heard
but had no prepossessions in his favor
though certainly none of an opposite kind
he differed
with that gentleman in politics
while in this respect he agreed with the gentleman from virginia mr
whom he wished to oblige whenever it was in his power
that gentleman had referred to the report made to the house by the postmaster general
and had intimated an apprehension that gentlemen would be disposed to rely
on that report alone
and derive their views of the case from that document alone
now it so happened that a pamphlet had been slipped into his mr
lincoln's hand before he read the report of the postmaster general so that
even in this
he had begun with prepossessions in favor of the gentleman from virginia
as to the report
he had but one remark to make
he had carefully examined it
and he did not understand that there was any dispute as to the facts therein stated the dispute
if he understood it
was confined altogether to the inferences to be drawn from those facts
it was a difference not about facts
but about conclusions
the facts were not disputed
if he was right in this
he supposed the house might assume the facts to be as they were stated
and thence proceed to draw their own conclusions
the gentleman had said that the postmaster general had got into a personal squabble with the railroad company
of this mr
lincoln knew nothing
nor did he need or desire to know anything
because it had nothing whatever to do with a just conclusion from the premises
but the gentleman had gone on to ask whether so great a grievance as the present detention of the southern mail ought not to be remedied
lincoln would assure the gentleman that if there was a proper way of doing it
no man was more anxious than he that it should be done
the report made by the committee had been intended to yield much for the sake of removing that grievance
that the grievance was very great there was no dispute in any quarter
he supposed that the statements made by the gentleman from virginia to show this were all entirely correct in point of fact
he did suppose that the interruptions of regular intercourse
and all the other inconveniences growing out of it
were all as that gentleman had stated them to be and certainly
if redress could be rendered
it was proper it should be rendered as soon as possible
the gentleman said that in order to effect this no new legislative action was needed all that was necessary was that the postmaster general should be required to do what the law
as it stood
authorized and required him to do
we come then
said mr
to the law
now the postmaster general says he cannot give to this company more than two hundred and thirty seven dollars and fifty cents per railroad mile of transportation
and twelve and a half per cent
less for transportation by steamboats
he considers himself as restricted by law to this amount and he says
that he would not give more if he could
because in his apprehension it would not be fair and just
1848 desire for second term in congress to william h
january 8
dear william
your letter of december 27 was received a day or two ago
i am much obliged to you for the trouble you have taken
and promise to take in my little business there
as to speech making
by way of getting the hang of the house i made a little speech two or three days ago on a post office question of no general interest
i find speaking here and elsewhere about the same thing
i was about as badly scared
and no worse as i am when i speak in court
i expect to make one within a week or two
in which i hope to succeed well enough to wish you to see it
it is very pleasant to learn from you that there are some who desire that i should be reelected
i most heartily thank them for their kind partiality and i can say
as mr
clay said of the annexation of texas
that personally i would not object to a reelection
although i thought at the time
and still think
it would be quite as well for me to return to the law at the end of a single term
i made the declaration that i would not be a candidate again
more from a wish to deal fairly with others
to keep peace among our friends
and to keep the district from going to the enemy
than for any cause personal to myself so that if it should so happen that nobody else wishes to be elected
i could not refuse the people the right of sending me again
but to enter myself as a competitor of others
or to authorize any one so to enter me is what my word and honor forbid
i got some letters intimating a probability of so much difficulty amongst our friends as to lose us the district but i remember such letters were written to baker when my own case was under consideration
and i trust there is no more ground for such apprehension now than there was then
remember i am always glad to receive a letter from you
most truly your friend
speech on declaration of war on mexico speech in the united states house of representatives
january 12
mr chairman
some if not all the gentlemen on the other side of the house who have addressed the committee within the last two days have spoken rather complainingly
if i have rightly understood them
of the vote given a week or ten days ago declaring that the war with mexico was unnecessarily and unconstitutionally commenced by the president
i admit that such a vote should not be given in mere party wantonness
and that the one given is justly censurable if it have no other or better foundation
i am one of those who joined in that vote and i did so under my best impression of the truth of the case
how i got this impression
and how it may possibly be remedied
i will now try to show
when the war began
it was my opinion that all those who because of knowing too little
or because of knowing too much
could not conscientiously approve the conduct of the president in the beginning of it should nevertheless
as good citizens and patriots
remain silent on that point
at least till the war should be ended
some leading democrats
including ex president van buren
have taken this same view
as i understand them and i adhered to it and acted upon it
until since i took my seat here and i think i should still adhere to it were it not that the president and his friends will not allow it to be so
besides the continual effort of the president to argue every silent vote given for supplies into an indorsement of the justice and wisdom of his conduct besides that singularly candid paragraph in his late message in which he tells us that congress with great unanimity had declared that by the act of the republic of mexico
a state of war exists between that government and the united states
when the same journals that informed him of this also informed him that when that declaration stood disconnected from the question of supplies sixty seven in the house
and not fourteen merely
voted against it besides this open attempt to prove by telling the truth what he could not prove by telling the whole truth demanding of all who will not submit to be misrepresented
in justice to themselves
to speak out
besides all this
one of my colleagues mr
richardson at a very early day in the session brought in a set of resolutions expressly indorsing the original justice of the war on the part of the president
upon these resolutions when they shall be put on their passage i shall be compelled to vote so that i cannot be silent if i would
seeing this
i went about preparing myself to give the vote understandingly when it should come
i carefully examined the president's message
to ascertain what he himself had said and proved upon the point
the result of this examination was to make the impression that
taking for true all the president states as facts
he falls far short of proving his justification and that the president would have gone further with his proof if it had not been for the small matter that the truth would not permit him
under the impression thus made i gave the vote before mentioned
i propose now to give concisely the process of the examination i made
and how i reached the conclusion i did
the president
in his first war message of may
declares that the soil was ours on which hostilities were commenced by mexico
and he repeats that declaration almost in the same language in each successive annual message
thus showing that he deems that point a highly essential one
in the importance of that point i entirely agree with the president
to my judgment it is the very point upon which he should be justified
or condemned
in his message of december
it seems to have occurred to him
as is certainly true
that title ownership to soil or anything else is not a simple fact
but is a conclusion following on one or more simple facts and that it was incumbent upon him to present the facts from which he concluded the soil was ours on which the first blood of the war was shed
a little below the middle of page twelve in the message last referred to
he enters upon that task forming an issue and introducing testimony
extending the whole to a little below the middle of page fourteen
i propose to try to show that the whole of this issue and evidence is from beginning to end the sheerest deception
the issue
as he presents it
is in these words
but there are those who
conceding all this to be true
assume the ground that the true western boundary of texas is the nueces
instead of the rio grande and that
in marching our army to the east bank of the latter river
we passed the texas line and invaded the territory of mexico
now this issue is made up of two affirmatives and no negative
the main deception of it is that it assumes as true that one river or the other is necessarily the boundary and cheats the superficial thinker entirely out of the idea that possibly the boundary is somewhere between the two
and not actually at either
a further deception is that it will let in evidence which a true issue would exclude
a true issue made by the president would be about as follows
i say the soil was ours
on which the first blood was shed there are those who say it was not
i now proceed to examine the president's evidence as applicable to such an issue
when that evidence is analyzed
it is all included in the following propositions
1 that the rio grande was the western boundary of louisiana as we purchased it of france in 1803
2 that the republic of texas always claimed the rio grande as her eastern boundary
3 that by various acts she had claimed it on paper
4 that santa anna in his treaty with texas recognized the rio grande as her boundary
5 that texas before
and the united states after
annexation had exercised jurisdiction beyond the nueces between the two rivers
6 that our congress understood the boundary of texas to extend beyond the nueces
now for each of these in its turn
his first item is that the rio grande was the western boundary of louisiana
as we purchased it of france in 1803 and seeming to expect this to be disputed
he argues over the amount of nearly a page to prove it true
at the end of which he lets us know that by the treaty of 1803 we sold to spain the whole country from the rio grande eastward to the sabine
admitting for the present that the rio grande was the boundary of louisiana
what under heaven had that to do with the present boundary between us and mexico
the line that once divided your land from mine can still be the boundary between us after i have sold my land to you is to me beyond all comprehension
and how any man
with an honest purpose only of proving the truth
could ever have thought of introducing such a fact to prove such an issue is equally incomprehensible
his next piece of evidence is that the republic of texas always claimed this river rio grande as her western boundary
that is not true
in fact
texas has claimed it
but she has not always claimed it
there is at least one distinguished exception
her state constitution the republic's most solemn and well considered act
that which may
without impropriety
be called her last will and testament
revoking all others makes no such claim
but suppose she had always claimed it
has not mexico always claimed the contrary
so that there is but claim against claim
leaving nothing proved until we get back of the claims and find which has the better foundation
though not in the order in which the president presents his evidence
i now consider that class of his statements which are in substance nothing more than that texas has
by various acts of her convention and congress
claimed the rio grande as her boundary
on paper
i mean here what he says about the fixing of the rio grande as her boundary in her old constitution not her state constitution
about forming congressional districts
now all of this is but naked claim and what i have already said about claims is strictly applicable to this
if i should claim your land by word of mouth
that certainly would not make it mine and if i were to claim it by a deed which i had made myself
and with which you had had nothing to do
the claim would be quite the same in substance or rather
in utter nothingness
i next consider the president's statement that santa anna in his treaty with texas recognized the rio grande as the western boundary of texas
besides the position so often taken
that santa anna while a prisoner of war
a captive
could not bind mexico by a treaty
which i deem conclusive besides this
i wish to say something in relation to this treaty
so called by the president
with santa anna
if any man would like to be amused by a sight of that little thing which the president calls by that big name
he can have it by turning to niles's register
and if any one should suppose that niles's register is a curious repository of so mighty a document as a solemn treaty between nations
i can only say that i learned to a tolerable degree of certainty
by inquiry at the state department
that the president himself never saw it anywhere else
by the way
i believe i should not err if i were to declare that during the first ten years of the existence of that document it was never by anybody called a treaty that it was never so called till the president
in his extremity
attempted by so calling it to wring something from it in justification of himself in connection with the mexican war
it has none of the distinguishing features of a treaty
it does not call itself a treaty
santa anna does not therein assume to bind mexico he assumes only to act as the president commander in chief of the mexican army and navy stipulates that the then present hostilities should cease
and that he would not himself take up arms
nor influence the mexican people to take up arms
against texas during the existence of the war of independence
he did not recognize the independence of texas he did not assume to put an end to the war
but clearly indicated his expectation of its continuance he did not say one word about boundary
most probably
never thought of it
it is stipulated therein that the mexican forces should evacuate the territory of texas
passing to the other side of the rio grande and in another article it is stipulated that
to prevent collisions between the armies
the texas army should not approach nearer than within five leagues of what is not said
but clearly
from the object stated
it is of the rio grande
if this is a treaty recognizing the rio grande as the boundary of texas
it contains the singular feature of stipulating that texas shall not go within five leagues of her own boundary
next comes the evidence of texas before annexation
and the united states afterwards
exercising jurisdiction beyond the nueces and between the two rivers
this actual exercise of jurisdiction is the very class or quality of evidence we want
it is excellent so far as it goes but does it go far enough
he tells us it went beyond the nueces
but he does not tell us it went to the rio grande
he tells us jurisdiction was exercised between the two rivers
but he does not tell us it was exercised over all the territory between them
some simple minded people think it is possible to cross one river and go beyond it without going all the way to the next
that jurisdiction may be exercised between two rivers without covering all the country between them
i know a man
not very unlike myself
who exercises jurisdiction over a piece of land between the wabash and the mississippi and yet so far is this from being all there is between those rivers that it is just one hundred and fifty two feet long by fifty feet wide
and no part of it much within a hundred miles of either
he has a neighbor between him and the mississippi that is
just across the street
in that direction whom i am sure he could neither persuade nor force to give up his habitation but which nevertheless he could certainly annex
if it were to be done by merely standing on his own side of the street and claiming it
or even sitting down and writing a deed for it
but next the president tells us the congress of the united states understood the state of texas they admitted into the union to extend beyond the nueces
i suppose they did
i certainly so understood it
but how far beyond
that congress did not understand it to extend clear to the rio grande is quite certain
by the fact of their joint resolutions for admission expressly leaving all questions of boundary to future adjustment
and it may be added that texas herself is proven to have had the same understanding of it that our congress had
by the fact of the exact conformity of her new constitution to those resolutions
i am now through the whole of the president's evidence and it is a singular fact that if any one should declare the president sent the army into the midst of a settlement of mexican people who had never submitted
by consent or by force
to the authority of texas or of the united states
and that there and thereby the first blood of the war was shed
there is not one word in all the which would either admit or deny the declaration
this strange omission it does seem to me could not have occurred but by design
my way of living leads me to be about the courts of justice and there i have sometimes seen a good lawyer
struggling for his client's neck in a desperate case
employing every artifice to work round
and cover up with many words some point arising in the case which he dared not admit and yet could not deny
party bias may help to make it appear so
but with all the allowance i can make for such bias
it still does appear to me that just such
and from just such necessity
is the president's struggle in this case
sometime after my colleague mr
richardson introduced the resolutions i have mentioned
i introduced a preamble
and interrogations
intended to draw the president out
if possible
on this hitherto untrodden ground
to show their relevancy
i propose to state my understanding of the true rule for ascertaining the boundary between texas and mexico
it is that wherever texas was exercising jurisdiction was hers and wherever mexico was exercising jurisdiction was hers and that whatever separated the actual exercise of jurisdiction of the one from that of the other was the true boundary between them
as is probably true
texas was exercising jurisdiction along the western bank of the nueces
and mexico was exercising it along the eastern bank of the rio grande
then neither river was the boundary
but the uninhabited country between the two was
the extent of our territory in that region depended not on any treaty fixed boundary for no treaty had attempted it
but on revolution
any people anywhere being inclined and having the power have the right to rise up and shake off the existing government
and form a new one that suits them better
this is a most valuable
a most sacred right a right which we hope and believe is to liberate the world
nor is this right confined to cases in which the whole people of an existing government may choose to exercise it
any portion of such people that can may revolutionize and make their own of so much of the territory as they inhabit
more than this
a majority of any portion of such people may revolutionize
putting down a minority
intermingled with or near about them
who may oppose this movement
such minority was precisely the case of the tories of our own revolution
it is a quality of revolutions not to go by old lines or old laws
but to break up both
and make new ones
as to the country now in question
we bought it of france in 1803
and sold it to spain in 1819
according to the president's statements
after this
all mexico
including texas
revolutionized against spain and still later texas revolutionized against mexico
in my view
just so far as she carried her resolution by obtaining the actual
willing or unwilling
submission of the people
so far the country was hers
and no farther
for the purpose of obtaining the very best evidence as to whether texas had actually carried her revolution to the place where the hostilities of the present war commenced
let the president answer the interrogatories i proposed
as before mentioned
or some other similar ones
let him answer fully
and candidly
let him answer with facts and not with arguments
let him remember he sits where washington sat
and so remembering
let him answer as washington would answer
as a nation should not
and the almighty will not
be evaded
so let him attempt no evasion no equivocation
and if
so answering
he can show that the soil was ours where the first blood of the war was shed
that it was not within an inhabited country
if within such
that the inhabitants had submitted themselves to the civil authority of texas or of the united states
and that the same is true of the site of fort brown
then i am with him for his justification
in that case i shall be most happy to reverse the vote i gave the other day
i have a selfish motive for desiring that the president may do this i expect to gain some votes
in connection with the war
without his so doing
will be of doubtful propriety in my own judgment
but which will be free from the doubt if he does so
but if he can not or will not do this
if on any pretence or no pretence he shall refuse or omit it then i shall be fully convinced of what i more than suspect already that he is deeply conscious of being in the wrong that he feels the blood of this war
like the blood of abel
is crying to heaven against him that originally having some strong motive what
i will not stop now to give my opinion concerning to involve the two countries in a war
and trusting to escape scrutiny by fixing the public gaze upon the exceeding brightness of military glory
that attractive rainbow that rises in showers of blood
that serpent's eye that charms to destroy
he plunged into it
and was swept on and on till
disappointed in his calculation of the ease with which mexico might be subdued
he now finds himself he knows not where
how like the half insane mumbling of a fever dream is the whole war part of his late message
at one time telling us that mexico has nothing whatever that we can get but territory at another showing us how we can support the war by levying contributions on mexico
at one time urging the national honor
the security of the future
the prevention of foreign interference
and even the good of mexico herself as among the objects of the war at another telling us that to reject indemnity
by refusing to accept a cession of territory
would be to abandon all our just demands
and to wage the war
bearing all its expenses
without a purpose or definite object
so then this national honor
security of the future
and everything but territorial indemnity may be considered the no purposes and indefinite objects of the war
having it now settled that territorial indemnity is the only object
we are urged to seize
by legislation here
all that he was content to take a few months ago
and the whole province of lower california to boot
and to still carry on the war to take all we are fighting for
and still fight on
the president is resolved under all circumstances to have full territorial indemnity for the expenses of the war but he forgets to tell us how we are to get the excess after those expenses shall have surpassed the value of the whole of the mexican territory
so again
he insists that the separate national existence of mexico shall be maintained but he does not tell us how this can be done
after we shall have taken all her territory
lest the questions i have suggested be considered speculative merely
let me be indulged a moment in trying to show they are not
the war has gone on some twenty months for the expenses of which
together with an inconsiderable old score
the president now claims about one half of the mexican territory
and that by far the better half
so far as concerns our ability to make anything out of it
it is comparatively uninhabited so that we could establish land offices in it
and raise some money in that way
but the other half is already inhabited
as i understand it
tolerably densely for the nature of the country
and all its lands
or all that are valuable
already appropriated as private property
how then are we to make anything out of these lands with this encumbrance on them
or how remove the encumbrance
i suppose no one would say we should kill the people
or drive them out
or make slaves of them
or confiscate their property
can we make much out of this part of the territory
if the prosecution of the war has in expenses already equalled the better half of the country
how long its future prosecution will be in equalling the less valuable half is not a speculative
but a practical
pressing closely upon us
and yet it is a question which the president seems never to have thought of
as to the mode of terminating the war and securing peace
the president is equally wandering and indefinite
it is to be done by a more vigorous prosecution of the war in the vital parts of the enemy's country and after apparently talking himself tired on this point
the president drops down into a half despairing tone
and tells us that with a people distracted and divided by contending factions
and a government subject to constant changes by successive revolutions
the continued success of our arms may fail to secure a satisfactory peace
then he suggests the propriety of wheedling the mexican people to desert the counsels of their own leaders
trusting in our protestations
to set up a government from which we can secure a satisfactory peace telling us that this may become the only mode of obtaining such a peace
but soon he falls into doubt of this too and then drops back on to the already half abandoned ground of more vigorous prosecution
all this shows that the president is in nowise satisfied with his own positions
first he takes up one
and in attempting to argue us into it he argues himself out of it
then seizes another and goes through the same process
and then
confused at being able to think of nothing new
he snatches up the old one again
which he has some time before cast off
his mind
taxed beyond its power
is running hither and thither
like some tortured creature on a burning surface
finding no position on which it can settle down and be at ease
it is a singular omission in this message that it nowhere intimates when the president expects the war to terminate
at its beginning
general scott was by this same president driven into disfavor if not disgrace
for intimating that peace could not be conquered in less than three or four months
but now
at the end of about twenty months
during which time our arms have given us the most splendid successes
every department and every part
land and water
officers and privates
regulars and volunteers
doing all that men could do
and hundreds of things which it had ever before been thought men could not do after all this
this same president gives a long message
without showing us that as to the end he himself has even an imaginary conception
as i have before said
he knows not where he is
he is a bewildered
and miserably perplexed man
god grant he may be able to show there is not something about his conscience more painful than his mental perplexity
the following is a copy of the so called treaty referred to in the speech

report in the house of representatives
january 19
from the committee on the post office and post roads
made the following report
the committee on the post office and post roads
to whom was referred the petition of messrs
saltmarsh and fuller
as proved to their satisfaction
the mail routes from milledgeville to athens
and from warrenton to decatur
in the state of georgia numbered 2366 and 2380
were let to reeside and avery at 1300 per annum for the former and 1500 for the latter
for the term of four years
to commence on the first day of january
1835 that
previous to the time for commencing the service
reeside sold his interest therein to avery that on the 5th of may
avery sold the whole to these petitioners
saltmarsh and fuller
to take effect from the beginning
january a 1835 that at this time
the assistant postmaster general
being called on for that purpose
consented to the transfer of the contracts from reeside and avery to these petitioners
and promised to have proper entries of the transfer made on the books of the department
was neglected to be done that the petitioners
supposing all was right
in good faith commenced the transportation of the mail on these routes
and after difficulty arose
still trusting that all would be made right
continued the service till december a 1837 that they performed the service to the entire satisfaction of the department
and have never been paid anything for it except that the difficulty occurred as follows
barry was postmaster general at the times of making the contracts and the attempted transfer of them mr
kendall succeeded mr
and finding reeside apparently in debt to the department
and these contracts still standing in the names of reeside and avery
refused to pay for the services under them
otherwise than by credits to reeside afterward
he divided the compensation
still crediting one half to reeside
and directing the other to be paid to the order of avery
who disclaimed all right to it
after discontinuing the service
these petitioners
supposing they might have legal redress against avery
brought suit against him in new orleans in which suit they failed
on the ground that avery had complied with his contract
having done so much toward the transfer as they had accepted and been satisfied with
still later the department sued reeside on his supposed indebtedness
and by a verdict of the jury it was determined that the department was indebted to him in a sum much beyond all the credits given him on the account above stated
under these circumstances
the committee consider the petitioners clearly entitled to relief
and they report a bill accordingly lest
there should be some mistake as to the amount which they have already received
we so frame it as that
by adjustment at the department
they may be paid so much as remains unpaid for services actually performed by them not charging them with the credits given to reeside
the committee think it not improbable that the petitioners purchased the right of avery to be paid for the service from the 1st of january
till their purchase on may 11
1835 but
the evidence on this point being very vague
they forbear to report in favor of allowing it

january 19
dear william
inclosed you find a letter of louis w
what is wanted is that you shall ascertain whether the claim upon the note described has received any dividend in the probate court of christian county
where the estate of mr
overbon williams has been administered on
if nothing is paid on it
withdraw the note and send it to me
so that chandler can see the indorser of it
at all events write me all about it
till i can somehow get it off my hands
i have already been bored more than enough about it not the least of which annoyance is his cursed
and ungodly handwriting
i have made a speech
a copy of which i will send you by next mail
yours as ever
regarding speech on mexican war to william h
february 1
dear william
your letter of the 19th ultimo was received last night
and for which i am much obliged
the only thing in it that i wish to talk to you at once about is that because of my vote for ashmun's amendment you fear that you and i disagree about the war
i regret this
not because of any fear we shall remain disagreed after you have read this letter
but because if you misunderstand i fear other good friends may also
that vote affirms that the war was unnecessarily and unconstitutionally commenced by the president and i will stake my life that if you had been in my place you would have voted just as i did
would you have voted what you felt and knew to be a lie
i know you would not
would you have gone out of the house skulked the vote
i expect not
if you had skulked one vote
you would have had to skulk many more before the end of the session
richardson's resolutions
introduced before i made any move or gave any vote upon the subject
make the direct question of the justice of the war so that no man can be silent if he would
you are compelled to speak and your only alternative is to tell the truth or a lie
i cannot doubt which you would do
this vote has nothing to do in determining my votes on the questions of supplies
i have always intended
and still intend
to vote supplies perhaps not in the precise form recommended by the president
but in a better form for all purposes
except locofoco party purposes
it is in this particular you seem mistaken
the locos are untiring in their efforts to make the impression that all who vote supplies or take part in the war do of necessity approve the president's conduct in the beginning of it but the whigs have from the beginning made and kept the distinction between the two
in the very first act nearly all the whigs voted against the preamble declaring that war existed by the act of mexico and yet nearly all of them voted for the supplies
as to the whig men who have participated in the war
so far as they have spoken in my hearing they do not hesitate to denounce as unjust the president's conduct in the beginning of the war
they do not suppose that such denunciation is directed by undying hatred to him
as the register would have it believed
there are two such whigs on this floor colonel haskell and major james the former fought as a colonel by the side of colonel baker at cerro gordo
and stands side by side with me in the vote that you seem dissatisfied with
the latter
the history of whose capture with cassius clay you well know
had not arrived here when that vote was given but
as i understand
he stands ready to give just such a vote whenever an occasion shall present
who is now here
says the truth is undoubtedly that way and whenever he shall speak out
he will say so
colonel doniphan
the favorite whig of missouri
and who overran all northern mexico
on his return home in a public speech at st
louis condemned the administration in relation to the war
if i remember
who has been through almost the whole war
declares in favor of mr
clay from which i infer that he adopts the sentiments of mr
generally at least
on the other hand
i have heard of but one whig who has been to the war attempting to justify the president's conduct
that one was captain bishop
editor of the charleston courier
and a very clever fellow
i do not mean this letter for the public
but for you
before it reaches you
you will have seen and read my pamphlet speech
and perhaps been scared anew by it
after you get over your scare
read it over again
sentence by sentence
and tell me honestly what you think of it
i condensed all i could for fear of being cut off by the hour rule
and when i got through i had spoken but forty five minutes
yours forever
to william h
february 2
1848 dear william
i just take my pen to say that mr
of georgia
a little
consumptive man
with a voice like logan's
has just concluded the very best speech of an hour's length i ever heard
my old withered dry eyes are full of tears yet
if he writes it out anything like he delivered it
our people shall see a good many copies of it
yours truly
on the mexican war to william h
february 15
dear william
your letter of the 29th january was received last night
being exclusively a constitutional argument
i wish to submit some reflections upon it in the same spirit of kindness that i know actuates you
let me first state what i understand to be your position
it is that if it shall become necessary to repel invasion
the president may
without violation of the constitution
cross the line and invade the territory of another country
and that whether such necessity exists in any given case the president is the sole judge
before going further consider well whether this is or is not your position
if it is
it is a position that neither the president himself
nor any friend of his
so far as i know
has ever taken
their only positions are first
that the soil was ours when the hostilities commenced and second
that whether it was rightfully ours or not
congress had annexed it
and the president for that reason was bound to defend it both of which are as clearly proved to be false in fact as you can prove that your house is mine
the soil was not ours
and congress did not annex or attempt to annex it
but to return to your position
allow the president to invade a neighboring nation whenever he shall deem it necessary to repel an invasion
and you allow him to do so whenever he may choose to say he deems it necessary for such purpose
and you allow him to make war at pleasure
study to see if you can fix any limit to his power in this respect
after having given him so much as you propose
if to day he should choose to say he thinks it necessary to invade canada to prevent the british from invading us
how could you stop him
you may say to him
i see no probability of the british invading us but he will say to you
be silent
i see it
if you don't
the provision of the constitution giving the war making power to congress was dictated
as i understand it
by the following reasons
kings had always been involving and impoverishing their people in wars
pretending generally
if not always
that the good of the people was the object
this our convention understood to be the most oppressive of all kingly oppressions
and they resolved to so frame the constitution that no one man should hold the power of bringing this oppression upon us
but your view destroys the whole matter
and places our president where kings have always stood
write soon again
yours truly
report in the house of representatives
march 9
from the committee on the postoffice and post roads
made the following report
the committee on the post office and post roads
to whom was referred the resolution of the house of representatives entitled an act authorizing postmasters at county seats of justice to receive subscriptions for newspapers and periodicals
to be paid through the agency of the post office department
and for other purposes
beg leave to submit the following report
the committee have reason to believe that a general wish pervades the community at large that some such facility as the proposed measure should be granted by express law
for subscribing
through the agency of the post office department
to newspapers and periodicals which diffuse daily
or monthly intelligence of passing events
compliance with this general wish is deemed to be in accordance with our republican institutions
which can be best sustained by the diffusion of knowledge and the due encouragement of a universal
national spirit of inquiry and discussion of public events through the medium of the public press
the committee
has not been insensible to its duty of guarding the post office department against injurious sacrifices for the accomplishment of this object
whereby its ordinary efficacy might be impaired or embarrassed
it has therefore been a subject of much consideration but it is now confidently hoped that the bill herewith submitted effectually obviates all objections which might exist with regard to a less matured proposition
the committee learned
upon inquiry
that the post office department
in view of meeting the general wish on this subject
made the experiment through one if its own internal regulations
when the new postage system went into operation on the first of july
and that it was continued until the thirtieth of september
but this experiment
for reasons hereafter stated
proved unsatisfactory
and it was discontinued by order of the postmaster general
as far as the committee can at present ascertain
the following seem to have been the principal grounds of dissatisfaction in this experiment
1 the legal responsibility of postmasters receiving newspaper subscriptions
or of their sureties
was not defined
2 the authority was open to all postmasters instead of being limited to those of specific offices
3 the consequence of this extension of authority was that
in innumerable instances
the money
without the previous knowledge or control of the officers of the department who are responsible for the good management of its finances
was deposited in offices where it was improper such funds should be placed and the repayment was ordered
not by the financial officers
but by the postmasters
at points where it was inconvenient to the department so to disburse its funds
4 the inconvenience of accumulating uncertain and fluctuating sums at small offices was felt seriously in consequent overpayments to contractors on their quarterly collecting orders and
in case of private mail routes
in litigation concerning the misapplication of such funds to the special service of supplying mails
5 the accumulation of such funds on draft offices could not be known to the financial clerks of the department in time to control it
and too often this rendered uncertain all their calculations of funds in hand
6 the orders of payment were for the most part issued upon the principal offices
such as new york
where the large offices of publishers are located
causing an illimitable and uncontrollable drain of the department funds from those points where it was essential to husband them for its own regular disbursements
in philadelphia alone this drain averaged 5000 per quarter and in other cities of the seaboard it was proportionate
7 the embarrassment of the department was increased by the illimitable
and irresponsible scattering of its funds from concentrated points suitable for its distributions
to remote
and inconvenient offices
where they could not be again made available till collected by special agents
or were transferred at considerable expense into the principal disbursing offices again
8 there was a vast increase of duties thrown upon the limited force before necessary to conduct the business of the department and from the delay of obtaining vouchers impediments arose to the speedy settlement of accounts with present or retired post masters
causing postponements which endangered the liability of sureties under the act of limitations
and causing much danger of an increase of such cases
9 the most responsible postmasters at the large offices were ordered by the least responsible at small offices to make payments upon their vouchers
without having the means of ascertaining whether these vouchers were genuine or forged
or if genuine
whether the signers were in or out of office
or solvent or defaulters
10 the transaction of this business for subscribers and publishers at the public expense
an the embarrassment
and delay of the department's own business occasioned by it
were not justified by any sufficient remuneration of revenue to sustain the department
as required in every other respect with regard to its agency
the committee
in view of these objections
has been solicitous to frame a bill which would not be obnoxious to them in principle or in practical effect
it is confidently believed that by limiting the offices for receiving subscriptions to less than one tenth of the number authorized by the experiment already tried
and designating the county seat in each county for the purpose
the control of the department will be rendered satisfactory particularly as it will be in the power of the auditor
who is the officer required by law to check the accounts
to approve or disapprove of the deposits
and to sanction not only the payments
but to point out the place of payment
if these payments should cause a drain on the principal offices of the seaboard
it will be compensated by the accumulation of funds at county seats
where the contractors on those routes can be paid to that extent by the department's drafts
with more local convenience to themselves than by drafts on the seaboard offices
the legal responsibility for these deposits is defined
and the accumulation of funds at the point of deposit
and the repayment at points drawn upon
being known to and controlled by the auditor
will not occasion any such embarrassments as were before felt the record kept by the auditor on the passing of the certificates through his hands will enable him to settle accounts without the delay occasioned by vouchers being withheld all doubt or uncertainty as to the genuineness of certificates
or the propriety of their issue
will be removed by the auditor's examination and approval and there can be no risk of loss of funds by transmission
as the certificate will not be payable till sanctioned by the auditor
and after his sanction the payor need not pay it unless it is presented by the publisher or his known clerk or agent
the main principle of equivalent for the agency of the department is secured by the postage required to be paid upon the transmission of the certificates
augmenting adequately the post office revenue
the committee
conceiving that in this report all the difficulties of the subject have been fully and fairly stated
and that these difficulties have been obviated by the plan proposed in the accompanying bill
and believing that the measure will satisfactorily meet the wants and wishes of a very large portion of the community
beg leave to recommend its adoption
report in the house of representatives
march 9
from the committee on the postoffice and post roads
made the following report
the committee on the post office and post roads
to whom was referred the petition of h
postmaster at brimfield
peoria county
that they have been satisfied by evidence
that on the 15th of december
said petitioner had his store
with some fifteen hundred dollars' worth of goods
together with all the papers of the post office
entirely destroyed by fire and that the specie funds of the office were melted down
partially lost and partially destroyed that this large individual loss entirely precludes the idea of embezzlement that the balances due the department of former quarters had been only about twenty five dollars and that owing to the destruction of papers
the exact amount due for the quarter ending december 31
cannot be ascertained
they therefore report a joint resolution
releasing said petitioner from paying anything for the quarter last mentioned
remarks in the united states house of representatives
march 29
the bill for raising additional military force for limited time
was reported from committee on judiciary similar bills had been reported from committee on
public lands and military committee
lincoln said if there was a general desire on the part of the house to pass the bill now he should be glad to have it done concurring
as he did generally
with the gentleman from arkansas mr
johnson that the postponement might jeopard the safety of the proposition
a reference was to be made
he wished to make a very few remarks in relation to the several subjects desired by the gentlemen to be embraced in amendments to the ninth section of the act of the last session of congress
the first amendment desired by members of this house had for its only object to give bounty lands to such persons as had served for a time as privates
but had never been discharged as such
because promoted to office
that subject
and no other
was embraced in this bill
there were some others who desired
while they were legislating on this subject
that they should also give bounty lands to the volunteers of the war of 1812
his friend from maryland said there were no such men
he mr
did not say there were many
but he was very confident there were some
his friend from kentucky near him
gaines told him he himself was one
there was still another proposition touching this matter that was
that persons entitled to bounty lands should by law be entitled to locate these lands in parcels
and not be required to locate them in one body
as was provided by the existing law
now he had carefully drawn up a bill embracing these three separate propositions
which he intended to propose as a substitute for all these bills in the house
or in committee of the whole on the state of the union
at some suitable time
if there was a disposition on the part of the house to act at once on this separate proposition
he repeated that
with the gentlemen from arkansas
he should prefer it lest they should lose all
but if there was to be a reference
he desired to introduce his bill embracing the three propositions
thus enabling the committee and the house to act at the same time
whether favorably or unfavorably
upon all
he inquired whether an amendment was now in order
the speaker replied in the negative
to archibald williams
april 30
dear williams
i have not seen in the papers any evidence of a movement to send a delegate from your circuit to the june convention
i wish to say that i think it all important that a delegate should be sent
clay's chance for an election is just no chance at all
he might get new york
and that would have elected in 1844
but it will not now
because he must now
at the least
lose tennessee
which he had then
and in addition the fifteen new votes of florida
and wisconsin
i know our good friend browning is a great admirer of mr
and i therefore fear he is favoring his nomination
if he is
ask him to discard feeling
and try if he can possibly
as a matter of judgment
count the votes necessary to elect him
in my judgment we can elect nobody but general taylor and we cannot elect him without a nomination
therefore don't fail to send a delegate
your friend as ever
remarks in the house of representatives
may 11
a bill for the admission of wisconsin into the union had been passed
lincoln moved to reconsider the vote by which the bill was passed
he stated to the house that he had made this motion for the purpose of obtaining an opportunity to say a few words in relation to a point raised in the course of the debate on this bill
which he would now proceed to make if in order
the point in the case to which he referred arose on the amendment that was submitted by the gentleman from vermont mr
collamer in committee of the whole on the state of the union
and which was afterward renewed in the house
in relation to the question whether the reserved sections
by some bills heretofore passed
by which an appropriation of land had been made to wisconsin
had been enhanced in value
should be reduced to the minimum price of the public lands
the question of the reduction in value of those sections was to him at this time a matter very nearly of indifference
he was inclined to desire that wisconsin should be obliged by having it reduced
but the gentleman from indiana mr
the chairman of the committee on territories
yesterday associated that question with the general question
which is now to some extent agitated in congress
of making appropriations of alternate sections of land to aid the states in making internal improvements
and enhancing the price of the sections reserved
and the gentleman from indiana took ground against that policy
he did not make any special argument in favor of wisconsin
but he took ground generally against the policy of giving alternate sections of land
and enhancing the price of the reserved sections
now he mr
lincoln did not at this time take the floor for the purpose of attempting to make an argument on the general subject
he rose simply to protest against the doctrine which the gentleman from indiana had avowed in the course of what he mr
lincoln could not but consider an unsound argument
it might
be true
for anything he knew
that the gentleman from indiana might convince him that his argument was sound but he mr
lincoln feared that gentleman would not be able to convince a majority in congress that it was sound
it was true the question appeared in a different aspect to persons in consequence of a difference in the point from which they looked at it
it did not look to persons residing east of the mountains as it did to those who lived among the public lands
for his part
he would state that if congress would make a donation of alternate sections of public land for the purpose of internal improvements in his state
and forbid the reserved sections being sold at 1
he should be glad to see the appropriation made though he should prefer it if the reserved sections were not enhanced in price
he repeated
he should be glad to have such appropriations made
even though the reserved sections should be enhanced in price
he did not wish to be understood as concurring in any intimation that they would refuse to receive such an appropriation of alternate sections of land because a condition enhancing the price of the reserved sections should be attached thereto
he believed his position would now be understood
if not
he feared he should not be able to make himself understood
before he took his seat
he would remark that the senate during the present session had passed a bill making appropriations of land on that principle for the benefit of the state in which he resided the state of illinois
the alternate sections were to be given for the purpose of constructing roads
and the reserved sections were to be enhanced in value in consequence
when that bill came here for the action of this house it had been received
and was now before the committee on public lands he desired much to see it passed as it was
if it could be put in no more favorable form for the state of illinois
when it should be before this house
if any member from a section of the union in which these lands did not lie
whose interest might be less than that which he felt
should propose a reduction of the price of the reserved sections to 1
he should be much obliged but he did not think it would be well for those who came from the section of the union in which the lands lay to do so
he wished it
to be understood that he did not join in the warfare against the principle which had engaged the minds of some members of congress who were favorable to the improvements in the western country
there was a good deal of force
he admitted
in what fell from the chairman of the committee on territories
it might be that there was no precise justice in raising the price of the reserved sections to 2
50 per acre
it might be proper that the price should be enhanced to some extent
though not to double the usual price but he should be glad to have such an appropriation with the reserved sections at 2
50 he should be better pleased to have the price of those sections at something less and he should be still better pleased to have them without any enhancement at all
there was one portion of the argument of the gentleman from indiana
the chairman of the committee on territories mr
which he wished to take occasion to say that he did not view as unsound
he alluded to the statement that the general government was interested in these internal improvements being made
inasmuch as they increased the value of the lands that were unsold
and they enabled the government to sell the lands which could not be sold without them
the government gained by internal improvements as well as by the general good which the people derived from them
and it might be
that the lands should not be sold for more than 1
50 instead of the price being doubled
merely mentioned this in passing
for he only rose to state
as the principle of giving these lands for the purposes which he had mentioned had been laid hold of and considered favorably
and as there were some gentlemen who had constitutional scruples about giving money for these purchases who would not hesitate to give land
that he was not willing to have it understood that he was one of those who made war against that principle
this was all he desired to say
and having accomplished the object with which he rose
he withdrew his motion to reconsider
on taylor's nomination to e
april 30
dear washburne
i have this moment received your very short note asking me if old taylor is to be used up
and who will be the nominee
my hope of taylor's nomination is as high a little higher than it was when you left
the case is by no means out of doubt
clay's letter has not advanced his interests any here
several who were against taylor
but not for anybody particularly
are since taking ground
some for scott and some for mclean
who will be nominated neither i nor any one else can tell
let me pray to you in turn
my prayer is that you let nothing discourage or baffle you
but that
in spite of every difficulty
you send us a good taylor delegate from your circuit
make baker
who is now with you
i suppose
help about it
he is a good hand to raise a breeze
general ashley

nothing else new beyond what you see in the papers
yours truly
lincoln defense of mexican war position to rev
peck washington
may 21
dear sir
not in view of all the facts
there are facts which you have kept out of view
it is a fact that the united states army in marching to the rio grande marched into a peaceful mexican settlement
and frightened the inhabitants away from their homes and their growing crops
it is a fact that fort brown
opposite matamoras
was built by that army within a mexican cotton field
on which at the time the army reached it a young cotton crop was growing
and which crop was wholly destroyed and the field itself greatly and permanently injured by ditches
and the like
it is a fact that when the mexicans captured captain thornton and his command
they found and captured them within another mexican field
now i wish to bring these facts to your notice
and to ascertain what is the result of your reflections upon them
if you deny that they are facts
i think i can furnish proofs which shall convince you that you are mistaken
if you admit that they are facts
then i shall be obliged for a reference to any law of language
law of states
law of nations
law of morals
law of religions
any law
human or divine
in which an authority can be found for saying those facts constitute no aggression
possibly you consider those acts too small for notice
would you venture to so consider them had they been committed by any nation on earth against the humblest of our people
i know you would not
then i ask
is the precept whatsoever ye would that men should do to you
do ye even so to them obsolete
of no force
of no application
yours truly
on zachary taylor nomination to archibald williams
june 12
dear williams
on my return from philadelphia
where i had been attending the nomination of old rough
zachary taylor i found your letter in a mass of others which had accumulated in my absence
by many
and often
it had been said they would not abide the nomination of taylor but since the deed has been done
they are fast falling in
and in my opinion we shall have a most overwhelming
glorious triumph
one unmistakable sign is that all the odds and ends are with us barnburners
native americans
tyler men
disappointed office seeking locofocos
and the lord knows what
this is important
if in nothing else
in showing which way the wind blows
some of the sanguine men have set down all the states as certain for taylor but illinois
and it as doubtful
cannot something be done even in illinois
taylor's nomination takes the locos on the blind side
it turns the war thunder against them
the war is now to them the gallows of haman
which they built for us
and on which they are doomed to be hanged themselves
excuse this short letter
i have so many to write that i cannot devote much time to any one
yours as ever
speech in the house of representatives
june 20
in committee of the whole on the state of the union
on the civil and diplomatic appropriation bill
i wish at all times in no way to practise any fraud upon the house or the committee
and i also desire to do nothing which may be very disagreeable to any of the members
i therefore state in advance that my object in taking the floor is to make a speech on the general subject of internal improvements and if i am out of order in doing so
i give the chair an opportunity of so deciding
and i will take my seat
the chair
i will not undertake to anticipate what the gentleman may say on the subject of internal improvements
he will
proceed in his remarks
and if any question of order shall be made
the chair will then decide it
at an early day of this session the president sent us what may properly be called an internal improvement veto message
the late democratic convention
which sat at baltimore
and which nominated general cass for the presidency
adopted a set of resolutions
now called the democratic platform
among which is one in these words
that the constitution does not confer upon the general government the power to commence and carry on a general system of internal improvements
general cass
in his letter accepting the nomination
holds this language
i have carefully read the resolutions of the democratic national convention
laying down the platform of our political faith
and i adhere to them as firmly as i approve them cordially
these things
taken together
show that the question of internal improvements is now more distinctly made has become more intense than at any former period
the veto message and the baltimore resolution i understand to be
in substance
the same thing the latter being the more general statement
of which the former is the amplification the bill of particulars
while i know there are many democrats
on this floor and elsewhere
who disapprove that message
i understand that all who voted for general cass will thereafter be counted as having approved it
as having indorsed all its doctrines
i suppose all
or nearly all
the democrats will vote for him
many of them will do so not because they like his position on this question
but because they prefer him
being wrong on this
to another whom they consider farther wrong on other questions
in this way the internal improvement democrats are to be
by a sort of forced consent
carried over and arrayed against themselves on this measure of policy
general cass
once elected
will not trouble himself to make a constitutional argument
or perhaps any argument at all
when he shall veto a river or harbor bill he will consider it a sufficient answer to all democratic murmurs to point to mr
polk's message
and to the democratic platform
this being the case
the question of improvements is verging to a final crisis and the friends of this policy must now battle
and battle manfully
or surrender all
in this view
humble as i am
i wish to review
and contest as well as i may
the general positions of this veto message
when i say general positions
i mean to exclude from consideration so much as relates to the present embarrassed state of the treasury in consequence of the mexican war
those general positions are
that internal improvements ought not to be made by the general government first
because they would overwhelm the treasury second
while their burdens would be general
their benefits would be local and partial
involving an obnoxious inequality and third
because they would be unconstitutional
because the states may do enough by the levy and collection of tonnage duties or if not fifth
that the constitution may be amended
do nothing at all
lest you do something wrong
is the sum of these positions is the sum of this message
and this
with the exception of what is said about constitutionality
applying as forcibly to what is said about making improvements by state authority as by the national authority so that we must abandon the improvements of the country altogether
by any and every authority
or we must resist and repudiate the doctrines of this message
let us attempt the latter
the first position is
that a system of internal improvements would overwhelm the treasury
that in such a system there is a tendency to undue expansion
is not to be denied
such tendency is founded in the nature of the subject
a member of congress will prefer voting for a bill which contains an appropriation for his district
to voting for one which does not and when a bill shall be expanded till every district shall be provided for
that it will be too greatly expanded is obvious
but is this any more true in congress than in a state legislature
if a member of congress must have an appropriation for his district
so a member of a legislature must have one for his county
and if one will overwhelm the national treasury
so the other will overwhelm the state treasury
go where we will
the difficulty is the same
allow it to drive us from the halls of congress
and it will
just as easily
drive us from the state legislatures
let us
grapple with it
and test its strength
let us
judging of the future by the past
ascertain whether there may not be
in the discretion of congress
a sufficient power to limit and restrain this expansive tendency within reasonable and proper bounds
the president himself values the evidence of the past
he tells us that at a certain point of our history more than two hundred millions of dollars had been applied for to make improvements and this he does to prove that the treasury would be overwhelmed by such a system
why did he not tell us how much was granted
would not that have been better evidence
let us turn to it
and see what it proves
in the message the president tells us that during the four succeeding years embraced by the administration of president adams
the power not only to appropriate money
but to apply it
under the direction and authority of the general government
as well to the construction of roads as to the improvement of harbors and rivers
was fully asserted and exercised
this
was the period of greatest enormity
if any
must have been the days of the two hundred millions
and how much do you suppose was really expended for improvements during that four years
two hundred millions
one hundred
sir less than two millions
as shown by authentic documents
the expenditures on improvements during 1825
and 1828 amounted to one million eight hundred and seventy nine thousand six hundred and twenty seven dollars and one cent
these four years were the period of mr
adams's administration
nearly and substantially
this fact shows that when the power to make improvements was fully asserted and exercised
the congress did keep within reasonable limits and what has been done
it seems to me
can be done again
now for the second portion of the message namely
that the burdens of improvements would be general
while their benefits would be local and partial
involving an obnoxious inequality
that there is some degree of truth in this position
i shall not deny
no commercial object of government patronage can be so exclusively general as to not be of some peculiar local advantage
the navy
as i understand it
was established
and is maintained at a great annual expense
partly to be ready for war when war shall come
and partly also
and perhaps chiefly
for the protection of our commerce on the high seas
this latter object is
for all i can see
in principle the same as internal improvements
the driving a pirate from the track of commerce on the broad ocean
and the removing of a snag from its more narrow path in the mississippi river
i think
be distinguished in principle
each is done to save life and property
and for nothing else
the navy
is the most general in its benefits of all this class of objects and yet even the navy is of some peculiar advantage to charleston
new york
and boston
beyond what it is to the interior towns of illinois
the next most general object i can think of would be improvements on the mississippi river and its tributaries
they touch thirteen of our states pennsylvania
and iowa
now i suppose it will not be denied that these thirteen states are a little more interested in improvements on that great river than are the remaining seventeen
these instances of the navy and the mississippi river show clearly that there is something of local advantage in the most general objects
but the converse is also true
nothing is so local as to not be of some general benefit
for instance
the illinois and michigan canal
considered apart from its effects
it is perfectly local
every inch of it is within the state of illinois
that canal was first opened for business last april
in a very few days we were all gratified to learn
among other things
that sugar had been carried from new orleans through this canal to buffalo in new york
this sugar took this route
because it was cheaper than the old route
supposing benefit of the reduction in the cost of carriage to be shared between seller and the buyer
result is that the new orleans merchant sold his sugar a little dearer
and the people of buffalo sweetened their coffee a little cheaper
than before
a benefit resulting from the canal
not to illinois
where the canal is
but to louisiana and new york
where it is not
in other transactions illinois will
of course
have her share
and perhaps the larger share too
of the benefits of the canal but this instance of the sugar clearly shows that the benefits of an improvement are by no means confined to the particular locality of the improvement itself
the just conclusion from all this is that if the nation refuse to make improvements of the more general kind because their benefits may be somewhat local
a state may for the same reason refuse to make an improvement of a local kind because its benefits may be somewhat general
a state may well say to the nation
if you will do nothing for me
i will do nothing for you
thus it is seen that if this argument of inequality is sufficient anywhere
it is sufficient everywhere
and puts an end to improvements altogether
i hope and believe that if both the nation and the states would
in good faith
in their respective spheres do what they could in the way of improvements
what of inequality might be produced in one place might be compensated in another
and the sum of the whole might not be very unequal
but suppose
after all
there should be some degree of inequality
inequality is certainly never to be embraced for its own sake but is every good thing to be discarded which may be inseparably connected with some degree of it
if so
we must discard all government
this capitol is built at the public expense
for the public benefit but does any one doubt that it is of some peculiar local advantage to the property holders and business people of washington
shall we remove it for this reason
and if so
where shall we set it down
and be free from the difficulty
to make sure of our object
shall we locate it nowhere
and have congress hereafter to hold its sessions
as the loafer lodged
in spots about
i make no allusion to the present president when i say there are few stronger cases in this world of burden to the many and benefit to the few
of inequality
than the presidency itself is by some thought to be
an honest laborer digs coal at about seventy cents a day
while the president digs abstractions at about seventy dollars a day
the coal is clearly worth more than the abstractions
and yet what a monstrous inequality in the prices
does the president
for this reason
propose to abolish the presidency
he does not
and he ought not
the true rule
in determining to embrace or reject anything
is not whether it have any evil in it
but whether it have more of evil than of good
there are few things wholly evil or wholly good
almost everything
especially of government policy
is an inseparable compound of the two so that our best judgment of the preponderance between them is continually demanded
on this principle the president
his friends
and the world generally act on most subjects
why not apply it
upon this question
as to improvements
magnify the evil
and stoutly refuse to see any good in them
on the third position of the message the constitutional question i have not much to say
being the man i am
and speaking
where i do
i feel that in any attempt at an original constitutional argument i should not be and ought not to be listened to patiently
the ablest and the best of men have gone over the whole ground long ago
i shall attempt but little more than a brief notice of what some of them have said
in relation to mr
jefferson's views
i read from mr
polk's veto message
president jefferson
in his message to congress in 1806
recommended an amendment of the constitution
with a view to apply an anticipated surplus in the treasury 'to the great purposes of the public education
and such other objects of public improvement as it may be thought proper to add to the constitutional enumeration of the federal powers' and he adds
i suppose an amendment to the constitution
by consent of the states
because the objects now recommended are not among those enumerated in the constitution
and to which it permits the public moneys to be applied
 in 1825
he repeated in his published letters the opinion that no such power has been conferred upon congress
i introduce this not to controvert just now the constitutional opinion
but to show that
on the question of expediency
jefferson's opinion was against the present president that this opinion of mr
in one branch at least
is in the hands of mr
polk like mcfingal's gun bears wide and kicks the owner over
but to the constitutional question
in 1826 chancellor kent first published his commentaries on american law
he devoted a portion of one of the lectures to the question of the authority of congress to appropriate public moneys for internal improvements
he mentions that the subject had never been brought under judicial consideration
and proceeds to give a brief summary of the discussion it had undergone between the legislative and executive branches of the government
he shows that the legislative branch had usually been for
and the executive against
the power
till the period of mr
adams's administration
at which point he considers the executive influence as withdrawn from opposition
and added to the support of the power
in 1844 the chancellor published a new edition of his commentaries
in which he adds some notes of what had transpired on the question since 1826
i have not time to read the original text on the notes but the whole may be found on page 267
and the two or three following pages
of the first volume of the edition of 1844
as to what chancellor kent seems to consider the sum of the whole
i read from one of the notes
justice story
in his commentaries on the constitution of the united states
and again pp
has stated at large the arguments for and against the proposition that congress have a constitutional authority to lay taxes and to apply the power to regulate commerce as a means directly to encourage and protect domestic manufactures and without giving any opinion of his own on the contested doctrine
he has left the reader to draw his own conclusions
i should think
from the arguments as stated
that every mind which has taken no part in the discussion
and felt no prejudice or territorial bias on either side of the question
would deem the arguments in favor of the congressional power vastly superior
it will be seen that in this extract the power to make improvements is not directly mentioned but by examining the context
both of kent and story
it will be seen that the power mentioned in the extract and the power to make improvements are regarded as identical
it is not to be denied that many great and good men have been against the power but it is insisted that quite as many
as great and as good
have been for it and it is shown that
on a full survey of the whole
chancellor kent was of opinion that the arguments of the latter were vastly superior
this is but the opinion of a man but who was that man
he was one of the ablest and most learned lawyers of his age
or of any age
it is no disparagement to mr
nor indeed to any one who devotes much time to politics
to be placed far behind chancellor kent as a lawyer
his attitude was most favorable to correct conclusions
he wrote coolly
and in retirement
he was struggling to rear a durable monument of fame and he well knew that truth and thoroughly sound reasoning were the only sure foundations
can the party opinion of a party president on a law question
as this purely is
be at all compared or set in opposition to that of such a man
in such an attitude
as chancellor kent
this constitutional question will probably never be better settled than it is
until it shall pass under judicial consideration but i do think no man who is clear on the questions of expediency need feel his conscience much pricked upon this
the president seems to think that enough may be done
in the way of improvements
by means of tonnage duties under state authority
with the consent of the general government
now i suppose this matter of tonnage duties is well enough in its own sphere
i suppose it may be efficient
and perhaps sufficient
to make slight improvements and repairs in harbors already in use and not much out of repair
but if i have any correct general idea of it
it must be wholly inefficient for any general beneficent purposes of improvement
i know very little
or rather nothing at all
of the practical matter of levying and collecting tonnage duties but i suppose one of its principles must be to lay a duty for the improvement of any particular harbor upon the tonnage coming into that harbor to do otherwise to collect money in one harbor
to be expended on improvements in another would be an extremely aggravated form of that inequality which the president so much deprecates
if i be right in this
how could we make any entirely new improvement by means of tonnage duties
how make a road
a canal
or clear a greatly obstructed river
the idea that we could involves the same absurdity as the irish bull about the new boots
i shall niver git 'em on
says patrick
till i wear 'em a day or two
and stretch 'em a little
we shall never make a canal by tonnage duties until it shall already have been made awhile
so the tonnage can get into it
after all
the president concludes that possibly there may be some great objects of improvement which cannot be effected by tonnage duties
and which it therefore may be expedient for the general government to take in hand
accordingly he suggests
in case any such be discovered
the propriety of amending the constitution
amend it for what
like mr
the president thought improvements expedient
but not constitutional
it would be natural enough for him to recommend such an amendment
but hear what he says in this very message
in view of these portentous consequences
i cannot but think that this course of legislation should be arrested
even were there nothing to forbid it in the fundamental laws of our union
for what
would he have the constitution amended
with him it is a proposition to remove one impediment merely to be met by others which
in his opinion
cannot be removed
to enable congress to do what
in his opinion
they ought not to do if they could
here mr
meade of virginia inquired if mr
lincoln understood the president to be opposed
on grounds of expediency
to any and every improvement
lincoln answered
in the very part of his message of which i am speaking
i understand him as giving some vague expression in favor of some possible objects of improvement but in doing so i understand him to be directly on the teeth of his own arguments in other parts of it
neither the president nor any one can possibly specify an improvement which shall not be clearly liable to one or another of the objections he has urged on the score of expediency
i have shown
and might show again
that no work no object can be so general as to dispense its benefits with precise equality and this inequality is chief among the portentous consequences for which he declares that improvements should be arrested
when the president intimates that something in the way of improvements may properly be done by the general government
he is shrinking from the conclusions to which his own arguments would force him
he feels that the improvements of this broad and goodly land are a mighty interest and he is unwilling to confess to the people
or perhaps to himself
that he has built an argument which
when pressed to its conclusions
entirely annihilates this interest
i have already said that no one who is satisfied of the expediency of making improvements needs be much uneasy in his conscience about its constitutionality
i wish now to submit a few remarks on the general proposition of amending the constitution
as a general rule
i think we would much better let it alone
no slight occasion should tempt us to touch it
better not take the first step
which may lead to a habit of altering it
habituate ourselves to think of it as unalterable
it can scarcely be made better than it is
new provisions would introduce new difficulties
and thus create and increase appetite for further change
sir let it stand as it is
new hands have never touched it
the men who made it have done their work
and have passed away
who shall improve on what they did
for the purpose of reviewing this message in the least possible time
as well as for the sake of distinctness
i have analyzed its arguments as well as i could
and reduced them to the propositions i have stated
i have now examined them in detail
i wish to detain the committee only a little while longer with some general remarks upon the subject of improvements
that the subject is a difficult one
cannot be denied
still it is no more difficult in congress than in the state legislatures
in the counties
or in the smallest municipal districts which anywhere exist
all can recur to instances of this difficulty in the case of county roads
and the like
one man is offended because a road passes over his land
and another is offended because it does not pass over his one is dissatisfied because the bridge for which he is taxed crosses the river on a different road from that which leads from his house to town another cannot bear that the county should be got in debt for these same roads and bridges while not a few struggle hard to have roads located over their lands
and then stoutly refuse to let them be opened until they are first paid the damages
even between the different wards and streets of towns and cities we find this same wrangling and difficulty
now these are no other than the very difficulties against which
and out of which
the president constructs his objections of inequality
speculation
and crushing the treasury
there is but a single alternative about them
they are sufficient
or they are not
if sufficient
they are sufficient out of congress as well as in it
and there is the end
we must reject them as insufficient
or lie down and do nothing by any authority
difficulty though there be
let us meet and encounter it
attempt the end
and never stand to doubt nothing so hard
but search will find it out
determine that the thing can and shall be done
and then we shall find the way
the tendency to undue expansion is unquestionably the chief difficulty
how to do something
and still not do too much
is the desideratum
let each contribute his mite in the way of suggestion
the late silas wright
in a letter to the chicago convention
contributed his
which was worth something and i now contribute mine
which may be worth nothing
at all events
it will mislead nobody
and therefore will do no harm
i would not borrow money
i am against an overwhelming
crushing system
suppose that
at each session
congress shall first determine how much money can
for that year
be spared for improvements then apportion that sum to the most important objects
so far all is easy but how shall we determine which are the most important
on this question comes the collision of interests
i shall be slow to acknowledge that your harbor or your river is more important than mine
and vice versa
to clear this difficulty
let us have that same statistical information which the gentleman from ohio mr
vinton suggested at the beginning of this session
in that information we shall have a stern
unbending basis of facts a basis in no wise subject to whim
or local interest
the prelimited amount of means will save us from doing too much
and the statistics will save us from doing what we do in wrong places
adopt and adhere to this course
it seems to me
the difficulty is cleared
one of the gentlemen from south carolina mr
rhett very much deprecates these statistics
he particularly objects
as i understand him
to counting all the pigs and chickens in the land
i do not perceive much force in the objection
it is true that if everything be enumerated
a portion of such statistics may not be very useful to this object
such products of the country as are to be consumed where they are produced need no roads or rivers
no means of transportation
and have no very proper connection with this subject
the surplus that which is produced in one place to be consumed in another the capacity of each locality for producing a greater surplus the natural means of transportation
and their susceptibility of improvement the hindrances
and losses of life and property during transportation
and the causes of each
would be among the most valuable statistics in this connection
from these it would readily appear where a given amount of expenditure would do the most good
these statistics might be equally accessible
as they would be equally useful
to both the nation and the states
in this way
and by these means
let the nation take hold of the larger works
and the states the smaller ones and thus
working in a meeting direction
but steadily and firmly
what is made unequal in one place may be equalized in another
extravagance avoided
and the whole country put on that career of prosperity which shall correspond with its extent of territory
its natural resources
and the intelligence and enterprise of its people
opportunities for young politicians to william h
june 22
dear william
last night i was attending a sort of caucus of the whig members
held in relation to the coming presidential election
the whole field of the nation was scanned
and all is high hope and confidence
illinois is expected to better her condition in this race
under these circumstances
judge how heartrending it was to come to my room and find and read your discouraging letter of the 15th
we have made no gains
but have lost h
and four or five more
tell arney to reconsider
if he would be saved
baker and i used to do something
but i think you attach more importance to our absence than is just
there is another cause
in 1840
for instance
we had two senators and five representatives in sangamon now we have part of one senator and two representatives
with quite one third more people than we had then
we have only half the sort of offices which are sought by men of the speaking sort of talent
i think
is the chief cause
as to the young men
you must not wait to be brought forward by the older men
for instance
do you suppose that i should ever have got into notice if i had waited to be hunted up and pushed forward by older men
you young men get together and form a rough and ready club
and have regular meetings and speeches
take in everybody you can get
harrison grimsley
lee kimball
and c
matheny will do to begin the thing but as you go along gather up all the shrewd
wild boys about town
whether just of age
or a little under age
reddick ridgely
lewis zwizler
and hundreds such
let every one play the part he can play best
some speak
some sing
and all holler
your meetings will be of evenings the older men
and the women
will go to hear you so that it will not only contribute to the election of old zach
but will be an interesting pastime
and improving to the intellectual faculties of all engaged
don't fail to do this
you ask me to send you all the speeches made about old zach
the war
now this makes me a little impatient
i have regularly sent you the congressional globe and appendix
and you cannot have examined them
or you would have discovered that they contain every speech made by every man in both houses of congress
on every subject
during the session
can i send any more
can i send speeches that nobody has made
thinking it would be most natural that the newspapers would feel interested to give at least some of the speeches to their readers
i at the beginning of the session made arrangements to have one copy of the globe and appendix regularly sent to each whig paper of the district
and yet
with the exception of my own little speech
which was published in two only of the then five
now four
whig papers
i do not remember having seen a single speech
or even extract from one
in any single one of those papers
with equal and full means on both sides
i will venture that the state register has thrown before its readers more of locofoco speeches in a month than all the whig papers of the district have done of whig speeches during the session
if you wish a full understanding of the war
i repeat what i believe i said to you in a letter once before
that the whole
or nearly so
is to be found in the speech of dixon of connecticut
this i sent you in pamphlet as well as in the globe
examine and study every sentence of that speech thoroughly
and you will understand the whole subject
you ask how congress came to declare that war had existed by the act of mexico
is it possible you don't understand that yet
you have at least twenty speeches in your possession that fully explain it
i will
try it once more
the news reached washington of the commencement of hostilities on the rio grande
and of the great peril of general taylor's army
whigs and democrats
was for sending them aid
in men and money
it was necessary to pass a bill for this
the locos had a majority in both houses
and they brought in a bill with a preamble saying
war exists by the act of mexico
therefore we send general taylor money
the whigs moved to strike out the preamble
so that they could vote to send the men and money
without saying anything about how the war commenced but being in the minority
they were voted down
and the preamble was retained
on the passage of the bill
the question came upon them
shall we vote for preamble and bill together
or against both together
they did not want to vote against sending help to general taylor
and therefore they voted for both together
is there any difficulty in understanding this
even my little speech shows how this was and if you will go to the library
you may get the journal of 1845 46
in which you will find the whole for yourself
we have nothing published yet with special reference to the taylor race but we soon will have
and then i will send them to everybody
i made an internal improvement speech day before yesterday
which i shall send home as soon as i can get it written out and printed
and which i suppose nobody will read
your friend as ever
salary of judge in western virginia remarks in the house of representatives
june 28
discussion as to salary of judge of western virginia
wishing to increase it from 1800 to 2500
lincoln said he felt unwilling to be either unjust or ungenerous
and he wanted to understand the real case of this judicial officer
the gentleman from virginia had stated that he had to hold eleven courts
now everybody knew that it was not the habit of the district judges of the united states in other states to hold anything like that number of courts and he therefore took it for granted that this must happen under a peculiar law which required that large number of courts to be holden every year and these laws
he further supposed
were passed at the request of the people of that judicial district
it came
to this
that the people in the western district of virginia had got eleven courts to be held among them in one year
for their own accommodation and being thus better accommodated than neighbors elsewhere
they wanted their judge to be a little better paid
in illinois there had been until the present season but one district court held in the year
there were now to be two
could it be that the western district of virginia furnished more business for a judge than the whole state of illinois

july 10
dear william
your letter covering the newspaper slips was received last night
the subject of that letter is exceedingly painful to me
and i cannot but think there is some mistake in your impression of the motives of the old men
i suppose i am now one of the old men and i declare on my veracity
which i think is good with you
that nothing could afford me more satisfaction than to learn that you and others of my young friends at home were doing battle in the contest and endearing themselves to the people and taking a stand far above any i have ever been able to reach in their admiration
i cannot conceive that other men feel differently
of course i cannot demonstrate what i say but i was young once
and i am sure i was never ungenerously thrust back
i hardly know what to say
the way for a young man to rise is to improve himself every way he can
never suspecting that anybody wishes to hinder him
allow me to assure you that suspicion and jealousy never did help any man in any situation
there may sometimes be ungenerous attempts to keep a young man down and they will succeed
if he allows his mind to be diverted from its true channel to brood over the attempted injury
cast about and see if this feeling has not injured every person you have ever known to fall into it
in what i have said i am sure you will suspect nothing but sincere friendship
i would save you from a fatal error
you have been a studious young man
you are far better informed on almost all subjects than i ever have been
you cannot fail in any laudable object unless you allow your mind to be improperly directed
i have some the advantage of you in the world's experience
merely by being older and it is this that induces me to advise
you still seem to be a little mistaken about the congressional globe and appendix
they contain all of the speeches that are published in any way
my speech and dayton's speech which you say you got in pamphlet form are both word for word in the appendix
i repeat again
all are there
your friend
as ever
general taylor and the veto speech in the house of representatives
july 27
our democratic friends seem to be in a great distress because they think our candidate for the presidency don't suit us
most of them cannot find out that general taylor has any principles at all some
have discovered that he has one
but that one is entirely wrong
this one principle is his position on the veto power
the gentleman from tennessee mr
stanton who has just taken his seat
has said there is very little
if any
difference on this question between general taylor and all the presidents and he seems to think it sufficient detraction from general taylor's position on it that it has nothing new in it
but all others whom i have heard speak assail it furiously
a new member from kentucky mr
of very considerable ability
was in particular concerned about it
he thought it altogether novel and unprecedented for a president or a presidential candidate to think of approving bills whose constitutionality may not be entirely clear to his own mind
he thinks the ark of our safety is gone unless presidents shall always veto such bills as in their judgment may be of doubtful constitutionality
however clear congress may be on their authority to pass any particular act
the gentleman from kentucky thinks the president must veto it if he has doubts about it
now i have neither time nor inclination to argue with the gentleman on the veto power as an original question but i wish to show that general taylor
and not he
agrees with the earlier statesmen on this question
when the bill chartering the first bank of the united states passed congress
its constitutionality was questioned
then in the house of representatives
as well as others
had opposed it on that ground
general washington
as president
was called on to approve or reject it
he sought and obtained on the constitutionality question the separate written opinions of jefferson
and edmund randolph
they then being respectively secretary of state
secretary of the treasury
and attorney general
hamilton's opinion was for the power while randolph's and jefferson's were both against it
after giving his opinion deciding only against the constitutionality of the bill
closes his letter with the paragraph which i now read
it must be admitted
that unless the president's mind
on a view of everything which is urged for and against this bill
is tolerably clear that it is unauthorized by the constitution
if the pro and con hang so even as to balance his judgment
a just respect for the wisdom of the legislature would naturally decide the balance in favor of their opinion
it is chiefly for cases where they are clearly misled by error
or interest
that the constitution has placed a check in the negative of the president
thomas jefferson
february 15
general taylor's opinion
as expressed in his allison letter
is as i now read
the power given by the veto is a high conservative power but
in my opinion
should never be exercised except in cases of clear violation of the constitution
or manifest haste and want of consideration by congress
it is here seen that
in mr
jefferson's opinion
if on the constitutionality of any given bill the president doubts
he is not to veto it
as the gentleman from kentucky would have him do
but is to defer to congress and approve it
and if we compare the opinion of jefferson and taylor
as expressed in these paragraphs
we shall find them more exactly alike than we can often find any two expressions having any literal difference
none but interested faultfinders
i think
can discover any substantial variation
but gentlemen on the other side are unanimously agreed that general taylor has no other principles
they are in utter darkness as to his opinions on any of the questions of policy which occupy the public attention
but is there any doubt as to what he will do on the prominent questions if elected
not the least
it is not possible to know what he will or would do in every imaginable case
because many questions have passed away
and others doubtless will arise which none of us have yet thought of but on the prominent questions of currency
internal improvements
and wilmot proviso
general taylor's course is at least as well defined as is general cass's
in their eagerness to get at general taylor
several democratic members here have desired to know whether
in case of his election
a bankrupt law is to be established
can they tell us general cass's opinion on this question
some member answered
he is against it
aye
how do you know he is
there is nothing about it in the platform
nor elsewhere
that i have seen
if the gentleman knows of anything which i do not know he can show it
but to return
general taylor
in his allison letter
upon the subject of the tariff
the currency
the improvement of our great highways
and harbors
the will of the people
as expressed through their representatives in congress
ought to be respected and carried out by the executive
now this is the whole matter
in substance
it is this
the people say to general taylor
if you are elected
shall we have a national bank
he answers
your will
not mine
what about the tariff
say yourselves
shall our rivers and harbors be improved
just as you please
if you desire a bank
an alteration of the tariff
internal improvements
any or all
i will not hinder you
if you do not desire them
i will not attempt to force them on you
send up your members of congress from the various districts
with opinions according to your own
and if they are for these measures
or any of them
i shall have nothing to oppose if they are not for them
i shall not
by any appliances whatever
attempt to dragoon them into their adoption
now can there be any difficulty in understanding this
to you democrats it may not seem like principle but surely you cannot fail to perceive the position plainly enough
the distinction between it and the position of your candidate is broad and obvious
and i admit you have a clear right to show it is wrong if you can but you have no right to pretend you cannot see it at all
we see it
and to us it appears like principle
and the best sort of principle at that the principle of allowing the people to do as they please with their own business
my friend from indiana c
smith has aptly asked
are you willing to trust the people
some of you answered substantially
we are willing to trust the people but the president is as much the representative of the people as congress
in a certain sense
and to a certain extent
he is the representative of the people
he is elected by them
as well as congress is but can he
in the nature of things know the wants of the people as well as three hundred other men
coming from all the various localities of the nation
if so
where is the propriety of having a congress
that the constitution gives the president a negative on legislation
all know but that this negative should be so combined with platforms and other appliances as to enable him
and in fact almost compel him
to take the whole of legislation into his own hands
is what we object to
is what general taylor objects to
and is what constitutes the broad distinction between you and us
to thus transfer legislation is clearly to take it from those who understand with minuteness the interests of the people
and give it to one who does not and cannot so well understand it
i understand your idea that if a presidential candidate avow his opinion upon a given question
or rather upon all questions
and the people
with full knowledge of this
elect him
they thereby distinctly approve all those opinions
by means of it
measures are adopted or rejected contrary to the wishes of the whole of one party
and often nearly half of the other
or half a dozen questions are prominent at a given time the party selects its candidate
and he takes his position on each of these questions
on all but one his positions have already been indorsed at former elections
and his party fully committed to them but that one is new
and a large portion of them are against it
but what are they to do
the whole was strung together and they must take all
or reject all
they cannot take what they like
and leave the rest
what they are already committed to being the majority
they shut their eyes
and gulp the whole
next election
still another is introduced in the same way
if we run our eyes along the line of the past
we shall see that almost if not quite all the articles of the present democratic creed have been at first forced upon the party in this very way
and just now
and just so
opposition to internal improvements is to be established if general cass shall be elected
almost half the democrats here are for improvements but they will vote for cass
and if he succeeds
their vote will have aided in closing the doors against improvements
now this is a process which we think is wrong
we prefer a candidate who
like general taylor
will allow the people to have their own way
regardless of his private opinions and i should think the internal improvement democrats
at least
ought to prefer such a candidate
he would force nothing on them which they don't want
and he would allow them to have improvements which their own candidate
if elected
will not
i have said general taylor's position is as well defined as is that of general cass
in saying this
i admit i do not certainly know what he would do on the wilmot proviso
i am a northern man or rather a western free state man
with a constituency i believe to be
and with personal feelings i know to be
against the extension of slavery
as such
and with what information i have
i hope and believe general taylor
if elected
would not veto the proviso
but i do not know it
yet if i knew he would
i still would vote for him
i should do so because
in my judgment
his election alone can defeat general cass and because
should slavery thereby go to the territory we now have
just so much will certainly happen by the election of cass
and in addition a course of policy leading to new wars
new acquisitions of territory and still further extensions of slavery
one of the two is to be president
which is preferable
but there is as much doubt of cass on improvements as there is of taylor on the proviso
i have no doubt myself of general cass on this question but i know the democrats differ among themselves as to his position
my internal improvement colleague mr
wentworth stated on this floor the other day that he was satisfied cass was for improvements
because he had voted for all the bills that he mr
wentworth had
so far so good
but mr
polk vetoed some of these very bills
the baltimore convention passed a set of resolutions
among other things
approving these vetoes
and general cass declares
in his letter accepting the nomination
that he has carefully read these resolutions
and that he adheres to them as firmly as he approves them cordially
in other words
general cass voted for the bills
and thinks the president did right to veto them and his friends here are amiable enough to consider him as being on one side or the other
just as one or the other may correspond with their own respective inclinations
my colleague admits that the platform declares against the constitutionality of a general system of improvements
and that general cass indorses the platform but he still thinks general cass is in favor of some sort of improvements
what are they
as he is against general objects
those he is for must be particular and local
now this is taking the subject precisely by the wrong end
particularity expending the money of the whole people for an object which will benefit only a portion of them is the greatest real objection to improvements
and has been so held by general jackson
and all others
i believe
till now
but now
the objects most general nearest free from this objection are to be rejected
while those most liable to it are to be embraced
to return
i cannot help believing that general cass
when he wrote his letter of acceptance
well understood he was to be claimed by the advocates of both sides of this question
and that he then closed the door against all further expressions of opinion purposely to retain the benefits of that double position
his subsequent equivocation at cleveland
to my mind
proves such to have been the case
one word more
and i shall have done with this branch of the subject
you democrats
and your candidate
in the main are in favor of laying down in advance a platform a set of party positions as a unit
and then of forcing the people
by every sort of appliance
to ratify them
however unpalatable some of them may be
we and our candidate are in favor of making presidential elections and the legislation of the country distinct matters so that the people can elect whom they please
and afterward legislate just as they please
without any hindrance
save only so much as may guard against infractions of the constitution
undue haste
and want of consideration
the difference between us is clear as noonday
that we are right we cannot doubt
we hold the true republican position
in leaving the people's business in their hands
we cannot be wrong
we are willing
and even anxious
to go to the people on this issue
but i suppose i cannot reasonably hope to convince you that we have any principles
the most i can expect is to assure you that we think we have and are quite contented with them
the other day one of the gentlemen from georgia mr
an eloquent man
and a man of learning
so far as i can judge
not being learned myself
came down upon us astonishingly
he spoke in what the 'baltimore american' calls the scathing and withering style
at the end of his second severe flash i was struck blind
and found myself feeling with my fingers for an assurance of my continued existence
a little of the bone was left
and i gradually revived
he eulogized mr
clay in high and beautiful terms
and then declared that we had deserted all our principles
and had turned henry clay out
like an old horse
to root
this is terribly severe
it cannot be answered by argument at least i cannot so answer it
i merely wish to ask the gentleman if the whigs are the only party he can think of who sometimes turn old horses out to root
is not a certain martin van buren an old horse which your own party have turned out to root
and is he not rooting a little to your discomfort about now
but in not nominating mr
clay we deserted our principles
you say
in what
tell us
ye men of principle
what principle we violated
we say you did violate principle in discarding van buren
and we can tell you how
you violated the primary
the cardinal
the one great living principle of all democratic representative government the principle that the representative is bound to carry out the known will of his constituents
a large majority of the baltimore convention of 1844 were
by their constituents
instructed to procure van buren 's nomination if they could
in violation in utter glaring contempt of this
you rejected him rejected him
as the gentleman from new york mr
birdsall the other day expressly admitted
for availability that same general availability which you charge upon us
and daily chew over here
as something exceedingly odious and unprincipled
but the gentleman from georgia mr
iverson gave us a second speech yesterday
all well considered and put down in writing
in which van buren was scathed and withered a few for his present position and movements
i cannot remember the gentleman's precise language but i do remember he put van buren down
till he got him where he was finally to stink and rot
mr
it is no business or inclination of mine to defend martin van buren in the war of extermination now waging between him and his old admirers
i say
devil take the hindmost and the foremost
but there is no mistaking the origin of the breach and if the curse of stinking and rotting is to fall on the first and greatest violators of principle in the matter
i disinterestedly suggest that the gentleman from georgia and his present co workers are bound to take it upon themselves
but the gentleman from georgia further says we have deserted all our principles
and taken shelter under general taylor's military coat tail
and he seems to think this is exceedingly degrading
as his faith is
so be it unto him
but can he remember no other military coat tail under which a certain other party have been sheltering for near a quarter of a century
has he no acquaintance with the ample military coat tail of general jackson
does he not know that his own party have run the five last presidential races under that coat tail
and that they are now running the sixth under the same cover
that coat tail was used not only for general jackson himself
but has been clung to
with the grip of death
by every democratic candidate since
you have never ventured
and dare not now venture
from under it
your campaign papers have constantly been old hickories
with rude likenesses of the old general upon them hickory poles and hickory brooms your never ending emblems mr
polk himself was young hickory
or something so and even now your campaign paper here is proclaiming that cass and butler are of the true hickory stripe
now
you dare not give it up
like a horde of hungry ticks you have stuck to the tail of the hermitage lion to the end of his life and you are still sticking to it
and drawing a loathsome sustenance from it
after he is dead
a fellow once advertised that he had made a discovery by which he could make a new man out of an old one
and have enough of the stuff left to make a little yellow dog
just such a discovery has general jackson's popularity been to you
you not only twice made president of him out of it
but you have had enough of the stuff left to make presidents of several comparatively small men since and it is your chief reliance now to make still another
old horses and military coat tails
or tails of any sort
are not figures of speech such as i would be the first to introduce into discussions here but as the gentleman from georgia has thought fit to introduce them
he and you are welcome to all you have made
or can make by them
if you have any more old horses
trot them out any more tails
just cock them and come at us
i repeat
i would not introduce this mode of discussion here but i wish gentlemen on the other side to understand that the use of degrading figures is a game at which they may not find themselves able to take all the winnings
we give it up
aye
you give it up
and well you may but for a very different reason from that which you would have us understand
the point the power to hurt of all figures consists in the truthfulness of their application and
understanding this
you may well give it up
they are weapons which hit you
but miss us
but in my hurry i was very near closing this subject of military tails before i was done with it
there is one entire article of the sort i have not discussed yet
i mean the military tail you democrats are now engaged in dovetailing into the great michigander cass
sir all his biographies and they are legion have him in hand
tying him to a military tail
like so many mischievous boys tying a dog to a bladder of beans
the material they have is very limited
but they drive at it might and main
he invaded canada without resistance
and he outvaded it without pursuit
as he did both under orders
i suppose there was to him neither credit nor discredit in them but they constitute a large part of the tail
he was not at hull's surrender
but he was close by he was volunteer aid to general harrison on the day of the battle of the thames and as you said in 1840 harrison was picking huckleberries two miles off while the battle was fought
i suppose it is a just conclusion with you to say cass was aiding harrison to pick huckleberries
this is about all
except the mooted question of the broken sword
some authors say he broke it
some say he threw it away
and some others
who ought to know
say nothing about it
perhaps it would be a fair historical compromise to say
if he did not break it
he did not do anything else with it
by the way
did you know i am a military hero
sir in the days of the black hawk war i fought
and came away
speaking of general cass's career reminds me of my own
i was not at stiliman's defeat
but i was about as near it as cass was to hull's surrender and
like him
i saw the place very soon afterward
it is quite certain i did not break my sword
for i had none to break but i bent a musket pretty badly on one occasion
if cass broke his sword
the idea is he broke it in desperation i bent the musket by accident
if general cass went in advance of me in picking huckleberries
i guess i surpassed him in charges upon the wild onions
if he saw any live
fighting indians
it was more than i did but i had a good many bloody struggles with the mosquitoes
and although i never fainted from the loss of blood
i can truly say i was often very hungry
if i should ever conclude to doff whatever our democratic friends may suppose there is of black cockade federalism about me
and therefore they shall take me up as their candidate for the presidency
i protest they shall not make fun of me
as they have of general cass
by attempting to write me into a military hero
while i have general cass in hand
i wish to say a word about his political principles
as a specimen
i take the record of his progress in the wilmot proviso
in the washington union of march 2
there is a report of a speech of general cass
made the day before in the senate
on the wilmot proviso
during the delivery of which mr
miller of new jersey is reported to have interrupted him as follows
to wit
miller expressed his great surprise at the change in the sentiments of the senator from michigan
who had been regarded as the great champion of freedom in the northwest
of which he was a distinguished ornament
last year the senator from michigan was understood to be decidedly in favor of the wilmot proviso and as no reason had been stated for the change
he mr
miller could not refrain from the expression of his extreme surprise
to this general cass is reported to have replied as follows
to wit
cass said that the course of the senator from new jersey was most extraordinary
last year he mr
cass should have voted for the proposition
had it come up
but circumstances had altogether changed
the honorable senator then read several passages from the remarks
as given above
which he had committed to writing
in order to refute such a charge as that of the senator from new jersey
in the remarks above reduced to writing is one numbered four
as follows
to wit
legislation now would be wholly inoperative
because no territory hereafter to be acquired can be governed without an act of congress providing for its government and such an act
on its passage
would open the whole subject
and leave the congress called on to pass it free to exercise its own discretion
entirely uncontrolled by any declaration found on the statute book
in niles's register
there is a letter of general cass to nicholson
of nashville
dated december 24
from which the following are correct extracts
the wilmot proviso has been before the country some time
it has been repeatedly discussed in congress and by the public press
i am strongly impressed with the opinion that a great change has been going on in the public mind upon this subject
in my own as well as others
and that doubts are resolving themselves into convictions that the principle it involves should be kept out of the national legislature
and left to the people of the confederacy in their respective local governments
i am opposed to the exercise of any jurisdiction by congress over this matter and i am in favor of leaving the people of any territory which may be hereafter acquired the right to regulate it themselves
under the general principles of the constitution
i do not see in the constitution any grant of the requisite power to congress and i am not disposed to extend a doubtful precedent beyond its necessity
the establishment of territorial governments when needed
leaving to the inhabitants all the right compatible with the relations they bear to the confederation
these extracts show that in 1846 general cass was for the proviso at once that in march
he was still for it
but not just then and that in december
he was against it altogether
this is a true index to the whole man
when the question was raised in 1846
he was in a blustering hurry to take ground for it
he sought to be in advance
and to avoid the uninteresting position of a mere follower but soon he began to see glimpses of the great democratic ox goad waving in his face
and to hear indistinctly a voice saying
back a little
he shakes his head
and bats his eyes
and blunders back to his position of march
1847 but still the goad waves
and the voice grows more distinct and sharper still
i say
further back
and back he goes to the position of december
at which the goad is still
and the voice soothingly says
stand at that
have no fears
of your candidate
he exactly suits you
and we congratulate you upon it
however much you may be distressed about our candidate
you have all cause to be contented and happy with your own
if elected
he may not maintain all or even any of his positions previously taken but he will be sure to do whatever the party exigency for the time being may require and that is precisely what you want
he and van buren are the same manner of men and
like van buren
he will never desert you till you first desert him
i adopt the suggestion of a friend
that general cass is a general of splendidly successful charges charges
to be sure
not upon the public enemy
but upon the public treasury
he was governor of michigan territory
and ex officio superintendent of indian affairs
from the 9th of october
till the 31st of july
1831 a period of seventeen years
nine months
and twenty two days
during this period he received from the united states treasury
for personal services and personal expenses
the aggregate sum of ninety six thousand and twenty eight dollars
being an average of fourteen dollars and seventy nine cents per day for every day of the time
this large sum was reached by assuming that he was doing service at several different places
and in several different capacities in the same place
all at the same time
by a correct analysis of his accounts during that period
the following propositions may be deduced
he was paid in three different capacities during the whole of the time
that is to say 1 as governor a salary at the rate per year of 2000
2 as estimated for office rent
clerk hire
in superintendence of indian affairs in michigan
at the rate per year of 1500
3 as compensation and expenses for various miscellaneous items of indian service out of michigan
an average per year of 625
during part of the time that is
from the 9th of october
to the 29th of may
1822 he was paid in four different capacities that is to say
the three as above
in addition thereto
the commutation of ten rations per day
amounting per year to 730
during another part of the time that is
from the beginning of 1822 to the 31st of july
83 he was also paid in four different capacities that is to say
the first three
as above the rations being dropped after the 29th of may
in addition thereto
for superintending indian agencies at piqua
ohio fort wayne
indiana and chicago
at the rate per year of 1500
it should be observed here that the last item
commencing at the beginning of 1822
and the item of rations
ending on the 29th of may
lap on each other during so much of the time as lies between those two dates
still another part of the time that is
from the 31st of october
to the 29th of may
1822 he was paid in six different capacities that is to say
the three first
as above the item of rations
as above and
in addition thereto
another item of ten rations per day while at washington settling his accounts
being at the rate per year of 730 and also an allowance for expenses traveling to and from washington
and while there
of 1022
being at the rate per year of 1793
and yet during the little portion of the time which lies between the 1st of january
and the 29th of may
he was paid in seven different capacities that is to say
the six last mentioned
and also
at the rate of 1500 per year
for the piqua
fort wayne
and chicago service
as mentioned above
these accounts have already been discussed some here but when we are amongst them
as when we are in the patent office
we must peep about a good deal before we can see all the curiosities
i shall not be tedious with them
as to the large item of 1500 per year amounting in the aggregate to 26
715 for office rent
clerk hire
i barely wish to remark that
so far as i can discover in the public documents
there is no evidence
by word or inference
either from any disinterested witness or of general cass himself
that he ever rented or kept a separate office
ever hired or kept a clerk
or even used any extra amount of fuel
in consequence of his indian services
general cass's entire silence in regard to these items
in his two long letters urging his claims upon the government
to my mind
almost conclusive that no such claims had any real existence
but i have introduced general cass's accounts here chiefly to show the wonderful physical capacities of the man
they show that he not only did the labor of several men at the same time
but that he often did it at several places
many hundreds of miles apart
at the same time
and at eating
his capacities are shown to be quite as wonderful
from october
to may
he eat ten rations a day in michigan
ten rations a day here in washington
and near five dollars' worth a day on the road between the two places
and then there is an important discovery in his example the art of being paid for what one eats
instead of having to pay for it
hereafter if any nice young man should owe a bill which he cannot pay in any other way
he can just board it out
we have all heard of the animal standing in doubt between two stacks of hay and starving to death
the like of that would never happen to general cass
place the stacks a thousand miles apart
he would stand stock still midway between them
and eat them both at once
and the green grass along the line would be apt to suffer some
at the same time
by all means make him president
he will feed you bounteously if if there is any left after he shall have helped himself
as general taylor is
par excellence
the hero of the mexican war
and as you democrats say we whigs have always opposed the war
you think it must be very awkward and embarrassing for us to go for general taylor
the declaration that we have always opposed the war is true or false
according as one may understand the term oppose the war
if to say the war was unnecessarily and unconstitutionally commenced by the president by opposing the war
then the whigs have very generally opposed it
whenever they have spoken at all
they have said this and they have said it on what has appeared good reason to them
the marching an army into the midst of a peaceful mexican settlement
frightening the inhabitants away
leaving their growing crops and other property to destruction
to you may appear a perfectly amiable
unprovoking procedure but it does not appear so to us
so to call such an act
to us appears no other than a naked
impudent absurdity
and we speak of it accordingly
but if
when the war had begun
and had become the cause of the country
the giving of our money and our blood
in common with yours
was support of the war
then it is not true that we have always opposed the war
with few individual exceptions
you have constantly had our votes here for all the necessary supplies
more than this
you have had the services
the blood
and the lives of our political brethren in every trial and on every field
the beardless boy and the mature man
the humble and the distinguished you have had them
through suffering and death
by disease and in battle they have endured and fought and fell with you
clay and webster each gave a son
never to be returned
from the state of my own residence
besides other worthy but less known whig names
we sent marshall
and hardin they all fought
and one fell
and in the fall of that one we lost our best whig man
nor were the whigs few in number
or laggard in the day of danger
in that fearful
breathless struggle at buena vista
where each man's hard task was to beat back five foes or die himself
of the five high officers who perished
four were whigs
in speaking of this
i mean no odious comparison between the lion hearted whigs and the democrats who fought there
on other occasions
and among the lower officers and privates on that occasion
i doubt not the proportion was different
i wish to do justice to all
i think of all those brave men as americans
in whose proud fame
as an american
i too have a share
many of them
whigs and democrats are my constituents and personal friends and i thank them
more than thank them
one and all
for the high imperishable honor they have conferred on our common state
but the distinction between the cause of the president in beginning the war
and the cause of the country after it was begun
is a distinction which you cannot perceive
to you the president and the country seem to be all one
you are interested to see no distinction between them and i venture to suggest that probably your interest blinds you a little
we see the distinction
as we think
clearly enough and our friends who have fought in the war have no difficulty in seeing it also
what those who have fallen would say
were they alive and here
of course we can never know but with those who have returned there is no difficulty
colonel haskell and major gaines
members here
both fought in the war
and both of them underwent extraordinary perils and hardships still they
like all other whigs here
on the record
that the war was unnecessarily and unconstitutionally commenced by the president
and even general taylor himself
the noblest roman of them all
has declared that as a citizen
and particularly as a soldier
it is sufficient for him to know that his country is at war with a foreign nation
to do all in his power to bring it to a speedy and honorable termination by the most vigorous and energetic operations
without inquiry about its justice
or anything else connected with it
let our democratic friends be comforted with the assurance that we are content with our position
content with our company
and content with our candidate and that although they
in their generous sympathy
think we ought to be miserable
we really are not
and that they may dismiss the great anxiety they have on our account
i see i have but three minutes left
and this forces me to throw out one whole branch of my subject
a single word on still another
the democrats are keen enough to frequently remind us that we have some dissensions in our ranks
our good friend from baltimore immediately before me mr
mclane expressed some doubt the other day as to which branch of our party general taylor would ultimately fall into the hands of
that was a new idea to me
i knew we had dissenters
but i did not know they were trying to get our candidate away from us
i would like to say a word to our dissenters
but i have not the time
some such we certainly have have you none
gentlemen democrats
is it all union and harmony in your ranks
no bickerings
no divisions
if there be doubt as to which of our divisions will get our candidate
is there no doubt as to which of your candidates will get your party
i have heard some things from new york and if they are true
one might well say of your party there
as a drunken fellow once said when he heard the reading of an indictment for hog stealing
the clerk read on till he got to and through the words
did steal
and carry away ten boars
ten sows
ten shoats
and ten pigs
at which he exclaimed
by golly
that is the most equally divided gang of hogs i ever did hear of
if there is any other gang of hogs more equally divided than the democrats of new york are about this time
i have not heard of it
speech delivered at worcester
on sept
from the boston advertiser
mr
kellogg then introduced to the meeting the hon
abram lincoln
whig member of congress from illinois
a representative of free soil
lincoln has a very tall and thin figure
with an intellectual face
showing a searching mind
and a cool judgment
he spoke in a clear and cool and very eloquent manner
for an hour and a half
carrying the audience with him in his able arguments and brilliant illustrations only interrupted by warm and frequent applause
he began by expressing a real feeling of modesty in addressing an audience this side of the mountains
a part of the country where
in the opinion of the people of his section
everybody was supposed to be instructed and wise
but he had devoted his attention to the question of the coming presidential election
and was not unwilling to exchange with all whom he might the ideas to which he had arrived
he then began to show the fallacy of some of the arguments against gen
making his chief theme the fashionable statement of all those who oppose him the old locofocos as well as the new that he has no principles
and that the whig party have abandoned their principles by adopting him as their candidate
he maintained that gen
taylor occupied a high and unexceptionable whig ground
and took for his first instance and proof of this the statement in the allison letter with regard to the bank
rivers and harbors
that the will of the people should produce its own results
without executive influence
the principle that the people should do what under the constitution as they please
is a whig principle
all that gen
taylor is not only to consent to
but appeal to the people to judge and act for themselves
and this was no new doctrine for whigs
it was the platform on which they had fought all their battles
the resistance of executive influence
and the principle of enabling the people to frame the government according to their will
taylor consents to be the candidate
and to assist the people to do what they think to be their duty
and think to be best in their national affairs
but because he don't want to tell what we ought to do
he is accused of having no principles
the whigs here maintained for years that neither the influence
the duress
or the prohibition of the executive should control the legitimately expressed will of the people and now that
on that very ground
taylor says that he should use the power given him by the people to do
to the best of his judgment
the will of the people
he is accused of want of principle
and of inconsistency in position
lincoln proceeded to examine the absurdity of an attempt to make a platform or creed for a national party
to all parts of which all must consent and agree
when it was clearly the intention and the true philosophy of our government
that in congress all opinions and principles should be represented
and that when the wisdom of all had been compared and united
the will of the majority should be carried out
on this ground he conceived and the audience seemed to go with him that gen
taylor held correct
sound republican principles
lincoln then passed to the subject of slavery in the states
saying that the people of illinois agreed entirely with the people of massachusetts on this subject
except perhaps that they did not keep so constantly thinking about it
all agreed that slavery was an evil
but that we were not responsible for it and cannot affect it in states of this union where we do not live
but the question of the extension of slavery to new territories of this country is a part of our responsibility and care
and is under our control
in opposition to this mr
believed that the self named free soil party was far behind the whigs
both parties opposed the extension
as he understood it the new party had no principle except this opposition
if their platform held any other
it was in such a general way that it was like the pair of pantaloons the yankee pedlar offered for sale
large enough for any man
small enough for any boy
they therefore had taken a position calculated to break down their single important declared object
they were working for the election of either gen
cass or gen
the speaker then went on to show
clearly and eloquently
the danger of extension of slavery
likely to result from the election of gen
to unite with those who annexed the new territory to prevent the extension of slavery in that territory seemed to him to be in the highest degree absurd and ridiculous
suppose these gentlemen succeed in electing mr
van buren
they had no specific means to prevent the extension of slavery to new mexico and california
and gen
he confidently believed
would not encourage it
and would not prohibit its restriction
but if gen
cass was elected
he felt certain that the plans of farther extension of territory would be encouraged
and those of the extension of slavery would meet no check
the free soil mart in claiming that name indirectly attempts a deception
by implying that whigs were not free soil men
declaring that they would do their duty and leave the consequences to god merely gave an excuse for taking a course they were not able to maintain by a fair and full argument
to make this declaration did not show what their duty was
if it did we should have no use for judgment
we might as well be made without intellect and when divine or human law does not clearly point out what is our duty
we have no means of finding out what it is but by using our most intelligent judgment of the consequences
if there were divine law or human law for voting for martin van buren
or if a fair examination of the consequences and just reasoning would show that voting for him would bring about the ends they pretended to wish then he would give up the argument
but since there was no fixed law on the subject
and since the whole probable result of their action would be an assistance in electing gen
he must say that they were behind the whigs in their advocacy of the freedom of the soil
lincoln proceeded to rally the buffalo convention for forbearing to say anything after all the previous declarations of those members who were formerly whigs on the subject of the mexican war
because the van burens had been known to have supported it
he declared that of all the parties asking the confidence of the country
this new one had less of principle than any other
he wondered whether it was still the opinion of these free soil gentlemen
as declared in the whereas at buffalo
that the whig and democratic parties were both entirely dissolved and absorbed into their own body
had the vermont election given them any light
they had calculated on making as great an impression in that state as in any part of the union
and there their attempts had been wholly ineffectual
their failure was a greater success than they would find in any other part of the union
lincoln went on to say that he honestly believed that all those who wished to keep up the character of the union who did not believe in enlarging our field
but in keeping our fences where they are and cultivating our present possessions
making it a garden
improving the morals and education of the people
devoting the administrations to this purpose all real whigs
friends of good honest government the race was ours
he had opportunities of hearing from almost every part of the union from reliable sources and had not heard of a county in which we had not received accessions from other parties
if the true whigs come forward and join these new friends
they need not have a doubt
we had a candidate whose personal character and principles he had already described
whom he could not eulogize if he would
taylor had been constantly
quietly standing up
doing his duty and asking no praise or reward for it
he was and must be just the man to whom the interests
and prosperity of the country might be safely intrusted
he had never failed in anything he had undertaken
although many of his duties had been considered almost impossible
lincoln then went into a terse though rapid review of the origin of the mexican war and the connection of the administration and general taylor with it
from which he deduced a strong appeal to the whigs present to do their duty in the support of general taylor
and closed with the warmest aspirations for and confidence in a deserved success
at the close of his truly masterly and convincing speech
the audience gave three enthusiastic cheers for illinois
and three more for the eloquent whig member from the state
his father's request for money to thomas lincoln washington
my dear father
your letter of the 7th was received night before last
i very cheerfully send you the twenty dollars
which sum you say is necessary to save your land from sale
it is singular that you should have forgotten a judgment against you and it is more singular that the plaintiff should have let you forget it so long particularly as i suppose you always had property enough to satisfy a judgment of that amount
before you pay it
it would be well to be sure you have not paid
or at least
that you cannot prove you have paid it
give my love to mother and all the connections
affectionately your son
1849 bill to abolish slavery in the district of columbia resolved
that the committee on the district of columbia be instructed to report a bill in substance as follows

the secretary of state
and the secretary of the treasury shall be a board for determining the value of such slaves as their owners may desire to emancipate under this section

bill granting lands to the states to make railways and canals remarks in the house of representatives
february 13
lincoln said he had not risen for the purpose of making a speech
but only for the purpose of meeting some of the objections to the bill
if he understood those objections
the first was that if the bill were to become a law
it would be used to lock large portions of the public lands from sale
without at last effecting the ostensible object of the bill the construction of railroads in the new states and secondly
that congress would be forced to the abandonment of large portions of the public lands to the states for which they might be reserved
without their paying for them
this he understood to be the substance of the objections of the gentleman from ohio to the passage of the bill
if he could get the attention of the house for a few minutes
he would ask gentlemen to tell us what motive could induce any state legislature
or individual
or company of individuals
of the new states
to expend money in surveying roads which they might know they could not make
a voice
they are not required to make the road
mr
lincoln continued
that was not the case he was making
what motive would tempt any set of men to go into an extensive survey of a railroad which they did not intend to make
what good would it do
did men act without motive
did business men commonly go into an expenditure of money which could be of no account to them
he generally found that men who have money were disposed to hold on to it
unless they could see something to be made by its investment
he could not see what motive of advantage to the new states could be subserved by merely keeping the public lands out of market
and preventing their settlement
as far as he could see
the new states were wholly without any motive to do such a thing
he took to be a good answer to the first objection
in relation to the fact assumed
that after a while
the new states having got hold of the public lands to a certain extent
they would turn round and compel congress to relinquish all claim to them
he had a word to say
by way of recurring to the history of the past
when was the time to come he asked when the states in which the public lands were situated would compose a majority of the representation in congress
or anything like it
a majority of representatives would very soon reside west of the mountains
he admitted but would they all come from states in which the public lands were situated
they certainly would not for
as these western states grew strong in congress
the public lands passed away from them
and they got on the other side of the question and the gentleman from ohio mr
vinton was an example attesting that fact
vinton interrupted here to say that he had stood on this question just where he was now
for five and twenty years
lincoln was not making an argument for the purpose of convicting the gentleman of any impropriety at all
he was speaking of a fact in history
of which his state was an example
he was referring to a plain principle in the nature of things
the state of ohio had now grown to be a giant
she had a large delegation on that floor but was she now in favor of granting lands to the new states
as she used to be
the new england states
new york
and the old thirteen were all rather quiet upon the subject and it was seen just now that a member from one of the new states was the first man to rise up in opposition
and such would be with the history of this question for the future
there never would come a time when the people residing in the states embracing the public lands would have the entire control of this subject and so it was a matter of certainty that congress would never do more in this respect than what would be dictated by a just liberality
the apprehension
that the public lands were in danger of being wrested from the general government by the strength of the delegation in congress from the new states
was utterly futile
there never could be such a thing
if we take these lands said he it will not be without your consent
we can never outnumber you
the result is that all fear of the new states turning against the right of congress to the public domain must be effectually quelled
as those who are opposed to that interest must always hold a vast majority here
and they will never surrender the whole or any part of the public lands unless they themselves choose to do so
that was all he desired to say
on federal political appointments to the secretary of the treasury

dear sir
colonel r
baker and myself are the only whig members of congress from illinois of the thirtieth
and he of the thirty first
we have reason to think the whigs of that state hold us responsible
to some extent
for the appointments which may be made of our citizens
we do not know you personally
and our efforts to you have so far been unavailing
i therefore hope i am not obtrusive in saying in this way
for him and myself
that when a citizen of illinois is to be appointed in your department
to an office either in or out of the state
we most respectfully ask to be heard
your obedient servant
more political patronage requests to the secretary of state
march 10
secretary of state
there are several applicants for the office of united states marshal for the district of illinois
among the most prominent of them are benjamin bond
of carlyle
and thomas
of galena
bond i know to be personally every way worthy of the office and he is very numerously and most respectably recommended
his papers i send to you and i solicit for his claims a full and fair consideration
having said this much
i add that in my individual judgment the appointment of mr
thomas would be the better
your obedient servant
indorsed on mr
bond's papers
in this and the accompanying envelope are the recommendations of about two hundred good citizens of all parts of illinois
that benjamin bond be appointed marshal for that district
they include the names of nearly all our whigs who now are
or have ever been
members of the state legislature
besides forty six of the democratic members of the present legislature
and many other good citizens
i add that from personal knowledge i consider mr
bond every way worthy of the office
and qualified to fill it
holding the individual opinion that the appointment of a different gentleman would be better
i ask especial attention and consideration for his claims
and for the opinions expressed in his favor by those over whom i can claim no superiority

dear sir
i recommend that walter davis be appointed receiver of the land office at this place
whenever there shall be a vacancy
i cannot say that mr
the present incumbent
has failed in the proper discharge of any of the duties of the office
he is a very warm partisan
and openly and actively opposed to the election of general taylor
i also understand that since general taylor's election he has received a reappointment from mr
his old commission not having expired
whether this is true the records of the department will show
i may add that the whigs here almost universally desire his removal
i give no opinion of my own
but state the facts
and express the hope that the department will act in this as in all other cases on some proper general rule
your obedient servant
the land district to which this office belongs is very nearly if not entirely within my district so that colonel baker
the other whig representative
claims no voice in the appointment
to the secretary of the interior
april 7
secretary of the home department
dear sir
i recommend that turner r
now of pekin
be appointed register of the land office at this place whenever there shall be a vacancy
i do not know that mr
the present incumbent
has failed in the proper discharge of any of his duties in the office
he is a decided partisan
and openly and actively opposed the election of general taylor
i understand
that since the election of general taylor
barret has received a reappointment from mr
his old commission not having expired
whether this be true
the records of the department will show
whether he should be removed i give no opinion
but merely express the wish that the department may act upon some proper general rule
and that mr
barret's case may not be made an exception to it
your obedient servant
the land district to which this office belongs is very nearly if not entirely within my district so that colonel baker
the other whig representative
claims no voice in the appointment
to the postmaster general
april 7
dear sir
i recommend that abner y
ellis be appointed postmaster at this place
whenever there shall be a vacancy
the present incumbent
i cannot say has failed in the proper discharge of any of the duties of the office
has been an active partisan in opposition to us
located at the seat of government of the state
he has been
for part if not the whole of the time he has held the office
a member of the democratic state central committee
signing his name to their addresses and manifestoes and has been
as i understand
reappointed by mr
polk since general taylor's election
these are the facts of the case as i understand them
and i give no opinion of mine as to whether he should or should not be removed
my wish is that the department may adopt some proper general rule for such cases
and that mr
diller may not be made an exception to it
one way or the other
your obedient servant
this office
with its delivery
is entirely within my district so that colonel baker
the other whig representative
claims no voice in the appointment
to the secretary of the interior
april 7
secretary of the home department
dear sir
i recommend that william butler be appointed pension agent for the illinois agency
when the place shall be vacant
the present incumbent
i believe has performed the duties very well
he is a decided partisan
and i believe expects to be removed
whether he shall
i submit to the department
this office is not confined to my district
but pertains to the whole state so that colonel baker has an equal right with myself to be heard concerning it
the office is located here and i think it is not probable that any one would desire to remove from a distance to take it
your obedient servant

april 25
dear thompson
a tirade is still kept up against me here for recommending t
this morning it is openly avowed that my supposed influence at washington shall be broken down generally
and king's prospects defeated in particular
what i have done in this matter i have done at the request of you and some other friends in tazewell and i therefore ask you to either admit it is wrong or come forward and sustain me
if the truth will permit
i propose that you sustain me in the following manner
copy the inclosed scrap in your own handwriting and get everybody not three or four
but three or four hundred to sign it
and then send it to me
have six
eight or ten of our best known whig friends there write to me individual letters
stating the truth in this matter as they understand it
don't neglect or delay in the matter
i understand information of an indictment having been found against him about three years ago
for gaming or keeping a gaming house
has been sent to the department
i shall try to take care of it at the department till your action can be had and forwarded on
yours as ever
to the secretary of the interior
springfield illinois
may 10
secretary of the interior
dear sir
i regret troubling you so often in relation to the land offices here
but i hope you will perceive the necessity of it
and excuse me
on the 7th of april i wrote you recommending turner r
king for register
and walter davis for receiver
subsequently i wrote you that
for a private reason
i had concluded to transpose them
that private reason was the request of an old personal friend who himself desired to be receiver
but whom i felt it my duty to refuse a recommendation
he said if i would transpose king and davis he would be satisfied
i thought it a whim
anxious to oblige him
i consented
immediately he commenced an assault upon king's character
as i suppose
to defeat his appointment
and thereby secure another chance for himself
this double offence of bad faith to me and slander upon a good man is so totally outrageous that i now ask to have king and davis placed as i originally recommended
that is
king for register and davis for receiver
an effort is being made now to have mr
the present register
i have already said he has done the duties of the office well
and i now add he is a gentleman in the true sense
he submits to be the instrument of his party to injure us
his high character enables him to do it more effectually
last year he presided at the convention which nominated the democratic candidate for congress in this district
and afterward ran for the state senate himself
not desiring the seat
but avowedly to aid and strengthen his party
he made speech after speech with a degree of fierceness and coarseness against general taylor not quite consistent with his habitually gentlemanly deportment
at least one and i think more of those who are now trying to have him retained was himself an applicant for this very office
failing to get my recommendation
now takes this turn
in writing you a third time in relation to these offices
i stated that i supposed charges had been forwarded to you against king
and that i would inquire into the truth of them
i now send you herewith what i suppose will be an ample defense against any such charges
i ask attention to all the papers
but particularly to the letters of mr
david mack
and the paper with the long list of names
there is no mistake about king's being a good man
after the unjust assault upon him
and considering the just claims of tazewell county
as indicated in the letters i inclose you
it would in my opinion be injustice
and withal a blunder
not to appoint him
at least as soon as any one is appointed to either of the offices here
your obedient servant

dear gillespie
butterfield will be commissioner of the gen'l land office
unless prevented by strong and speedy efforts
ewing is for him
and he is only not appointed yet because old zach
hangs fire
i have reliable information of this
if you agree with me that this appointment would dissatisfy rather than gratify the whigs of this state
that it would slacken their energies in future contests
that his appointment in '41 is an old sore with them which they will not patiently have reopened
in a word that his appointment now would be a fatal blunder to the administration and our political men here in illinois
write crittenden to that effect
he can control the matter
were you to write ewing i fear the president would never hear of your letter
this may be mere suspicion
you might write directly to old zach
you will be the best judge of the propriety of that
not a moment's time is to be lost
let this be confidential except with mr
edwards and a few others whom you know i would trust just as i do you
yours as ever

confidential springfield
may 25
embree dear sir
i am about to ask a favor of you
one which i hope will not cost you much
i understand the general land office is about to be given to illinois
and that mr
ewing desires justin butterfield
of chicago
to be the man
i give you my word
the appointment of mr
butterfield will be an egregious political blunder
it will give offence to the whole whig party here
and be worse than a dead loss to the administration of so much of its patronage
if you can conscientiously do so
i wish you to write general taylor at once
saying that either i or the man i recommend should in your opinion be appointed to that office
if any one from illinois shall be
i restrict my request to illinois because you may have a man from your own state
and i do not ask to interfere with that

request for a patent improved method of lifting vessels over shoals
application for patent
what i claim as my invention
and desire to secure by letters patent
is the combination of expansible buoyant chambers placed at the sides of a vessel with the main shaft or shafts by means of the sliding spars
which pass down through the buoyant chambers and are made fast to their bottoms and the series of ropes and pulleys or their equivalents in such a manner that by turning the main shaft or shafts in one direction the buoyant chambers will be forced downward into the water
and at the same time expanded and filled with air for buoying up the vessel by the displacement of water
and by turning the shafts in an opposite direction the buoyant chambers will be contracted into a small space and secured against injury

dear sir
the receiver's office at which place is the subject of the within
is not in my district and i have been much perplexed to express any preference between dr
stapp and mr
if any one man is better qualified for such an office than all others
stapp is that man still
i believe a large majority of the whigs of the district prefer mr
who also is a good man
perhaps the papers on file will enable you to judge better than i can
the writers of the within are good men

dear william
your two letters were received last night
i have a great many letters to write
and so cannot write very long ones
there must be some mistake about walter davis saying i promised him the post office
i did not so promise him
i did tell him that if the distribution of the offices should fall into my hands
he should have something and if i shall be convinced he has said any more than this
i shall be disappointed
i said this much to him because
as i understand
he is of good character
is one of the young men
is of the mechanics
and always faithful and never troublesome a whig
and is poor
with the support of a widow mother thrown almost exclusively on him by the death of his brother
if these are wrong reasons
then i have been wrong but i have certainly not been selfish in it
because in my greatest need of friends he was against me
and for baker
yours as ever
let the above be confidential
to j
dear gillespie
edwards is unquestionably offended with me in connection with the matter of the general land office
he wrote a letter against me which was filed at the department
the better part of one's life consists of his friendships and
of them
mine with mr
edwards was one of the most cherished
i have not been false to it
at a word i could have had the office any time before the department was committed to mr
at least mr
ewing and the president say as much
that word i forbore to speak
partly for other reasons
but chiefly for mr
edwards' sake
losing the office that he might gain it i was always for but to lose his friendship
by the effort for him
would oppress me very much
were i not sustained by the utmost consciousness of rectitude
i first determined to be an applicant
on the 2nd of june and i did so then upon being informed by a telegraphic despatch that the question was narrowed down to mr
b and myself
and that the cabinet had postponed the appointment three weeks
for my benefit
not doubting that mr
edwards was wholly out of the question i
would not then have become an applicant had i supposed he would thereby be brought to suspect me of treachery to him
two or three days afterwards a conversation with levi davis convinced me mr
edwards was dissatisfied but i was then too far in to get out
his own letter
written on the 25th of april
after i had fully informed him of all that had passed
up to within a few days of that time
gave assurance i had that entire confidence from him which i felt my uniform and strong friendship for him entitled me to
among other things it says
whatever course your judgment may dictate as proper to be pursued
shall never be excepted to by me
i also had had a letter from washington
saying chambers
of the republic
had brought a rumor then
that mr
e had declined in my favor
which rumor i judged came from mr
e himself
as i had not then breathed of his letter to any living creature
in saying i had never
before the 2nd of june
determined to be an applicant
i mean to admit that
before then
i had said substantially i would take the office rather than it should be lost to the state
or given to one in the state whom the whigs did not want but i aver that in every instance in which i spoke of myself
i intended to keep
and now believe i did keep
e above myself
edwards' first suspicion was that i had allowed baker to overreach me
as his friend
in behalf of don morrison
i knew this was a mistake and the result has proved it
i understand his view now is
that if i had gone to open war with baker i could have ridden him down
and had the thing all my own way
i believe no such thing
with baker and some strong man from the military tract elsewhere for morrison
and we and some strong man from the wabash elsewhere for mr
it was not possible for either to succeed
i believed this in march
and i know it now
the only thing which gave either any chance was the very thing baker i proposed
an adjustment with themselves
you may wish to know how butterfield finally beat me
i can not tell you particulars now
but will when i see you
in the meantime let it be understood i am not greatly dissatisfied
i wish the offer had been so bestowed as to encourage our friends in future contests
and i regret exceedingly mr
edwards' feelings towards me
these two things away
i should have no regrets
at least i think i would not
write me soon

resolutions of sympathy with the cause of hungarian freedom
september 1
at a meeting to express sympathy with the cause of hungarian freedom
and wm
carpenter were appointed a committee to present appropriate resolutions
which reported through hon
lincoln the following
in their present glorious struggle for liberty
the hungarians command our highest admiration and have our warmest sympathy
that they have our most ardent prayers for their speedy triumph and final success
that the government of the united states should acknowledge the independence of hungary as a nation of freemen at the very earliest moment consistent with our amicable relations with the government against which they are contending
in the opinion of this meeting
the immediate acknowledgment of the independence of hungary by our government is due from american freemen to their struggling brethren
to the general cause of republican liberty
and not violative of the just rights of any nation or people

dear doctor
your letter of the 9th was received a day or two ago
the notes and mortgages you enclosed me were duly received
i also got the original blanchard mortgage from antrim campbell
with whom blanchard had left it for you
i got a decree of foreclosure on the whole but
owing to there being no redemption on the sale to be under the blanchard mortgage
the court allowed mobley till the first of march to pay the money
before advertising for sale
stuart was empowered by mobley to appear for him
and i had to take such decree as he would consent to
or none at all
i cast the matter about in my mind and concluded that as i could not get a decree we would put the accrued interest at interest
and thereby more than match the fact of throwing the blanchard debt back from twelve to six per cent
it was better to do it
this is the present state of the case
i can well enough understand and appreciate your suggestions about the land office at danville but in my present condition
i can do nothing
as ever

dear sir
on my return from kentucky i found your letter of the 7th of november
and have delayed answering it till now for the reason i now briefly state
from the beginning of our acquaintance i had felt the greatest kindness for you and had supposed it was reciprocated on your part
last summer
under circumstances which i mentioned to you
i was painfully constrained to withhold a recommendation which you desired
and shortly afterwards i learned
in such a way as to believe it
that you were indulging in open abuse of me
of course my feelings were wounded
on receiving your last letter the question occurred whether you were attempting to use me at the same time you would injure me
or whether you might not have been misrepresented to me
if the former
i ought not to answer you if the latter
i ought
and so i have remained in suspense
i now enclose you the letter
which you may use if you see fit

notes for law lecture fragments july 1
1850 discourage litigation
persuade your neighbors to compromise whenever you can
point out to them how the nominal winner is often a real loser in fees
and waste of time
as a peace maker the lawyer has a superior opportunity of being a good man
there will still be business enough
never stir up litigation
a worse man can scarcely be found than one who does this
who can be more nearly a fiend than he who habitually over hauls the register of deeds in search of defects in titles
whereon to stir up strife
and put money in his pocket
a moral tone ought to be infused into the profession which should drive such men out of it
the matter of fees is important
far beyond the mere question of bread and butter involved
properly attended to
fuller justice is done to both lawyer and client
an exorbitant fee should never be claimed
as a general rule never take your whole fee in advance
nor any more than a small retainer
when fully paid beforehand
you are more than a common mortal if you can feel the same interest in the case as if something was still in prospect for you
as well as for your client
and when you lack interest in the case the job will very likely lack skill and diligence in the performance
settle the amount of fee and take a note in advance
then you will feel that you are working for something
and you are sure to do your work faithfully and well
never sell a fee note at least not before the consideration service is performed
it leads to negligence and dishonesty negligence by losing interest in the case
and dishonesty in refusing to refund when you have allowed the consideration to fail
this idea of a refund or reduction of charges from the lawyer in a failed case is a new one to me but not a bad one
1851 letters to family members to john d
january 2
1851 dear johnston
your request for eighty dollars i do not think it best to comply with now
at the various times when i have helped you a little you have said to me
we can get along very well now but in a very short time i find you in the same difficulty again
this can only happen by some defect in your conduct
what that defect is
i think i know
you are not lazy
and still you are an idler
i doubt whether
since i saw you
you have done a good whole day's work in any one day
you do not very much dislike to work
and still you do not work much merely because it does not seem to you that you could get much for it
this habit of uselessly wasting time is the whole difficulty it is vastly important to you
and still more so to your children
that you should break the habit
it is more important to them
because they have longer to live
and can keep out of an idle habit before they are in it
easier than they can get out after they are in
you are now in need of some money and what i propose is
that you shall go to work
tooth and nail
for somebody who will give you money for it
let father and your boys take charge of your things at home
prepare for a crop
and make the crop
and you go to work for the best money wages
or in discharge of any debt you owe
that you can get and
to secure you a fair reward for your labor
i now promise you
that for every dollar you will
between this and the first of may
get for your own labor
either in money or as your own indebtedness
i will then give you one other dollar
by this
if you hire yourself at ten dollars a month
from me you will get ten more
making twenty dollars a month for your work
in this i do not mean you shall go off to st
or the lead mines
or the gold mines in california
but i mean for you to go at it for the best wages you can get close to home in coles county
if you will do this
you will be soon out of debt
what is better
you will have a habit that will keep you from getting in debt again
if i should now clear you out of debt
next year you would be just as deep in as ever
you say you would almost give your place in heaven for seventy or eighty dollars
then you value your place in heaven very cheap
for i am sure you can
with the offer i make
get the seventy or eighty dollars for four or five months' work
you say if i will furnish you the money you will deed me the land
if you don't pay the money back
you will deliver possession
if you can't now live with the land
how will you then live without it
you have always been kind to me
and i do not mean to be unkind to you
on the contrary
if you will but follow my advice
you will find it worth more than eighty times eighty dollars to you
affectionately your brother
to c
my dear sir
our case is decided against us
the decision was announced this morning
very sorry
but there is no help
the history of the case since it came here is this
on friday morning last
joy filed his papers
and entered his motion for a mandamus
and urged me to take up the motion as soon as possible
i already had the points and authority sent me by you and by mr
but had not studied them
i began preparing as fast as possible
the evening of the same day i was again urged to take up the case
i refused on the ground that i was not ready
and on which plea i also got off over saturday
but on monday the 14th i had to go into it
we occupied the whole day
i using the large part
i made every point and used every authority sent me by yourself and by mr
goodrich and in addition all the points i could think of and all the authorities i could find myself
when i closed the argument on my part
a large package was handed me
which proved to be the plat you sent me
the court received it of me
but it was not different from the plat already on the record
i do not think i could ever have argued the case better than i did
i did nothing else
but prepare to argue and argue this case
from friday morning till monday evening
very sorry for the result but i do not think it could have been prevented
your friend
as ever
to john d
january 12
1851 dear brother
on the day before yesterday i received a letter from harriet
written at greenup
she says she has just returned from your house
and that father is very low and will hardly recover
she also says you have written me two letters
and that
although you do not expect me to come now
you wonder that i do not write
i received both your letters
and although i have not answered them it is not because i have forgotten them
or been uninterested about them
but because it appeared to me that i could write nothing which would do any good
you already know i desire that neither father nor mother shall be in want of any comfort
either in health or sickness
while they live and i feel sure you have not failed to use my name
if necessary
to procure a doctor
or anything else for father in his present sickness
my business is such that i could hardly leave home now
if it was not as it is
that my own wife is sick abed
it is a case of baby sickness
and i suppose is not dangerous
i sincerely hope father may recover his health
but at all events
tell him to remember to call upon and confide in our great and good and merciful maker
who will not turn away from him in any extremity
he notes the fall of a sparrow
and numbers the hairs of our heads
and he will not forget the dying man who puts his trust in him
say to him that if we could meet now it is doubtful whether it would not be more painful than pleasant
but that if it be his lot to go now
he will soon have a joyous meeting with many loved ones gone before
and where the rest of us
through the help of god
hope ere long to join them
write to me again when you receive this
petition on behalf of one joshua gipson to the judge of the sangamon county court
may 13
to the honorable
the judge of the county court in and for the county of sangamon and state of illinois
your petitioner
joshua gipson
respectfully represents that on or about the 21st day of december
a judgment was rendered against your petitioner for costs
by j
one of the justices of the peace in and for said county of sangamon
in a suit wherein your petitioner was plaintiff and james l
and c
gerard were defendants that said judgment was not the result of negligence on the part of your petitioner that said judgment
in his opinion
is unjust and erroneous in this
that the defendants were at that time and are indebted to this petitioner in the full amount of the principal and interest of the note sued on
the principal being
as affiant remembers and believes
thirty one dollars and eighty two cents and that
as affiant is informed and believes
the defendants succeeded in the trial of said cause by proving old claims against your petitioner
in set off against said note
which claims had been settled
adjusted and paid before said note was executed
your petitioner further states that the reasons of his not being present at said trial
as he was not
and of its not being in his power to take an appeal in the ordinary way
as it was not
were that your petitioner then resided in edgar county about one hundred and twenty miles from where defendants resided that a very short time before the suit was commenced your petitioner was in sangamon county for the purpose of collecting debts due him
and with the rest
the note in question
which note had then been given more than a year
that your petitioner then saw the defendant j
gerard who is the principal in said note
and solicited payment of the same that said defendant then made no pretense that he did not owe the same
but on the contrary expressly promised that he would come into springfield
in a very few days and either pay the money
or give a new note
payable by the then next christmas that your petitioner accordingly left said note with said j
with directions to give defendant full time to pay the money or give the new note as above
and if he did neither to sue and then affiant came home to edgar county
not having the slightest suspicion that if suit should be brought
the defendants would make any defense whatever and your petitioner never did in any way learn that said suit had been commenced until more than twenty days after it had been decided against him
he therefore prays for a writ of certiorari
his joshua x gipson mark to j
1851 dear brother
inclosed is the deed for the land
we are all well
and have nothing in the way of news
we have had no cholera here for about two weeks
give my love to all
and especially to mother
yours as ever
to j
1851 dear brother
when i came into charleston day before yesterday i learned that you are anxious to sell the land where you live
and move to missouri
i have been thinking of this ever since
and cannot but think such a notion is utterly foolish
what can you do in missouri better than here
is the land richer
can you there
any more than here
raise corn and wheat and oats without work
will anybody there
any more than here
do your work for you
if you intend to go to work
there is no better place than right where you are if you do not intend to go to work you cannot get along anywhere
squirming and crawling about from place to place can do no good
you have raised no crop this year
and what you really want is to sell the land
get the money and spend it
part with the land you have
my life upon it
you will never after own a spot big enough to bury you in
half you will get for the land you spend in moving to missouri
and the other half you will eat and drink and wear out
and no foot of land will be bought
now i feel it is my duty to have no hand in such a piece of foolery
i feel that it is so even on your own account
and particularly on mother's account
the eastern forty acres i intend to keep for mother while she lives if you will not cultivate it
it will rent for enough to support her at least it will rent for something
her dower in the other two forties she can let you have
and no thanks to me
now do not misunderstand this letter
i do not write it in any unkindness
i write it in order
if possible
to get you to face the truth
which truth is
you are destitute because you have idled away all your time
your thousand pretenses for not getting along better are all nonsense they deceive nobody but yourself
go to work is the only cure for your case
a word for mother
chapman tells me he wants you to go and live with him
if i were you i would try it awhile
if you get tired of it as i think you will not you can return to your own home
chapman feels very kindly to you and i have no doubt he will make your situation very pleasant
sincerely yours
1851 dear mother
chapman tells me he wants you to go and live with him
if i were you i would try it awhile
if you get tired of it as i think you will not you can return to your own home
chapman feels very kindly to you and i have no doubt he will make your situation very pleasant
sincerely your son
to john d
november 9
1851 dear brother
when i wrote you before
i had not received your letter
i still think as i did
but if the land can be sold so that i get three hundred dollars to put to interest for mother
i will not object
if she does not
but before i will make a deed
the money must be had
or secured beyond all doubt
at ten per cent
as to abram
i do not want him
on my own account but i understand he wants to live with me
so that he can go to school and get a fair start in the world
which i very much wish him to have
when i reach home
if i can make it convenient to take
i will take him
provided there is no mistake between us as to the object and terms of my taking him
in haste
as ever
to john d
november 25
dear brother
your letter of the 22d is just received
your proposal about selling the east forty acres of land is all that i want or could claim for myself but i am not satisfied with it on mother's account i want her to have her living
and i feel that it is my duty
to some extent
to see that she is not wronged
she had a right of dower that is
the use of one third for life in the other two forties but
it seems
she has already let you take that
hook and line
she now has the use of the whole of the east forty
as long as she lives and if it be sold
of course she is entitled to the interest on all the money it brings
as long as she lives but you propose to sell it for three hundred dollars
take one hundred away with you
and leave her two hundred at 8 per cent
making her the enormous sum of 16 dollars a year
if you are satisfied with treating her in that way
i am not
it is true that you are to have that forty for two hundred dollars
at mother's death
but you are not to have it before
i am confident that land can be made to produce for mother at least 30 a year
and i can not
to oblige any living person
consent that she shall be put on an allowance of sixteen dollars a year
1852 eulogy on henry clay
delivered in the state house at springfield
july 16
on the fourth day of july
the people of a few feeble and oppressed colonies of great britain
inhabiting a portion of the atlantic coast of north america
publicly declared their national independence
and made their appeal to the justice of their cause and to the god of battles for the maintenance of that declaration
that people were few in number and without resources
save only their wise heads and stout hearts
within the first year of that declared independence
and while its maintenance was yet problematical
while the bloody struggle between those resolute rebels and their haughty would be masters was still waging
of undistinguished parents and in an obscure district of one of those colonies henry clay was born
the infant nation and the infant child began the race of life together
for three quarters of a century they have travelled hand in hand
they have been companions ever
the nation has passed its perils
and it is free
and powerful
the child has reached his manhood
his middle age
his old age
and is dead
in all that has concerned the nation the man ever sympathized and now the nation mourns the man
the day after his death one of the public journals
opposed to him politically
held the following pathetic and beautiful language
which i adopt partly because such high and exclusive eulogy
originating with a political friend
might offend good taste
but chiefly because i could not in any language of my own so well express my thoughts
who can realize that henry clay is dead
who can realize that never again that majestic form shall rise in the council chambers of his country to beat back the storms of anarchy which may threaten
or pour the oil of peace upon the troubled billows as they rage and menace around
who can realize that the workings of that mighty mind have ceased
that the throbbings of that gallant heart are stilled
that the mighty sweep of that graceful arm will be felt no more
and the magic of that eloquent tongue
which spake as spake no other tongue besides
is hushed hushed for ever
who can realize that freedom's champion
the champion of a civilized world and of all tongues and kindreds of people
has indeed fallen
in those dark hours of peril and dread which our land has experienced
and which she may be called to experience again
to whom now may her people look up for that counsel and advice which only wisdom and experience and patriotism can give
and which only the undoubting confidence of a nation will receive
perchance in the whole circle of the great and gifted of our land there remains but one on whose shoulders the mighty mantle of the departed statesman may fall one who while we now write is doubtless pouring his tears over the bier of his brother and friend brother
yet in political sentiment as far apart as party could make them
it is at times like these that the petty distinctions of mere party disappear
we see only the great
the grand
the noble features of the departed statesman and we do not even beg permission to bow at his feet and mingle our tears with those who have ever been his political adherents we do not beg this permission
we claim it as a right
though we feel it as a privilege
henry clay belonged to his country to the world mere party cannot claim men like him
his career has been national
his fame has filled the earth
his memory will endure to the last syllable of recorded time
henry clay is dead
he breathed his last on yesterday
at twenty minutes after eleven
in his chamber at washington
to those who followed his lead in public affairs
it more appropriately belongs to pronounce his eulogy and pay specific honors to the memory of the illustrious dead
but all americans may show the grief which his death inspires
for his character and fame are national property
as on a question of liberty he knew no north
no south
no east
no west
but only the union which held them all in its sacred circle
so now his countrymen will know no grief that is not as wide spread as the bounds of the confederacy
the career of henry clay was a public career
from his youth he has been devoted to the public service
at a period
in the world's history justly regarded as a remarkable era in human affairs
he witnessed in the beginning the throes of the french revolution
he saw the rise and fall of napoleon
he was called upon to legislate for america and direct her policy when all europe was the battlefield of contending dynasties
and when the struggle for supremacy imperilled the rights of all neutral nations
his voice spoke war and peace in the contest with great britain
when greece rose against the turks and struck for liberty
his name was mingled with the battle cry of freedom
when south america threw off the thraldom of spain
his speeches were read at the head of her armies by bolivar
his name has been
and will continue to be
hallowed in two hemispheres
for it is 'one of the few
the immortal names that were not born to die
 to the ardent patriot and profound statesman he added a quality possessed by few of the gifted on earth
his eloquence has not been surpassed
in the effective power to move the heart of man
clay was without an equal
and the heaven born endowment
in the spirit of its origin
has been most conspicuously exhibited against intestine feud
on at least three important occasions he has quelled our civil commotions by a power and influence which belonged to no other statesman of his age and times
and in our last internal discord
when this union trembled to its centre
in old age he left the shades of private life
and gave the death blow to fraternal strife
with the vigor of his earlier years
in a series of senatorial efforts which in themselves would bring immortality by challenging comparison with the efforts of any statesman in any age
he exorcised the demon which possessed the body politic
and gave peace to a distracted land
the achievement cost him his life
he sank day by day to the tomb his pale but noble brow bound with a triple wreath
put there by a grateful country
may his ashes rest in peace
while his spirit goes to take its station among the great and good men who preceded him
while it is customary and proper upon occasions like the present to give a brief sketch of the life of the deceased
in the case of mr
clay it is less necessary than most others for his biography has been written and rewritten and read and reread for the last twenty five years so that
with the exception of a few of the latest incidents of his life
all is as well known as it can be
the short sketch which i give is
merely to maintain the connection of this discourse
henry clay was born on the twelfth day of april
in hanover county
of his father
who died in the fourth or fifth year of henry's age
little seems to be known
except that he was a respectable man and a preacher of the baptist persuasion
clay's education to the end of life was comparatively limited
i say to the end of life
because i have understood that from time to time he added something to his education during the greater part of his whole life
clay's lack of a more perfect early education
however it may be regretted generally
teaches at least one profitable lesson
it teaches that in this country one can scarcely be so poor but that
if he will
he can acquire sufficient education to get through the world respectably
in his twenty third year mr
clay was licensed to practise law
and emigrated to lexington
here he commenced and continued the practice till the year 1803
when he was first elected to the kentucky legislature
by successive elections he was continued in the legislature till the latter part of 1806
when he was elected to fill a vacancy of a single session in the united states senate
in 1807 he was again elected to the kentucky house of representatives
and by that body chosen speaker
in 1808 he was re elected to the same body
in 1809 he was again chosen to fill a vacancy of two years in the united states senate
in 1811 he was elected to the united states house of representatives
and on the first day of taking his seat in that body he was chosen its speaker
in 1813 he was again elected speaker
early in 1814
being the period of our last british war
clay was sent as commissioner
with others
to negotiate a treaty of peace
which treaty was concluded in the latter part of the same year
on his return from europe he was again elected to the lower branch of congress
and on taking his seat in december
was called to his old post the speaker's chair
a position in which he was retained by successive elections
with one brief intermission
till the inauguration of john quincy adams
in march
he was then appointed secretary of state
and occupied that important station till the inauguration of general jackson
in march
after this he returned to kentucky
resumed the practice of law
and continued it till the autumn of 1831
when he was by the legislature of kentucky again placed in the united states senate
by a reelection he was continued in the senate till he resigned his seat and retired
in march
in december
he again took his seat in the senate
which he again resigned only a few months before his death
by the foregoing it is perceived that the period from the beginning of mr
clay's official life in 1803 to the end of 1852 is but one year short of half a century
and that the sum of all the intervals in it will not amount to ten years
but mere duration of time in office constitutes the smallest part of mr
clay's history
throughout that long period he has constantly been the most loved and most implicitly followed by friends
and the most dreaded by opponents
of all living american politicians
in all the great questions which have agitated the country
and particularly in those fearful crises
the missouri question
the nullification question
and the late slavery question
as connected with the newly acquired territory
involving and endangering the stability of the union
his has been the leading and most conspicuous part
in 1824 he was first a candidate for the presidency
and was defeated and
although he was successively defeated for the same office in 1832 and in 1844
there has never been a moment since 1824 till after 1848 when a very large portion of the american people did not cling to him with an enthusiastic hope and purpose of still elevating him to the presidency
with other men
to be defeated was to be forgotten but with him defeat was but a trifling incident
neither changing him nor the world's estimate of him
even those of both political parties who have been preferred to him for the highest office have run far briefer courses than he
and left him still shining high in the heavens of the political world
van buren
and taylor all rose after
and set long before him
the spell the long enduring spell with which the souls of men were bound to him is a miracle
who can compass it
it is probably true he owed his pre eminence to no one quality
but to a fortunate combination of several
he was surpassingly eloquent but many eloquent men fail utterly
and they are not
as a class
generally successful
his judgment was excellent but many men of good judgment live and die unnoticed
his will was indomitable but this quality often secures to its owner nothing better than a character for useless obstinacy
were mr
clay's leading qualities
no one of them is very uncommon but all together are rarely combined in a single individual
and this is probably the reason why such men as henry clay are so rare in the world
clay's eloquence did not consist
as many fine specimens of eloquence do
of types and figures
of antithesis and elegant arrangement of words and sentences
but rather of that deeply earnest and impassioned tone and manner which can proceed only from great sincerity
and a thorough conviction in the speaker of the justice and importance of his cause
this it is that truly touches the chords of sympathy and those who heard mr
clay never failed to be moved by it
or ever afterward forgot the impression
all his efforts were made for practical effect
he never spoke merely to be heard
he never delivered a fourth of july oration
or a eulogy on an occasion like this
as a politician or statesman
no one was so habitually careful to avoid all sectional ground
whatever he did he did for the whole country
in the construction of his measures
he ever carefully surveyed every part of the field
and duly weighed every conflicting interest
feeling as he did
and as the truth surely is
that the world's best hope depended on the continued union of these states
he was ever jealous of and watchful for whatever might have the slightest tendency to separate them
clay's predominant sentiment
from first to last
was a deep devotion to the cause of human liberty a strong sympathy with the oppressed everywhere
and an ardent wish for their elevation
with him this was a primary and all controlling passion
subsidiary to this was the conduct of his whole life
he loved his country partly because it was his own country
and mostly because it was a free country and he burned with a zeal for its advancement
and glory
because he saw in such the advancement
and glory of human liberty
human right
and human nature
he desired the prosperity of his countrymen
partly because they were his countrymen
but chiefly to show to the world that free men could be prosperous
that his views and measures were always the wisest needs not to be affirmed nor should it be on this occasion
where so many thinking differently join in doing honor to his memory
a free people in times of peace and quiet when pressed by no common danger naturally divide into parties
at such times the man who is of neither party is not
cannot be
of any consequence
clay therefore was of a party
taking a prominent part
as he did
in all the great political questions of his country for the last half century
the wisdom of his course on many is doubted and denied by a large portion of his countrymen and of such it is not now proper to speak particularly
but there are many others
about his course upon which there is little or no disagreement amongst intelligent and patriotic americans
of these last are the war of 1812
the missouri question
and the now recent compromise measures
in 1812 mr
though not unknown
was still a young man
whether we should go to war with great britain being the question of the day
a minority opposed the declaration of war by congress
while the majority
though apparently inclined to war
had for years wavered
and hesitated to act decisively
meanwhile british aggressions multiplied
and grew more daring and aggravated
by mr
clay more than any other man the struggle was brought to a decision in congress
the question
being now fully before congress
came up in a variety of ways in rapid succession
on most of which occasions mr
clay spoke
adding to all the logic of which the subject was susceptible that noble inspiration which came to him as it came to no other
he aroused and nerved and inspired his friends
and confounded and bore down all opposition
several of his speeches on these occasions were reported and are still extant
but the best of them all never was
during its delivery the reporters forgot their vocation
dropped their pens
and sat enchanted from near the beginning to quite the close
the speech now lives only in the memory of a few old men
and the enthusiasm with which they cherish their recollection of it is absolutely astonishing
the precise language of this speech we shall never know but we do know we cannot help knowing that with deep pathos it pleaded the cause of the injured sailor
that it invoked the genius of the revolution
that it apostrophized the names of otis
of henry
and of washington
that it appealed to the interests
the pride
the honor
and the glory of the nation
that it shamed and taunted the timidity of friends
that it scorned and scouted and withered the temerity of domestic foes
that it bearded and defied the british lion
rising and swelling and maddening in its course
it sounded the onset
till the charge
the shock
the steady struggle
and the glorious victory all passed in vivid review before the entranced hearers
important and exciting as was the war question of 1812
it never so alarmed the sagacious statesmen of the country for the safety of the republic as afterward did the missouri question
this sprang from that unfortunate source of discord negro slavery
when our federal constitution was adopted
we owned no territory beyond the limits or ownership of the states
except the territory northwest of the river ohio and east of the mississippi
what has since been formed into the states of maine
kentucky and tennessee
i believe
within the limits of or owned by massachusetts
and north carolina
as to the northwestern territory
provision had been made even before the adoption of the constitution that slavery should never go there
on the admission of states into the union
carved from the territory we owned before the constitution
no question
or at most no considerable question
arose about slavery those which were within the limits of or owned by the old states following respectively the condition of the parent state
and those within the northwest territory following the previously made provision
but in 1803 we purchased louisiana of the french
and it included with much more what has since been formed into the state of missouri
with regard to it
nothing had been done to forestall the question of slavery
in 1819
having formed a state constitution without excluding slavery
and with slavery already actually existing within its limits
knocked at the door of the union for admission
almost the entire representation of the non slaveholding states objected
a fearful and angry struggle instantly followed
this alarmed thinking men more than any previous question
unlike all the former
it divided the country by geographical lines
other questions had their opposing partisans in all localities of the country and in almost every family
so that no division of the union could follow such without a separation of friends to quite as great an extent as that of opponents
not so with the missouri question
on this a geographical line could be traced
which in the main would separate opponents only
this was the danger
then in retirement
i had for a long time ceased to read newspapers or to pay any attention to public affairs
confident they were in good hands and content to be a passenger in our bark to the shore from which i am not distant
but this momentous question
like a firebell in the night
awakened and filled me with terror
i considered it at once as the knell of the union
it is hushed
for the moment
but this is a reprieve only
not a final sentence
a geographical line coinciding with a marked principle
moral and political
once conceived and held up to the angry passions of men
will never be obliterated
and every irritation will mark it deeper and deeper
i can say with conscious truth that there is not a man on earth who would sacrifice more than i would to relieve us from this heavy reproach in any practicable way
the cession of that kind of property for it is so misnamed is a bagatelle which would not cost me a second thought if in that way a general emancipation and expatriation could be effected
and gradually and with due sacrifices i think it might be
but as it is
we have the wolf by the ears
and we can neither hold him nor safely let him go
justice is in one scale
and self preservation in the other
mr
clay was in congress
perceiving the danger
at once engaged his whole energies to avert it
it began
as i have said
in 1819 and it did not terminate till 1821
missouri would not yield the point and congress that is
a majority in congress by repeated votes showed a determination not to admit the state unless it should yield
after several failures
and great labor on the part of mr
clay to so present the question that a majority could consent to the admission
it was by a vote rejected
as all seemed to think
a sullen gloom hung over the nation
all felt that the rejection of missouri was equivalent to a dissolution of the union
because those states which already had what missouri was rejected for refusing to relinquish would go with missouri
all deprecated and deplored this
but none saw how to avert it
for the judgment of members to be convinced of the necessity of yielding was not the whole difficulty each had a constituency to meet and to answer to
though worn down and exhausted
was appealed to by members to renew his efforts at compromise
he did so
and by some judicious modifications of his plan
coupled with laborious efforts with individual members and his own overmastering eloquence upon that floor
he finally secured the admission of the state
brightly and captivating as it had previously shown
it was now perceived that his great eloquence was a mere embellishment
or at most but a helping hand to his inventive genius and his devotion to his country in the day of her extreme peril
after the settlement of the missouri question
although a portion of the american people have differed with mr
and a majority even appear generally to have been opposed to him on questions of ordinary administration
he seems constantly to have been regarded by all as the man for the crisis
in the days of nullification
and more recently in the reappearance of the slavery question connected with our territory newly acquired of mexico
the task of devising a mode of adjustment seems to have been cast upon mr
clay by common consent and his performance of the task in each case was little else than a literal fulfilment of the public expectation
clay's efforts in behalf of the south americans
and afterward in behalf of the greeks
in the times of their respective struggles for civil liberty
are among the finest on record
upon the noblest of all themes
and bear ample corroboration of what i have said was his ruling passion a love of liberty and right
and for their own sakes
having been led to allude to domestic slavery so frequently already
i am unwilling to close without referring more particularly to mr
clay's views and conduct in regard to it
he ever was on principle and in feeling opposed to slavery
the very earliest
and one of the latest
public efforts of his life
separated by a period of more than fifty years
were both made in favor of gradual emancipation
he did not perceive that on a question of human right the negroes were to be excepted from the human race
and yet mr
clay was the owner of slaves
cast into life when slavery was already widely spread and deeply seated
he did not perceive
as i think no wise man has perceived
how it could be at once eradicated without producing a greater evil even to the cause of human liberty itself
his feeling and his judgment
ever led him to oppose both extremes of opinion on the subject
those who would shiver into fragments the union of these states
tear to tatters its now venerated constitution
and even burn the last copy of the bible
rather than slavery should continue a single hour
together with all their more halting sympathizers
have received
and are receiving
their just execration and the name and opinions and influence of mr
clay are fully and
as i trust
effectually and enduringly arrayed against them
but i would also
if i could
array his name
and influence against the opposite extreme against a few but an increasing number of men who
for the sake of perpetuating slavery
are beginning to assail and to ridicule the white man's charter of freedom
the declaration that all men are created free and equal
so far as i have learned
the first american of any note to do or attempt this was the late john c
calhoun and if i mistake not
it soon after found its way into some of the messages of the governor of south carolina
look for and are not much shocked by political eccentricities and heresies in south carolina
but only last year i saw with astonishment what purported to be a letter of a very distinguished and influential clergyman of virginia
with apparent approbation
into a st
louis newspaper
containing the following to me very unsatisfactory language
i am fully aware that there is a text in some bibles that is not in mine
professional abolitionists have made more use of it than of any passage in the bible
it came
as i trace it
from saint voltaire
and was baptized by thomas jefferson
and since almost universally regarded as canonical authority all men are born free and equal
 this is a genuine coin in the political currency of our generation
i am sorry to say that i have never seen two men of whom it is true
but i must admit i never saw the siamese twins
and therefore will not dogmatically say that no man ever saw a proof of this sage aphorism
this sounds strangely in republican america
the like was not heard in the fresher days of the republic
let us contrast with it the language of that truly national man whose life and death we now commemorate and lament
i quote from a speech of mr
clay delivered before the american colonization society in 1827
we are reproached with doing mischief by the agitation of this question
the society goes into no household to disturb its domestic tranquillity
it addresses itself to no slaves to weaken their obligations of obedience
it seeks to affect no man's property
it neither has the power nor the will to affect the property of any one contrary to his consent
the execution of its scheme would augment instead of diminishing the value of property left behind
the society
composed of free men
conceals itself only with the free
collateral consequences we are not responsible for
it is not this society which has produced the great moral revolution which the age exhibits
what would they who thus reproach us have done
if they would repress all tendencies toward liberty and ultimate emancipation
they must do more than put down the benevolent efforts of this society
they must go back to the era of our liberty and independence
and muzzle the cannon which thunders its annual joyous return
they must renew the slave trade
with all its train of atrocities
they must suppress the workings of british philanthropy
seeking to meliorate the condition of the unfortunate west indian slave
they must arrest the career of south american deliverance from thraldom
they must blow out the moral lights around us and extinguish that greatest torch of all which america presents to a benighted world pointing the way to their rights
their liberties
and their happiness
and when they have achieved all those purposes their work will be yet incomplete
they must penetrate the human soul
and eradicate the light of reason and the love of liberty
and not till then
when universal darkness and despair prevail
can you perpetuate slavery and repress all sympathy and all humane and benevolent efforts among free men in behalf of the unhappy portion of our race doomed to bondage
the american colonization society was organized in 1816
though not its projector
was one of its earliest members and he died
as for many preceding years he had been
its president
it was one of the most cherished objects of his direct care and consideration
and the association of his name with it has probably been its very greatest collateral support
he considered it no demerit in the society that it tended to relieve the slave holders from the troublesome presence of the free negroes but this was far from being its whole merit in his estimation
in the same speech from which we have quoted he says
there is a moral fitness in the idea of returning to africa her children
whose ancestors have been torn from her by the ruthless hand of fraud and violence
transplanted in a foreign land
they will carry back to their native soil the rich fruits of religion
and liberty
may it not be one of the great designs of the ruler of the universe
whose ways are often inscrutable by short sighted mortals
thus to transform an original crime into a signal blessing to that most unfortunate portion of the globe
this suggestion of the possible ultimate redemption of the african race and african continent was made twenty five years ago
every succeeding year has added strength to the hope of its realization
may it indeed be realized
pharaoh's country was cursed with plagues
and his hosts were lost in the red sea
for striving to retain a captive people who had already served them more than four hundred years
may like disasters never befall us
as the friends of colonization hope
the present and coming generations of our countrymen shall by any means succeed in freeing our land from the dangerous presence of slavery
and at the same time in restoring a captive people to their long lost fatherland with bright prospects for the future
and this too so gradually that neither races nor individuals shall have suffered by the change
it will indeed be a glorious consummation
and if to such a consummation the efforts of mr
clay shall have contributed
it will be what he most ardently wished
and none of his labors will have been more valuable to his country and his kind
but henry clay is dead
his long and eventful life is closed
our country is prosperous and powerful but could it have been quite all it has been
and is
and is to be
without henry clay
such a man the times have demanded
and such in the providence of god was given us
but he is gone
let us strive to deserve
as far as mortals may
the continued care of divine providence
trusting that in future national emergencies he will not fail to provide us the instruments of safety and security

challenged voters opinion on the illinois election law
november 1
1852 a leading article in the daily register of this morning has induced some of our friends to request our opinion on the election laws as applicable to challenged voters
we have examined the present constitution of the state
the election law of 1849
and the unrepealed parts of the election law in the revised code of 1845 and we are of the opinion that any person taking the oath prescribed in the act of 1849 is entitled to vote unless counter proof be made satisfactory to a majority of the judges that such oath is untrue and that for the purpose of obtaining such counter proof
the proposed voter may be asked questions in the way of cross examination
and other independent testimony may be received
we base our opinion as to receiving counter proof upon the unrepealed section nineteen of the election law in the revised code

beg of you to fully refresh your recollection by any means in your power before the time you may be called on to testify
if persons should come about you

dear sir
no doubt
remember the enclosed memorandum being handed me in your office
i have just made the desired search
and find that no such deed has ever been here
the auditor
says that if it were here
it would be in his office
and that he has hunted for it a dozen times
and could never find it
he says that one time and another
he has heard much about the matter
that it was not a deed for right of way
but a deed
for depot ground at least
a sale for depot ground
and there may never have been a deed
he says
if there is a deed
it is most probable general alexander
of paris
has it
yours truly
nebraska measure to j
palmer confidential springfield
dear sir
you know how anxious i am that this nebraska measure shall be rebuked and condemned everywhere
of course i hope something from your position yet i do not expect you to do anything which may be wrong in your own judgment nor would i have you do anything personally injurious to yourself
you are
and always have been
honestly and sincerely a democrat and i know how painful it must be to an honest
sincere man to be urged by his party to the support of a measure which in his conscience he believes to be wrong
you have had a severe struggle with yourself
and you have determined not to swallow the wrong
is it not just to yourself that you should
in a few public speeches
state your reasons
and thus justify yourself
i wish you would and yet i say
don't do it
if you think it will injure you
you may have given your word to vote for major harris and if so
of course you will stick to it
but allow me to suggest that you should avoid speaking of this for it probably would induce some of your friends in like manner to cast their votes
you understand
and now let me beg your pardon for obtruding this letter upon you
to whom i have ever been opposed in politics
had your party omitted to make nebraska a test of party fidelity
you probably would have been the democratic candidate for congress in the district
you deserved it
and i believe it would have been given you
in that case i should have been quite happy that nebraska was to be rebuked at all events
i still should have voted for the whig candidate but i should have made no speeches
written no letters and you would have been elected by at least a thousand majority
yours truly
to a

stranger though i am
being a brother in the faith
i venture to write you
yates can not come to your court next week
he is obliged to be at pike court where he has a case
with a fee of five hundred dollars
two hundred dollars already paid
to neglect it would be unjust to himself
and dishonest to his client
harris will be with you
head up and tail up
for nebraska
you must have some one to make an anti nebraska speech
palmer is the best
if you can get him
i think
if you can not get palmer
and somebody anyhow
if you can get neither
but press palmer hard
it is in his senatorial district

reply to senator douglas peoria speech speech at peoria
in reply to senator douglas
october 16
i do not rise to speak now
if i can stipulate with the audience to meet me here at half past six or at seven o'clock
it is now several minutes past five
and judge douglas has spoken over three hours
if you hear me at all
i wish you to hear me through
it will take me as long as it has taken him
that will carry us beyond eight o'clock at night
every one of you who can remain that long can just as well get his supper
meet me at seven
and remain an hour or two later
the judge has already informed you that he is to have an hour to reply to me
i doubt not but you have been a little surprised to learn that i have consented to give one of his high reputation and known ability this advantage of me
my consenting to it
though reluctant
was not wholly unselfish
for i suspected
if it were understood that the judge was entirely done
you democrats would leave and not hear me but by giving him the close
i felt confident you would stay for the fun of hearing him skin me
the audience signified their assent to the arrangement
and adjourned to seven o'clock p
at which time they reassembled
and mr
lincoln spoke substantially as follows
the repeal of the missouri compromise
and the propriety of its restoration
constitute the subject of what i am about to say
as i desire to present my own connected view of this subject
my remarks will not be specifically an answer to judge douglas yet
as i proceed
the main points he has presented will arise
and will receive such respectful attention as i may be able to give them
i wish further to say that i do not propose to question the patriotism or to assail the motives of any man or class of men
but rather to confine myself strictly to the naked merits of the question
i also wish to be no less than national in all the positions i may take
and whenever i take ground which others have thought
or may think
and dangerous to the union
i hope to give a reason which will appear sufficient
at least to some
why i think differently
and as this subject is no other than part and parcel of the larger general question of domestic slavery
i wish to make and to keep the distinction between the existing institution and the extension of it so broad and so clear that no honest man can misunderstand me
and no dishonest one successfully misrepresent me
in order to a clear understanding of what the missouri compromise is
a short history of the preceding kindred subjects will perhaps be proper
when we established our independence
we did not own or claim the country to which this compromise applies
strictly speaking
the confederacy then owned no country at all the states respectively owned the country within their limits
and some of them owned territory beyond their strict state limits
virginia thus owned the northwestern territory the country out of which the principal part of ohio
all indiana
all illinois
all michigan
and all wisconsin have since been formed
she also owned perhaps within her then limits what has since been formed into the state of kentucky
north carolina thus owned what is now the state of tennessee and south carolina and georgia owned
in separate parts
what are now mississippi and alabama
i think
owned the little remaining part of ohio
being the same where they now send giddings to congress and beat all creation in making cheese
these territories
together with the states themselves
constitute all the country over which the confederacy then claimed any sort of jurisdiction
we were then living under the articles of confederation
which were superseded by the constitution several years afterward
the question of ceding the territories to the general government was set on foot
the author of the declaration of independence
and otherwise a chief actor in the revolution then a delegate in congress afterward
twice president who was
and perhaps will continue to be
the most distinguished politician of our history a virginian by birth and continued residence
and withal a slaveholder
conceived the idea of taking that occasion to prevent slavery ever going into the northwestern territory
he prevailed on the virginia legislature to adopt his views
and to cede the territory
making the prohibition of slavery therein a condition of the deed
jefferson got only an understanding
not a condition of the deed to this wish
congress accepted the cession with the condition and the first ordinance which the acts of congress were then called for the government of the territory provided that slavery should never be permitted therein
this is the famed ordinance of '87
so often spoken of
thenceforward for sixty one years
and until
in 1848
the last scrap of this territory came into the union as the state of wisconsin
all parties acted in quiet obedience to this ordinance
it is now what jefferson foresaw and intended the happy home of teeming millions of free
prosperous people
and no slave among them
with the author of the declaration of independence
the policy of prohibiting slavery in new territory originated
away back to the constitution
in the pure
free breath of the revolution
the state of virginia and the national congress put that policy into practice
through more than sixty of the best years of the republic
did that policy steadily work to its great and beneficent end
and thus
in those five states
and in five millions of free
enterprising people
we have before us the rich fruits of this policy
but now new light breaks upon us
now congress declares this ought never to have been
and the like of it must never be again
the sacred right of self government is grossly violated by it
we even find some men who drew their first breath and every other breath of their lives under this very restriction
now live in dread of absolute suffocation if they should be restricted in the sacred right of taking slaves to nebraska
that perfect liberty they sigh for the liberty of making slaves of other people
jefferson never thought of
their own fathers never thought of
they never thought of themselves
a year ago
how fortunate for them they did not sooner become sensible of their great misery
how difficult it is to treat with respect such assaults upon all we have ever really held sacred
but to return to history
in 1803 we purchased what was then called louisiana
of france
it included the present states of louisiana
and iowa also the territory of minnesota
and the present bone of contention
kansas and nebraska
slavery already existed among the french at new orleans
and to some extent at st
in 1812 louisiana came into the union as a slave state
without controversy
in 1818 or '19
missouri showed signs of a wish to come in with slavery
this was resisted by northern members of congress and thus began the first great slavery agitation in the nation
this controversy lasted several months
and became very angry and exciting the house of representatives voting steadily for the prohibition of slavery in missouri
and the senate voting as steadily against it
threats of the breaking up of the union were freely made
and the ablest public men of the day became seriously alarmed
at length a compromise was made
in which
as in all compromises
both sides yielded something
it was a law
passed on the 6th of march
providing that missouri might come into the union with slavery
but that in all the remaining part of the territory purchased of france which lies north of thirty six degrees and thirty minutes north latitude
slavery should never be permitted
this provision of law is the missouri compromise
in excluding slavery north of the line
the same language is employed as in the ordinance of 1787
it directly applied to iowa
and to the present bone of contention
kansas and nebraska
whether there should or should not be slavery south of that line
nothing was said in the law
but arkansas constituted the principal remaining part south of the line and it has since been admitted as a slave state
without serious controversy
more recently
north of the line
came in as a free state without controversy
still later
north of the line
had a territorial organization without controversy
principally south of the line
and west of arkansas
though originally within the purchase from france
in 1819
been traded off to spain in our treaty for the acquisition of florida
it had thus become a part of mexico
mexico revolutionized and became independent of spain
american citizens began settling rapidly with their slaves in the southern part of texas
soon they revolutionized against mexico
and established an independent government of their own
adopting a constitution with slavery
strongly resembling the constitutions of our slave states
by still another rapid move
claiming a boundary much farther west than when we parted with her in 1819
was brought back to the united states
and admitted into the union as a slave state
then there was little or no settlement in the northern part of texas
a considerable portion of which lay north of the missouri line and in the resolutions admitting her into the union
the missouri restriction was expressly extended westward across her territory
this was in 1845
only nine years ago
thus originated the missouri compromise and thus has it been respected down to 1845
and even four years later
in 1849
our distinguished senator
in a public address
held the following language in relation to it
the missouri compromise has been in practical operation for about a quarter of a century
and has received the sanction and approbation of men of all parties in every section of the union
it has allayed all sectional jealousies and irritations growing out of this vexed question
and harmonized and tranquillized the whole country
it has given to henry clay
as its prominent champion
the proud sobriquet of the 'great pacificator
 and by that title
and for that service
his political friends had repeatedly appealed to the people to rally under his standard as a presidential candidate
as the man who had exhibited the patriotism and power to suppress an unholy and treasonable agitation
and preserve the union
he was not aware that any man or any party
from any section of the union
had ever urged as an objection to mr
clay that he was the great champion of the missouri compromise
on the contrary
the effort was made by the opponents of mr
clay to prove that he was not entitled to the exclusive merit of that great patriotic measure
and that the honor was equally due to others
as well as to him
for securing its adoption that it had its origin in the hearts of all patriotic men
who desired to preserve and perpetuate the blessings of our glorious union an origin akin to that of the constitution of the united states
conceived in the same spirit of fraternal affection
and calculated to remove forever the only danger which seemed to threaten
at some distant day
to sever the social bond of union
all the evidences of public opinion at that day seemed to indicate that this compromise had been canonized in the hearts of the american people
as a sacred thing which no ruthless hand would ever be reckless enough to disturb
i do not read this extract to involve judge douglas in an inconsistency
if he afterward thought he had been wrong
it was right for him to change
i bring this forward merely to show the high estimate placed on the missouri compromise by all parties up to so late as the year 1849
but going back a little in point of time
our war with mexico broke out in 1846
when congress was about adjourning that session
president polk asked them to place two millions of dollars under his control
to be used by him in the recess
if found practicable and expedient
in negotiating a treaty of peace with mexico
and acquiring some part of her territory
a bill was duly gotten up for the purpose
and was progressing swimmingly in the house of representatives
when a member by the name of david wilmot
a democrat from pennsylvania
moved as an amendment
that in any territory thus acquired there never shall be slavery
this is the origin of the far famed wilmot proviso
it created a great flutter but it stuck like wax
was voted into the bill
and the bill passed with it through the house
the senate
adjourned without final action on it
and so both appropriation and proviso were lost for the time
the war continued
and at the next session the president renewed his request for the appropriation
enlarging the amount
i think
to three millions
again came the proviso
and defeated the measure
congress adjourned again
and the war went on
in december
the new congress assembled
i was in the lower house that term
the wilmot proviso
or the principle of it
was constantly coming up in some shape or other
and i think i may venture to say i voted for it at least forty times during the short time i was there
the senate
held it in check
and it never became a law
in the spring of 1848 a treaty of peace was made with mexico
by which we obtained that portion of her country which now constitutes the territories of new mexico and utah and the present state of california
by this treaty the wilmot proviso was defeated
in so far as it was intended to be a condition of the acquisition of territory
its friends
were still determined to find some way to restrain slavery from getting into the new country
this new acquisition lay directly west of our old purchase from france
and extended west to the pacific ocean
and was so situated that if the missouri line should be extended straight west
the new country would be divided by such extended line
leaving some north and some south of it
on judge douglas's motion
a bill
or provision of a bill
passed the senate to so extend the missouri line
the proviso men in the house
including myself
voted it down
by implication
it gave up the southern part to slavery
while we were bent on having it all free
in the fall of 1848 the gold mines were discovered in california
this attracted people to it with unprecedented rapidity
so that on
or soon after
the meeting of the new congress in december
she already had a population of nearly a hundred thousand
had called a convention
formed a state constitution excluding slavery
and was knocking for admission into the union
the proviso men
of course
were for letting her in
but the senate
always true to the other side
would not consent to her admission
and there california stood
kept out of the union because she would not let slavery into her borders
under all the circumstances
this was not wrong
there were other points of dispute connected with the general question of slavery
which equally needed adjustment
the south clamored for a more efficient fugitive slave law
the north clamored for the abolition of a peculiar species of slave trade in the district of columbia
in connection with which
in view from the windows of the capitol
a sort of negro livery stable
where droves of negroes were collected
temporarily kept
and finally taken to southern markets
precisely like droves of horses
had been openly maintained for fifty years
utah and new mexico needed territorial governments and whether slavery should or should not be prohibited within them was another question
the indefinite western boundary of texas was to be settled
she was a slave state
and consequently the farther west the slavery men could push her boundary
the more slave country they secured and the farther east the slavery opponents could thrust the boundary back
the less slave ground was secured
thus this was just as clearly a slavery question as any of the others
these points all needed adjustment
and they were held up
perhaps wisely
to make them help adjust one another
the union now
as in 1820
was thought to be in danger
and devotion to the union rightfully inclined men to yield somewhat in points where nothing else could have so inclined them
a compromise was finally effected
the south got their new fugitive slave law
and the north got california
by far the best part of our acquisition from mexico as a free state
the south got a provision that new mexico and utah
when admitted as states
may come in with or without slavery as they may then choose and the north got the slave trade abolished in the district of columbia
the north got the western boundary of texas thrown farther back eastward than the south desired but
in turn
they gave texas ten millions of dollars with which to pay her old debts
this is the compromise of 1850
preceding the presidential election of 1852
each of the great political parties
democrats and whigs
met in convention and adopted resolutions indorsing the compromise of '50
as a finality
a final settlement
so far as these parties could make it so
of all slavery agitation
previous to this
in 1851
the illinois legislature had indorsed it
during this long period of time
nebraska the nebraska territory
not the state of as we know it now had remained substantially an uninhabited country
but now emigration to and settlement within it began to take place
it is about one third as large as the present united states
and its importance
so long overlooked
begins to come into view
the restriction of slavery by the missouri compromise directly applies to it in fact was first made
and has since been maintained expressly for it
in 1853
a bill to give it a territorial government passed the house of representatives
in the hands of judge douglas
failed of passing only for want of time
this bill contained no repeal of the missouri compromise
when it was assailed because it did not contain such repeal
judge douglas defended it in its existing form
on january 4
judge douglas introduces a new bill to give nebraska territorial government
he accompanies this bill with a report
in which last he expressly recommends that the missouri compromise shall neither be affirmed nor repealed
before long the bill is so modified as to make two territories instead of one
calling the southern one kansas
about a month after the introduction of the bill
on the judge's own motion it is so amended as to declare the missouri compromise inoperative and void and
that the people who go and settle there may establish slavery
or exclude it
as they may see fit
in this shape the bill passed both branches of congress and became a law
this is the repeal of the missouri compromise
the foregoing history may not be precisely accurate in every particular
but i am sure it is sufficiently so for all the use i shall attempt to make of it
and in it we have before us the chief material enabling us to judge correctly whether the repeal of the missouri compromise is right or wrong
i think
and shall try to show
that it is wrong wrong in its direct effect
letting slavery into kansas and nebraska
and wrong in its prospective principle
allowing it to spread to every other part of the wide world where men can be found inclined to take it
this declared indifference
as i must think
covert real zeal
for the spread of slavery
i cannot but hate
i hate it because of the monstrous injustice of slavery itself
i hate it because it deprives our republican example of its just influence in the world enables the enemies of free institutions with plausibility to taunt us as hypocrites causes the real friends of freedom to doubt our sincerity and especially because it forces so many good men among ourselves into an open war with the very fundamental principles of civil liberty
criticizing the declaration of independence
and insisting that there is no right principle of action but self interest
before proceeding let me say that i think i have no prejudice against the southern people
they are just what we would be in their situation
if slavery did not now exist among them
they would not introduce it
if it did now exist among us
we should not instantly give it up
this i believe of the masses north and south
doubtless there are individuals on both sides who would not hold slaves under any circumstances
and others who would gladly introduce slavery anew if it were out of existence
we know that some southern men do free their slaves
go north and become tip top abolitionists
while some northern ones go south and become most cruel slave masters
when southern people tell us that they are no more responsible for the origin of slavery than we are
i acknowledge the fact
when it is said that the institution exists
and that it is very difficult to get rid of it in any satisfactory way
i can understand and appreciate the saying
i surely will not blame them for not doing what i should not know how to do myself
if all earthly power were given me
i should not know what to do as to the existing institution
my first impulse would be to free all the slaves
and send them to liberia
to their own native land
but a moment's reflection would convince me that whatever of high hope as i think there is there may be in this in the long run
its sudden execution is impossible
if they were all landed there in a day
they would all perish in the next ten days and there are not surplus shipping and surplus money enough to carry them there in many times ten days
what then
free them all
and keep them among us as underlings
is it quite certain that this betters their condition
i think i would not hold one in slavery at any rate
yet the point is not clear enough for me to denounce people upon
what next
free them
and make them politically and socially our equals
my own feelings will not admit of this
and if mine would
we well know that those of the great mass of whites will not
whether this feeling accords with justice and sound judgment is not the sole question
if indeed it is any part of it
a universal feeling
whether well or ill founded
cannot be safely disregarded
we cannot then make them equals
it does seem to me that systems of gradual emancipation might be adopted
but for their tardiness in this i will not undertake to judge our brethren of the south
when they remind us of their constitutional rights
i acknowledge them not grudgingly
but fully and fairly and i would give them any legislation for the reclaiming of their fugitives which should not in its stringency be more likely to carry a free man into slavery than our ordinary criminal laws are to hang an innocent one
but all this
to my judgment
furnishes no more excuse for permitting slavery to go into our own free territory than it would for reviving the african slave trade by law
the law which forbids the bringing of slaves from africa
and that which has so long forbidden the taking of them into nebraska
can hardy be distinguished on any moral principle
and the repeal of the former could find quite as plausible excuses as that of the latter
the arguments by which the repeal of the missouri compromise is sought to be justified are these
that the nebraska country needed a territorial government
that in various ways the public had repudiated that compromise and demanded the repeal
and therefore should not now complain of it
that the repeal establishes a principle which is intrinsically right
i will attempt an answer to each of them in its turn
if that country was in need of a territorial organization
could it not have had it as well without as with a repeal
iowa and minnesota
to both of which the missouri restriction applied
without its repeal
each in succession
territorial organizations
and even the year before
a bill for nebraska itself was within an ace of passing without the repealing clause
and this in the hands of the same men who are now the champions of repeal
why no necessity then for repeal
but still later
when this very bill was first brought in
it contained no repeal
say they
because the people had demanded
or rather commanded
the repeal
the repeal was to accompany the organization whenever that should occur
i deny that the public ever demanded any such thing ever repudiated the missouri compromise
ever commanded its repeal
i deny it
and call for the proof
it is not contended
i believe
that any such command has ever been given in express terms
it is only said that it was done in principle
the support of the wilmot proviso is the first fact mentioned to prove that the missouri restriction was repudiated in principle
and the second is the refusal to extend the missouri line over the country acquired from mexico
these are near enough alike to be treated together
the one was to exclude the chances of slavery from the whole new acquisition by the lump
and the other was to reject a division of it
by which one half was to be given up to those chances
whether this was a repudiation of the missouri line in principle depends upon whether the missouri law contained any principle requiring the line to be extended over the country acquired from mexico
i contend it did not
i insist that it contained no general principle
but that it was
in every sense
that its terms limit it to the country purchased from france is undenied and undeniable
it could have no principle beyond the intention of those who made it
they did not intend to extend the line to country which they did not own
if they intended to extend it in the event of acquiring additional territory
why did they not say so
it was just as easy to say that in all the country west of the mississippi which we now own
or may hereafter acquire
there shall never be slavery
as to say what they did say and they would have said it if they had meant it
an intention to extend the law is not only not mentioned in the law
but is not mentioned in any contemporaneous history
both the law itself
and the history of the times
are a blank as to any principle of extension and by neither the known rules of construing statutes and contracts
nor by common sense
can any such principle be inferred
another fact showing the specific character of the missouri law showing that it intended no more than it expressed
showing that the line was not intended as a universal dividing line between free and slave territory
present and prospective
north of which slavery could never go is the fact that by that very law missouri came in as a slave state
north of the line
if that law contained any prospective principle
the whole law must be looked to in order to ascertain what the principle was
and by this rule the south could fairly contend that
inasmuch as they got one slave state north of the line at the inception of the law
they have the right to have another given them north of it occasionally
now and then
in the indefinite westward extension of the line
this demonstrates the absurdity of attempting to deduce a prospective principle from the missouri compromise line
when we voted for the wilmot proviso we were voting to keep slavery out of the whole mexican acquisition
and little did we think we were thereby voting to let it into nebraska lying several hundred miles distant
when we voted against extending the missouri line
little did we think we were voting to destroy the old line
then of near thirty years' standing
to argue that we thus repudiated the missouri compromise is no less absurd than it would be to argue that because we have so far forborne to acquire cuba
we have thereby
in principle
repudiated our former acquisitions and determined to throw them out of the union
no less absurd than it would be to say that because i may have refused to build an addition to my house
i thereby have decided to destroy the existing house
and if i catch you setting fire to my house
you will turn upon me and say i instructed you to do it
the most conclusive argument
that while for the wilmot proviso
and while voting against the extension of the missouri line
we never thought of disturbing the original missouri compromise
is found in the fact that there was then
and still is
an unorganized tract of fine country
nearly as large as the state of missouri
lying immediately west of arkansas and south of the missouri compromise line
and that we never attempted to prohibit slavery as to it
i wish particular attention to this
it adjoins the original missouri compromise line by its northern boundary
and consequently is part of the country into which by implication slavery was permitted to go by that compromise
there it has lain open ever s
and there it still lies
and yet no effort has been made at any time to wrest it from the south
in all our struggles to prohibit slavery within our mexican acquisitions
we never so much as lifted a finger to prohibit it as to this tract
is not this entirely conclusive that at all times we have held the missouri compromise as a sacred thing
even when against ourselves as well as when for us
senator douglas sometimes says the missouri line itself was in principle only an extension of the line of the ordinance of '87 that is to say
an extension of the ohio river
i think this is weak enough on its face
i will remark
as a glance at the map will show
the missouri line is a long way farther south than the ohio
and that if our senator in proposing his extension had stuck to the principle of jogging southward
perhaps it might not have been voted down so readily
but next it is said that the compromises of '50
and the ratification of them by both political parties in '52
established a new principle which required the repeal of the missouri compromise
this again i deny
i deny it
and demand the proof
i have already stated fully what the compromises of '50 are
that particular part of those measures from which the virtual repeal of the missouri compromise is sought to be inferred for it is admitted they contain nothing about it in express terms is the provision in the utah and new mexico laws which permits them when they seek admission into the union as states to come in with or without slavery
as they shall then see fit
now i insist this provision was made for utah and new mexico
and for no other place whatever
it had no more direct reference to nebraska than it had to the territories of the moon
say they
it had reference to nebraska in principle
let us see
the north consented to this provision
not because they considered it right in itself
but because they were compensated paid for it
they at the same time got california into the union as a free state
this was far the best part of all they had struggled for by the wilmot proviso
they also got the area of slavery somewhat narrowed in the settlement of the boundary of texas
also they got the slave trade abolished in the district of columbia
for all these desirable objects the north could afford to yield something and they did yield to the south the utah and new mexico provision
i do not mean that the whole north
or even a majority
when the law passed but enough yielded when added to the vote of the south
to carry the measure
nor can it be pretended that the principle of this arrangement requires us to permit the same provision to be applied to nebraska
without any equivalent at all
give us another free state press the boundary of texas still farther back give us another step toward the destruction of slavery in the district
and you present us a similar case
but ask us not to repeat
for nothing
what you paid for in the first instance
if you wish the thing again
pay again
that is the principle of the compromises of '50
they had any principles beyond their specific terms it was the system of equivalents
if congress
at that time
intended that all future territories should
when admitted as states
come in with or without slavery at their own option
why did it not say so
with such a universal provision
all know the bills could not have passed
did they
then could they establish a principle contrary to their own intention
still further
if they intended to establish the principle that
whenever congress had control
it should be left to the people to do as they thought fit with slavery
why did they not authorize the people of the district of columbia
at their option
to abolish slavery within their limits
i personally know that this has not been left undone because it was unthought of
it was frequently spoken of by members of congress
and by citizens of washington
six years ago and i heard no one express a doubt that a system of gradual emancipation
with compensation to owners
would meet the approbation of a large majority of the white people of the district
but without the action of congress they could say nothing and congress said no
in the measures of 1850
congress had the subject of slavery in the district expressly on hand
if they were then establishing the principle of allowing the people to do as they please with slavery
why did they not apply the principle to that people
again it is claimed that by the resolutions of the illinois legislature
passed in 1851
the repeal of the missouri compromise was demanded
this i deny also
whatever may be worked out by a criticism of the language of those resolutions
the people have never understood them as being any more than an indorsement of the compromises of 1850
and a release of our senators from voting for the wilmot proviso
the whole people are living witnesses that this only was their view
it is asked
if we did not mean to apply the utah and new mexico provision to all future territories
what did we mean when we
in 1852
indorsed the compromises of 1850
for myself i can answer this question most easily
i meant not to ask a repeal or modification of the fugitive slave law
i meant not to ask for the abolition of slavery in the district of columbia
i meant not to resist the admission of utah and new mexico
even should they ask to come in as slave states
i meant nothing about additional territories
as i understood
we then had no territory whose character as to slavery was not already settled
as to nebraska
i regarded its character as being fixed by the missouri compromise for thirty years as unalterably fixed as that of my own home in illinois
as to new acquisitions
i said
sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof
when we make new acquisitions
we will
as heretofore
try to manage them somehow
that is my answer that is what i meant and said and i appeal to the people to say each for himself whether that is not also the universal meaning of the free states
and now
in turn
let me ask a few questions
by any or all these matters
the repeal of the missouri compromise was commanded
why was not the command sooner obeyed
why was the repeal omitted in the nebraska bill of 1853
why was it omitted in the original bill of 1854
why in the accompanying report was such a repeal characterized as a departure from the course pursued in 1850 and its continued omission recommended
i am aware judge douglas now argues that the subsequent express repeal is no substantial alteration of the bill
this argument seems wonderful to me
it is as if one should argue that white and black are not different
he admits
that there is a literal change in the bill
and that he made the change in deference to other senators who would not support the bill without
this proves that those other senators thought the change a substantial one
and that the judge thought their opinions worth deferring to
his own opinions
seem not to rest on a very firm basis
even in his own mind and i suppose the world believes
and will continue to believe
that precisely on the substance of that change this whole agitation has arisen
i conclude
that the public never demanded the repeal of the missouri compromise
i now come to consider whether the appeal with its avowed principles
is intrinsically right
i insist that it is not
take the particular case
a controversy had arisen between the advocates and opponents of slavery
in relation to its establishment within the country we had purchased of france
the southern
and then best
part of the purchase was already in as a slave state
the controversy was settled by also letting missouri in as a slave state but with the agreement that within all the remaining part of the purchase
north of a certain line
there should never be slavery
as to what was to be done with the remaining part
south of the line
nothing was said but perhaps the fair implication was
it should come in with slavery if it should so choose
the southern part
except a portion heretofore mentioned
afterward did come in with slavery
as the state of arkansas
all these many years
since 1820
the northern part had remained a wilderness
at length settlements began in it also
in due course iowa came in as a free state
and minnesota was given a territorial government
without removing the slavery restriction
the sole remaining part north of the line kansas and nebraska was to be organized and it is proposed
and carried
to blot out the old dividing line of thirty four years' standing
and to open the whole of that country to the introduction of slavery
now this
to my mind
is manifestly unjust
after an angry and dangerous controversy
the parties made friends by dividing the bone of contention
the one party first appropriates her own share
beyond all power to be disturbed in the possession of it
and then seizes the share of the other party
it is as if two starving men had divided their only loaf
the one had hastily swallowed his half
and then grabbed the other's half just as he was putting it to his mouth
let me here drop the main argument
to notice what i consider rather an inferior matter
it is argued that slavery will not go to kansas and nebraska
in any event
this is a palliation
a lullaby
i have some hope that it will not but let us not be too confident
as to climate
a glance at the map shows that there are five slave states delaware
and missouri
and also the district of columbia
all north of the missouri compromise line
the census returns of 1850 show that within these there are eight hundred and sixty seven thousand two hundred and seventy six slaves
being more than one fourth of all the slaves in the nation
it is not climate
that will keep slavery out of these territories
is there anything in the peculiar nature of the country
missouri adjoins these territories by her entire western boundary
and slavery is already within every one of her western counties
i have even heard it said that there are more slaves in proportion to whites in the northwestern county of missouri than within any other county in the state
slavery pressed entirely up to the old western boundary of the state
and when rather recently a part of that boundary at the northwest was moved out a little farther west
slavery followed on quite up to the new line
when the restriction is removed
what is to prevent it from going still farther
climate will not
no peculiarity of the country will
nothing in nature will
will the disposition of the people prevent it
those nearest the scene are all in favor of the extension
the yankees who are opposed to it may be most flumerous but
in military phrase
the battlefield is too far from their base of operations
but it is said there now is no law in nebraska on the subject of slavery
and that
in such case
taking a slave there operates his freedom
that is good book law
but it is not the rule of actual practice
wherever slavery is it has been first introduced without law
the oldest laws we find concerning it are not laws introducing it
but regulating it as an already existing thing
a white man takes his slave to nebraska now
who will inform the negro that he is free
who will take him before court to test the question of his freedom
in ignorance of his legal emancipation he is kept chopping
and plowing
others are brought
and move on in the same track
at last
if ever the time for voting comes on the question of slavery the institution already
in fact
exists in the country
and cannot well be removed
the fact of its presence
and the difficulty of its removal
will carry the vote in its favor
keep it out until a vote is taken
and a vote in favor of it cannot be got in any population of forty thousand on earth
who have been drawn together by the ordinary motives of emigration and settlement
to get slaves into the territory simultaneously with the whites in the incipient stages of settlement is the precise stake played for and won in this nebraska measure
the question is asked us
if slaves will go in notwithstanding the general principle of law liberates them
why would they not equally go in against positive statute law go in
even if the missouri restriction were maintained
i answer
because it takes a much bolder man to venture in with his property in the latter case than in the former because the positive congressional enactment is known to and respected by all
or nearly all
whereas the negative principle that no law is free law is not much known except among lawyers
we have some experience of this practical difference
in spite of the ordinance of '87
a few negroes were brought into illinois
and held in a state of quasi slavery
not enough
to carry a vote of the people in favor of the institution when they came to form a constitution
but into the adjoining missouri country
where there was no ordinance of '87
was no restriction
they were carried ten times
a hundred times
as fast
and actually made a slave state
this is fact naked fact
another lullaby argument is that taking slaves to new countries does not increase their number
does not make any one slave who would otherwise be free
there is some truth in this
and i am glad of it but it is not wholly true
the african slave trade is not yet effectually suppressed and
if we make a reasonable deduction for the white people among us who are foreigners and the descendants of foreigners arriving here since 1808
we shall find the increase of the black population outrunning that of the white to an extent unaccountable
except by supposing that some of them
have been coming from africa
if this be so
the opening of new countries to the institution increases the demand for and augments the price of slaves
and so does
in fact
make slaves of freemen
by causing them to be brought from africa and sold into bondage
but however this may be
we know the opening of new countries to slavery tends to the perpetuation of the institution
and so does keep men in slavery who would otherwise be free
this result we do not feel like favoring
and we are under no legal obligation to suppress our feelings in this respect
equal justice to the south
it is said
requires us to consent to the extension of slavery to new countries
that is to say
inasmuch as you do not object to my taking my hog to nebraska
therefore i must not object to your taking your slave
i admit that this is perfectly logical if there is no difference between hogs and negroes
but while you thus require me to deny the humanity of the negro
i wish to ask whether you of the south
have ever been willing to do as much
it is kindly provided that of all those who come into the world only a small percentage are natural tyrants
that percentage is no larger in the slave states than in the free
the great majority south
as well as north
have human sympathies
of which they can no more divest themselves than they can of their sensibility to physical pain
these sympathies in the bosoms of the southern people manifest
in many ways
their sense of the wrong of slavery
and their consciousness that
after all
there is humanity in the negro
if they deny this
let me address them a few plain questions
in 1820 you the south joined the north
almost unanimously
in declaring the african slave trade piracy
and in annexing to it the punishment of death
why did you do this
if you did not feel that it was wrong
why did you join in providing that men should be hung for it
the practice was no more than bringing wild negroes from africa to such as would buy them
but you never thought of hanging men for catching and selling wild horses
wild buffaloes
or wild bears
you have among you a sneaking individual of the class of native tyrants known as the slavedealer
he watches your necessities
and crawls up to buy your slave
at a speculating price
if you cannot help it
you sell to him but if you can help it
you drive him from your door
you despise him utterly
you do not recognize him as a friend
or even as an honest man
your children must not play with his they may rollick freely with the little negroes
but not with the slave dealer's children
if you are obliged to deal with him
you try to get through the job without so much as touching him
it is common with you to join hands with the men you meet
but with the slave dealer you avoid the ceremony instinctively shrinking from the snaky contact
if he grows rich and retires from business
you still remember him
and still keep up the ban of non intercourse upon him and his family
why is this
you do not so treat the man who deals in corn
or tobacco
and yet again
there are in the united states and territories
including the district of columbia
643 free blacks
at five hundred dollars per head they are worth over two hundred millions of dollars
how comes this vast amount of property to be running about without owners
we do not see free horses or free cattle running at large
how is this
all these free blacks are the descendants of slaves
or have been slaves themselves and they would be slaves now but for something which has operated on their white owners
inducing them at vast pecuniary sacrifice to liberate them
what is that something
is there any mistaking it
in all these cases it is your sense of justice and human sympathy continually telling you that the poor negro has some natural right to himself that those who deny it and make mere merchandise of him deserve kickings
and death
and now why will you ask us to deny the humanity of the slave
and estimate him as only the equal of the hog
why ask us to do what you will not do yourselves
why ask us to do for nothing what two hundred millions of dollars could not induce you to do
but one great argument in support of the repeal of the missouri compromise is still to come
that argument is the sacred right of self government
it seems our distinguished senator has found great difficulty in getting his antagonists
even in the senate
to meet him fairly on this argument
some poet has said
fools rush in where angels fear to tread
at the hazard of being thought one of the fools of this quotation
i meet that argument i rush in i take that bull by the horns
i trust i understand and truly estimate the right of self government
my faith in the proposition that each man should do precisely as he pleases with all which is exclusively his own lies at the foundation of the sense of justice there is in me
i extend the principle to communities of men as well as to individuals
i so extend it because it is politically wise
as well as naturally just politically wise in saving us from broils about matters which do not concern us
or at washington
i would not trouble myself with the oyster laws of virginia
or the cranberry laws of indiana
the doctrine of self government is right
absolutely and eternally right
but it has no just application as here attempted
or perhaps i should rather say that whether it has such application depends upon whether a negro is or is not a man
if he is not a man
in that case he who is a man may as a matter of self government do just what he pleases with him
but if the negro is a man
is it not to that extent a total destruction of self government to say that he too shall not govern himself
when the white man governs himself
that is self government but when he governs himself and also governs another man
that is more than self government that is despotism
if the negro is a man
my ancient faith teaches me that all men are created equal
and that there can be no moral right in connection with one man's making a slave of another
judge douglas frequently
with bitter irony and sarcasm
paraphrases our argument by saying
the white people of nebraska are good enough to govern themselves
but they are not good enough to govern a few miserable negroes
well
i doubt not that the people of nebraska are and will continue to be as good as the average of people elsewhere
i do not say the contrary
what i do say is that no man is good enough to govern another man without that other's consent
i say this is the leading principle
the sheet anchor of american republicanism
our declaration of independence says
we hold these truths to be self evident
that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights that among these are life
and the pursuit of happiness
that to secure these rights
governments are instituted among men
deriving their just powers prom the consent of the governed
i have quoted so much at this time merely to show that
according to our ancient faith
the just powers of government are derived from the consent of the governed
now the relation of master and slave is pro tanto a total violation of this principle
the master not only governs the slave without his consent
but he governs him by a set of rules altogether different from those which he prescribes for himself
allow all the governed an equal voice in the government
and that
and that only
is self government
let it not be said that i am contending for the establishment of political and social equality between the whites and blacks
i have already said the contrary
i am not combating the argument of necessity
arising from the fact that the blacks are already among us but i am combating what is set up as moral argument for allowing them to be taken where they have never yet been arguing against the extension of a bad thing
where it already exists
we must of necessity manage as we best can
in support of his application of the doctrine of self government
senator douglas has sought to bring to his aid the opinions and examples of our revolutionary fathers
i am glad he has done this
i love the sentiments of those old time men
and shall be most happy to abide by their opinions
he shows us that when it was in contemplation for the colonies to break off from great britain
and set up a new government for themselves
several of the states instructed their delegates to go for the measure
provided each state should be allowed to regulate its domestic concerns in its own way
i do not quote but this in substance
this was right i see nothing objectionable in it
i also think it probable that it had some reference to the existence of slavery among them
i will not deny that it had
but had it any reference to the carrying of slavery into new countries
that is the question
and we will let the fathers themselves answer it
this same generation of men
and mostly the same individuals of the generation who declared this principle
who declared independence
who fought the war of the revolution through
who afterward made the constitution under which we still live these same men passed the ordinance of '87
declaring that slavery should never go to the northwest territory
i have no doubt judge douglas thinks they were very inconsistent in this
it is a question of discrimination between them and him
but there is not an inch of ground left for his claiming that their opinions
their example
their authority
are on his side in the controversy
is not nebraska
while a territory
a part of us
do we not own the country
and if we surrender the control of it
do we not surrender the right of self government
it is part of ourselves
if you say we shall not control it
because it is only part
the same is true of every other part and when all the parts are gone
what has become of the whole
what is then left of us
what use for the general government
when there is nothing left for it to govern
but you say this question should be left to the people of nebraska
because they are more particularly interested
if this be the rule
you must leave it to each individual to say for himself whether he will have slaves
what better moral right have thirty one citizens of nebraska to say that the thirty second shall not hold slaves than the people of the thirty one states have to say that slavery shall not go into the thirty second state at all
but if it is a sacred right for the people of nebraska to take and hold slaves there
it is equally their sacred right to buy them where they can buy them cheapest and that
will be on the coast of africa
provided you will consent not to hang them for going there to buy them
you must remove this restriction
from the sacred right of self government
i am aware you say that taking slaves from the states to nebraska does not make slaves of freemen but the african slave trader can say just as much
he does not catch free negroes and bring them here
he finds them already slaves in the hands of their black captors
and he honestly buys them at the rate of a red cotton handkerchief a head
this is very cheap
and it is a great abridgment of the sacred right of self government to hang men for engaging in this profitable trade
another important objection to this application of the right of self government is that it enables the first few to deprive the succeeding many of a free exercise of the right of self government
the first few may get slavery in
and the subsequent many cannot easily get it out
how common is the remark now in the slave states
if we were only clear of our slaves
how much better it would be for us
they are actually deprived of the privilege of governing themselves as they would
by the action of a very few in the beginning
the same thing was true of the whole nation at the time our constitution was formed
whether slavery shall go into nebraska
or other new territories
is not a matter of exclusive concern to the people who may go there
the whole nation is interested that the best use shall be made of these territories
we want them for homes of free white people
this they cannot be
to any considerable extent
if slavery shall be planted within them
slave states are places for poor white people to remove from
not to remove to
new free states are the places for poor people to go to
and better their condition
for this use the nation needs these territories
still further
there are constitutional relations between the slave and free states which are degrading to the latter
we are under legal obligations to catch and return their runaway slaves to them
a sort of dirty
disagreeable job
i believe
as a general rule
the slaveholders will not perform for one another
then again
in the control of the government the management of the partnership affairs they have greatly the advantage of us
by the constitution each state has two senators
each has a number of representatives in proportion to the number of its people
and each has a number of presidential electors equal to the whole number of its senators and representatives together
but in ascertaining the number of the people for this purpose
five slaves are counted as being equal to three whites
the slaves do not vote they are only counted and so used as to swell the influence of the white people's votes
the practical effect of this is more aptly shown by a comparison of the states of south carolina and maine
south carolina has six representatives
and so has maine south carolina has eight presidential electors
and so has maine
this is precise equality so far and of course they are equal in senators
each having two
thus in the control of the government the two states are equals precisely
but how are they in the number of their white people
maine has 581
while south carolina has 274
567 maine has twice as many as south carolina
and 32
679 over
each white man in south carolina is more than the double of any man in maine
this is all because south carolina
besides her free people
has 384
984 slaves
the south carolinian has precisely the same advantage over the white man in every other free state as well as in maine
he is more than the double of any one of us in this crowd
the same advantage
but not to the same extent
is held by all the citizens of the slave states over those of the free and it is an absolute truth
without an exception
that there is no voter in any slave state but who has more legal power in the government than any voter in any free state
there is no instance of exact equality and the disadvantage is against us the whole chapter through
this principle
in the aggregate
gives the slave states in the present congress twenty additional representatives
being seven more than the whole majority by which they passed the nebraska bill
now all this is manifestly unfair yet i do not mention it to complain of it
in so far as it is already settled
it is in the constitution
and i do not for that cause
or any other cause
propose to destroy
or alter
or disregard the constitution
i stand to it
and firmly
but when i am told i must leave it altogether to other people to say whether new partners are to be bred up and brought into the firm
on the same degrading terms against me
i respectfully demur
i insist that whether i shall be a whole man or only the half of one
in comparison with others is a question in which i am somewhat concerned
and one which no other man can have a sacred right of deciding for me
if i am wrong in this
if it really be a sacred right of self government in the man who shall go to nebraska to decide whether he will be the equal of me or the double of me
after he shall have exercised that right
and thereby shall have reduced me to a still smaller fraction of a man than i already am
i should like for some gentleman
deeply skilled in the mysteries of sacred rights
to provide himself with a microscope
and peep about
and find out
if he can
what has become of my sacred rights
they will surely be too small for detection with the naked eye
i insist that if there is anything which it is the duty of the whole people to never intrust to any hands but their own
that thing is the preservation and perpetuity of their own liberties and institutions
and if they shall think as i do
that the extension of slavery endangers them more than any or all other causes
how recreant to themselves if they submit the question
and with it the fate of their country
to a mere handful of men bent only on seif interest
if this question of slavery extension were an insignificant one
one having no power to do harm it might be shuffled aside in this way and being
as it is
the great behemoth of danger
shall the strong grip of the nation be loosened upon him
to intrust him to the hands of such feeble keepers
i have done with this mighty argument of self government
sacred thing
go in peace
but nebraska is urged as a great union saving measure
i too go for saving the union
much as i hate slavery
i would consent to the extension of it rather than see the union dissolved
just as i would consent to any great evil to avoid a greater one
but when i go to union saving
i must believe
at least
that the means i employ have some adaptation to the end
to my mind
nebraska has no such adaptation
it hath no relish of salvation in it
it is an aggravation
of the only one thing which ever endangers the union
when it came upon us
all was peace and quiet
the nation was looking to the forming of new bends of union
and a long course of peace and prosperity seemed to lie before us
in the whole range of possibility
there scarcely appears to me to have been anything out of which the slavery agitation could have been revived
except the very project of repealing the missouri compromise
every inch of territory we owned already had a definite settlement of the slavery question
by which all parties were pledged to abide
there was no uninhabited country on the continent which we could acquire
if we except some extreme northern regions which are wholly out of the question
in this state of affairs the genius of discord himself could scarcely have invented a way of again setting us by the ears but by turning back and destroying the peace measures of the past
the counsels of that genius seem to have prevailed
the missouri compromise was repealed and here we are in the midst of a new slavery agitation
i think
as we have never seen before
who is responsible for this
is it those who resist the measure
or those who causelessly brought it forward
and pressed it through
having reason to know
and in fact knowing
it must and would be so resisted
it could not but be expected by its author that it would be looked upon as a measure for the extension of slavery
aggravated by a gross breach of faith
argue as you will and long as you will
this is the naked front and aspect of the measure
and in this aspect it could not but produce agitation
slavery is founded in the selfishness of man's nature opposition to it in his love of justice
these principles are at eternal antagonism
and when brought into collision so fiercely as slavery extension brings them
shocks and throes and convulsions must ceaselessly follow
repeal the missouri compromise
repeal all compromises
repeal the declaration of independence
repeal all past history
you still cannot repeal human nature
it still will be the abundance of man's heart that slavery extension is wrong
and out of the abundance of his heart his mouth will continue to speak
the structure
of the nebraska bill is very peculiar
the people are to decide the question of slavery for themselves but when they are to decide
or how they are to decide
or whether
when the question is once decided
it is to remain so or is to be subject to an indefinite succession of new trials
the law does not say
is it to be decided by the first dozen settlers who arrive there
or is it to await the arrival of a hundred
is it to be decided by a vote of the people or a vote of the legislature
by a vote of any sort
to these questions the law gives no answer
there is a mystery about this for when a member proposed to give the legislature express authority to exclude slavery
it was hooted down by the friends of the bill
this fact is worth remembering
some yankees in the east are sending emigrants to nebraska to exclude slavery from it and
so far as i can judge
they expect the question to be decided by voting in some way or other
but the missourians are awake
they are within a stone's throw of the contested ground
they hold meetings and pass resolutions
in which not the slightest allusion to voting is made
they resolve that slavery already exists in the territory that more shall go there that they
remaining in missouri
will protect it
and that abolitionists shall be hung or driven away
through all this bowie knives and six shooters are seen plainly enough
but never a glimpse of the ballot box
what is the result of all this
each party within having numerous and determined backers without
is it not probable that the contest will come to blows and bloodshed
could there be a more apt invention to bring about collision and violence on the slavery question than this nebraska project is
i do not charge or believe that such was intended by congress but if they had literally formed a ring and placed champions within it to fight out the controversy
the fight could be no more likely to come off than it is
and if this fight should begin
is it likely to take a very peaceful
union saving turn
will not the first drop of blood so shed be the real knell of the union
the missouri compromise ought to be restored
for the sake of the union
it ought to be restored
we ought to elect a house of representatives which will vote its restoration
if by any means we omit to do this
what follows
slavery may or may not be established in nebraska
but whether it be or not
we shall have repudiated discarded from the councils of the nation the spirit of compromise for who
after this
will ever trust in a national compromise
the spirit of mutual concession that spirit which first gave us the constitution
and which has thrice saved the union we shall have strangled and cast from us forever
and what shall we have in lieu of it
the south flushed with triumph and tempted to excess the north
betrayed as they believe
brooding on wrong and burning for revenge
one side will provoke
the other resent
the one will taunt
the other defy one aggresses
the other retaliates
already a few in the north defy all constitutional restraints
resist the execution of the fugitive slave law
and even menace the institution of slavery in the states where it exists
already a few in the south claim the constitutional right to take and to hold slaves in the free states
demand the revival of the slave trade
and demand a treaty with great britain by which fugitive slaves may be reclaimed from canada
as yet they are but few on either side
it is a grave question for lovers of the union whether the final destruction of the missouri compromise
and with it the spirit of all compromise
will or will not embolden and embitter each of these
and fatally increase the number of both
but restore the compromise
and what then
we thereby restore the national faith
the national confidence
the national feeling of brotherhood
we thereby reinstate the spirit of concession and compromise
that spirit which has never failed us in past perils
and which may be safely trusted for all the future
the south ought to join in doing this
the peace of the nation is as dear to them as to us
in memories of the past and hopes of the future
they share as largely as we
it would be on their part a great act great in its spirit
and great in its effect
it would be worth to the nation a hundred years purchase of peace and prosperity
and what of sacrifice would they make
they only surrender to us what they gave us for a consideration long
long ago what they have not now asked for
struggled or cared for what has been thrust upon them
not less to their astonishment than to ours
but it is said we cannot restore it that though we elect every member of the lower house
the senate is still against us
it is quite true that of the senators who passed the nebraska bill a majority of the whole senate will retain their seats in spite of the elections of this and the next year
but if at these elections their several constituencies shall clearly express their will against nebraska
will these senators disregard their will
will they neither obey nor make room for those who will
but even if we fail to technically restore the compromise
it is still a great point to carry a popular vote in favor of the restoration
the moral weight of such a vote cannot be estimated too highly
the authors of nebraska are not at all satisfied with the destruction of the compromise an indorsement of this principle they proclaim to be the great object
with them
nebraska alone is a small matter to establish a principle for future use is what they particularly desire
the future use is to be the planting of slavery wherever in the wide world local and unorganized opposition cannot prevent it
if you wish to give them this indorsement
if you wish to establish this principle
do so
i shall regret it
but it is your right
on the contrary
if you are opposed to the principle
intend to give it no such indorsement
let no wheedling
no sophistry
divert you from throwing a direct vote against it
some men
mostly whigs
who condemn the repeal of the missouri compromise
nevertheless hesitate to go for its restoration
lest they be thrown in company with the abolitionists
will they allow me
as an old whig
to tell them
that i think this is very silly
stand with anybody that stands right
stand with him while he is right
and part with him when he goes wrong
stand with the abolitionist in restoring the missouri compromise
and stand against him when he attempts to repeal the fugitive slave law
in the latter case you stand with the southern disunionist
what of that
you are still right
in both cases you are right
in both cases you oppose the dangerous extremes
in both you stand on middle ground
and hold the ship level and steady
in both you are national
and nothing less than national
this is the good old whig ground
to desert such ground because of any company is to be less than a whig less than a man less than an american
i particularly object to the new position which the avowed principle of this nebraska law gives to slavery in the body politic
i object to it because it assumes that there can be moral right in the enslaving of one man by another
i object to it as a dangerous dalliance for a free people a sad evidence that
feeling prosperity
we forget right that liberty
as a principle
we have ceased to revere
i object to it because the fathers of the republic eschewed and rejected it
the argument of necessity was the only argument they ever admitted in favor of slavery and so far
and so far only
as it carried them did they ever go
they found the institution existing among us
which they could not help
and they cast blame upon the british king for having permitted its introduction
the royally appointed governor of georgia in the early 1700's was threatened by the king with removal if he continued to oppose slavery in his colony at that time the king of england made a small profit on every slave imported to the colonies
the later british criticism of the united states for not eradicating slavery in the early 1800's
combined with their tacit support of the 'confederacy' during the civil war is a prime example of the irony and hypocrisy of politics
that self interest will ever overpower right
before the constitution they prohibited its introduction into the northwestern territory
the only country we owned then free from it
at the framing and adoption of the constitution
they forbore to so much as mention the word slave or slavery in the whole instrument
in the provision for the recovery of fugitives
the slave is spoken of as a person held to service or labor
in that prohibiting the abolition of the african slave trade for twenty years
that trade is spoken of as the migration or importation of such persons as any of the states now existing shall think proper to admit
etc
these are the only provisions alluding to slavery
thus the thing is hid away in the constitution
just as an afflicted man hides away a wen or cancer which he dares not cut out at once
lest he bleed to death
with the promise
that the cutting may begin at a certain time
less than this our fathers could not do
and more they would not do
necessity drove them so far
and farther they would not go
but this is not all
the earliest congress under the constitution took the same view of slavery
they hedged and hemmed it in to the narrowest limits of necessity
in 1794 they prohibited an outgoing slave trade that is
the taking of slaves from the united states to sell
in 1798 they prohibited the bringing of slaves from africa into the mississippi territory
this territory then comprising what are now the states of mississippi and alabama
this was ten years before they had the authority to do the same thing as to the states existing at the adoption of the constitution
in 1800 they prohibited american citizens from trading in slaves between foreign countries
for instance
from africa to brazil
in 1803 they passed a law in aid of one or two slave state laws in restraint of the internal slave trade
in 1807
in apparent hot haste
they passed the law
nearly a year in advance
to take effect the first day of 1808
the very first day the constitution would permit
prohibiting the african slave trade by heavy pecuniary and corporal penalties
in 1820
finding these provisions ineffectual
they declared the slave trade piracy
and annexed to it the extreme penalty of death
while all this was passing in the general government
five or six of the original slave states had adopted systems of gradual emancipation
by which the institution was rapidly becoming extinct within their limits
thus we see that the plain
unmistakable spirit of that age toward slavery was hostility to the principle and toleration only by necessity
but now it is to be transformed into a sacred right
nebraska brings it forth
places it on the highroad to extension and perpetuity
and with a pat on its back says to it
and god speed you
henceforth it is to be the chief jewel of the nation the very figure head of the ship of state
little by little
but steadily as man's march to the grave
we have been giving up the old for the new faith
near eighty years ago we began by declaring that all men are created equal but now from that beginning we have run down to the other declaration
that for some men to enslave others is a sacred right of self government
these principles cannot stand together
they are as opposite as god and mammon and who ever holds to the one must despise the other
when pettit
in connection with his support of the nebraska bill
called the declaration of independence a self evident lie
he only did what consistency and candor require all other nebraska men to do
of the forty odd nebraska senators who sat present and heard him
no one rebuked him
nor am i apprised that any nebraska newspaper
or any nebraska orator
in the whole nation has ever yet rebuked him
if this had been said among marion's men
southerners though they were
what would have become of the man who said it
if this had been said to the men who captured andre
the man who said it would probably have been hung sooner than andre was
if it had been said in old independence hall seventy eight years ago
the very doorkeeper would have throttled the man and thrust him into the street
let no one be deceived
the spirit of seventy six and the spirit of nebraska are utter antagonisms and the former is being rapidly displaced by the latter
south as well as north
shall we make no effort to arrest this
already the liberal party throughout the world express the apprehension that the one retrograde institution in america is undermining the principles of progress
and fatally violating the noblest political system the world ever saw
this is not the taunt of enemies
but the warning of friends
is it quite safe to disregard it to despise it
is there no danger to liberty itself in discarding the earliest practice and first precept of our ancient faith
in our greedy chase to make profit of the negro
let us beware lest we cancel and tear in pieces even the white man's charter of freedom
our republican robe is soiled and trailed in the dust
let us repurify it
let us turn and wash it white in the spirit
if not the blood
of the revolution
let us turn slavery from its claims of moral right
back upon its existing legal rights and its arguments of necessity
let us return it to the position our fathers gave it
and there let it rest in peace
let us readopt the declaration of independence
and with it the practices and policy which harmonize with it
let north and south
let all americans let all lovers of liberty everywhere join in the great and good work
if we do this
we shall not only have saved the union
but we shall have so saved it as to make and to keep it forever worthy of the saving
we shall have so saved it that the succeeding millions of free happy people the world over shall rise up and call us blessed to the latest generations
at springfield
twelve days ago
where i had spoken substantially as i have here
judge douglas replied to me and as he is to reply to me here
i shall attempt to anticipate him by noticing some of the points he made there
he commenced by stating i had assumed all the way through that the principle of the nebraska bill would have the effect of extending slavery
he denied that this was intended or that this effect would follow
i will not reopen the argument upon this point
that such was the intention the world believed at the start
and will continue to believe
this was the countenance of the thing
and both friends and enemies instantly recognized it as such
that countenance cannot now be changed by argument
you can as easily argue the color out of the negro's skin
like the bloody hand
you may wash it and wash it
the red witness of guilt still sticks and stares horribly at you
next he says that congressional intervention never prevented slavery anywhere that it did not prevent it in the northwestern territory
nor in illinois that
in fact
illinois came into the union as a slave state that the principle of the nebraska bill expelled it from illinois
from several old states
from everywhere
now this is mere quibbling all the way through
if the ordinance of '87 did not keep slavery out of the northwest territory
how happens it that the northwest shore of the ohio river is entirely free from it
while the southeast shore
less than a mile distant
along nearly the whole length of the river
is entirely covered with it
if that ordinance did not keep it out of illinois
what was it that made the difference between illinois and missouri
they lie side by side
the mississippi river only dividing them
while their early settlements were within the same latitude
between 1810 and 1820 the number of slaves in missouri increased 7211
while in illinois in the same ten years they decreased 51
this appears by the census returns
during nearly all of that ten years both were territories
not states
during this time the ordinance forbade slavery to go into illinois
and nothing forbade it to go into missouri
it did go into missouri
and did not go into illinois
that is the fact
can any one doubt as to the reason of it
but he says illinois came into the union as a slave state
would be the best answer to this flat contradiction of the known history of the country
what are the facts upon which this bold assertion is based
when we first acquired the country
as far back as 1787
there were some slaves within it held by the french inhabitants of kaskaskia
the territorial legislation admitted a few negroes from the slave states as indentured servants
one year after the adoption of the first state constitution
the whole number of them was what do you think
just one hundred and seventeen
while the aggregate free population was 55
about four hundred and seventy to one
upon this state of facts the people framed their constitution prohibiting the further introduction of slavery
with a sort of guaranty to the owners of the few indentured servants
giving freedom to their children to be born thereafter
and making no mention whatever of any supposed slave for life
out of this small matter the judge manufactures his argument that illinois came into the union as a slave state
let the facts be the answer to the argument
the principles of the nebraska bill
he says
expelled slavery from illinois
the principle of that bill first planted it here that is
it first came because there was no law to prevent it
first came before we owned the country and finding it here
and having the ordinance of '87 to prevent its increasing
our people struggled along
and finally got rid of it as best they could
but the principle of the nebraska bill abolished slavery in several of the old states
it is true that several of the old states
in the last quarter of the last century
did adopt systems of gradual emancipation by which the institution has finally become extinct within their limits but it may or may not be true that the principle of the nebraska bill was the cause that led to the adoption of these measures
it is now more than fifty years since the last of these states adopted its system of emancipation
if the nebraska bill is the real author of the benevolent works
it is rather deplorable that it has for so long a time ceased working altogether
is there not some reason to suspect that it was the principle of the revolution
and not the principle of the nebraska bill
that led to emancipation in these old states
leave it to the people of these old emancipating states
and i am quite certain they will decide that neither that nor any other good thing ever did or ever will come of the nebraska bill
in the course of my main argument
judge douglas interrupted me to say that the principle of the nebraska bill was very old that it originated when god made man
and placed good and evil before him
allowing him to choose for himself
being responsible for the choice he should make
at the time i thought this was merely playful
and i answered it accordingly
but in his reply to me he renewed it as a serious argument
in seriousness
the facts of this proposition are not true as stated
god did not place good and evil before man
telling him to make his choice
on the contrary
he did tell him there was one tree of the fruit of which he should not eat
upon pain of certain death
i should scarcely wish so strong a prohibition against slavery in nebraska
but this argument strikes me as not a little remarkable in another particular in its strong resemblance to the old argument for the divine right of kings
by the latter
the king is to do just as he pleases with his white subjects
being responsible to god alone
by the former
the white man is to do just as he pleases with his black slaves
being responsible to god alone
the two things are precisely alike
and it is but natural that they should find similar arguments to sustain them
i had argued that the application of the principle of self government
as contended for
would require the revival of the african slave trade that no argument could be made in favor of a man's right to take slaves to nebraska which could not be equally well made in favor of his right to bring them from the coast of africa
the judge replied that the constitution requires the suppression of the foreign slave trade
but does not require the prohibition of slavery in the territories
that is a mistake in point of fact
the constitution does not require the action of congress in either case
and it does authorize it in both
and so there is still no difference between the cases
in regard to what i have said of the advantage the slave states have over the free in the matter of representation
the judge replied that we in the free states count five free negroes as five white people
while in the slave states they count five slaves as three whites only and that the advantage
at last
was on the side of the free states
in the slave states they count free negroes just as we do and it so happens that
besides their slaves
they have as many free negroes as we have
and thirty thousand over
their free negroes more than balance ours and their advantage over us
in consequence of their slaves
still remains as i stated it
in reply to my argument that the compromise measures of 1850 were a system of equivalents
and that the provisions of no one of them could fairly be carried to other subjects without its corresponding equivalent being carried with it
the judge denied outright that these measures had any connection with or dependence upon each other
this is mere desperation
if they had no connection
why are they always spoken of in connection
why has he so spoken of them a thousand times
why has he constantly called them a series of measures
why does everybody call them a compromise
why was california kept out of the union six or seven months
if it was not because of its connection with the other measures
webster's leading definition of the verb to compromise is to adjust and settle a difference
by mutual agreement
with concessions of claims by the parties
this conveys precisely the popular understanding of the word compromise
we knew
before the judge told us
that these measures passed separately
and in distinct bills
and that no two of them were passed by the votes of precisely the same members
but we also know
and so does he know
that no one of them could have passed both branches of congress but for the understanding that the others were to pass also
upon this understanding
each got votes which it could have got in no other way
it is this fact which gives to the measures their true character and it is the universal knowledge of this fact that has given them the name of compromises
so expressive of that true character
i had asked
in carrying the utah and new mexico laws to nebraska
you could clear away other objection
how could you leave nebraska 'perfectly free' to introduce slavery before she forms a constitution
during her territorial government
while the utah and new mexico laws only authorize it when they form constitutions and are admitted into the union
to this judge douglas answered that the utah and new mexico laws also authorized it before and to prove this he read from one of their laws
as follows
that the legislative power of said territory shall extend to all rightful subjects of legislation
consistent with the constitution of the united states and the provisions of this act
now it is perceived from the reading of this that there is nothing express upon the subject
but that the authority is sought to be implied merely for the general provision of all rightful subjects of legislation
in reply to this i insist
as a legal rule of construction
as well as the plain
popular view of the matter
that the express provision for utah and new mexico coming in with slavery
if they choose
when they shall form constitutions
is an exclusion of all implied authority on the same subject that congress having the subject distinctly in their minds when they made the express provision
they therein expressed their whole meaning on that subject
the judge rather insinuated that i had found it convenient to forget the washington territorial law passed in 1853
this was a division of oregon
organizing the northern part as the territory of washington
he asserted that by this act the ordinance of '87
theretofore existing in oregon
was repealed that nearly all the members of congress voted for it
beginning in the house of representatives with charles allen of massachusetts
and ending with richard yates of illinois and that he could not understand how those who now opposed the nebraska bill so voted there
unless it was because it was then too soon after both the great political parties had ratified the compromises of 1850
and the ratification therefore was too fresh to be then repudiated
now i had seen the washington act before
and i have carefully examined it since and i aver that there is no repeal of the ordinance of '87
or of any prohibition of slavery
in it
in express terms
there is absolutely nothing in the whole law upon the subject in fact
nothing to lead a reader to think of the subject
to my judgment it is equally free from everything from which repeal can be legally implied but
however this may be
are men now to be entrapped by a legal implication
extracted from covert language
introduced perhaps for the very purpose of entrapping them
i sincerely wish every man could read this law quite through
carefully watching every sentence and every line for a repeal of the ordinance of '87
or anything equivalent to it
another point on the washington act
if it was intended to be modeled after the utah and new mexico acts
as judge douglas insists
why was it not inserted in it
as in them
that washington was to come in with or without slavery as she may choose at the adoption of her constitution
it has no such provision in it and i defy the ingenuity of man to give a reason for the omission
other than that it was not intended to follow the utah and new mexico laws in regard to the question of slavery
the washington act not only differs vitally from the utah and new mexico acts
but the nebraska act differs vitally from both
by the latter act the people are left perfectly free to regulate their own domestic concerns
but in all the former
all their laws are to be submitted to congress
and if disapproved are to be null
the washington act goes even further it absolutely prohibits the territorial legislature
by very strong and guarded language
from establishing banks or borrowing money on the faith of the territory
is this the sacred right of self government we hear vaunted so much
sir the nebraska bill finds no model in the acts of '50 or the washington act
it finds no model in any law from adam till to day
as phillips says of napoleon
the nebraska act is grand
gloomy and peculiar
wrapped in the solitude of its own originality
without a model and without a shadow upon the earth
in the course of his reply senator douglas remarked in substance that he had always considered this government was made for the white people and not for the negroes
in point of mere fact
i think so too
but in this remark of the judge there is a significance which i think is the key to the great mistake if there is any such mistake which he has made in this nebraska measure
it shows that the judge has no very vivid impression that the negro is human
and consequently has no idea that there can be any moral question in legislating about him
in his view the question of whether a new country shall be slave or free is a matter of as utter indifference as it is whether his neighbor shall plant his farm with tobacco or stock it with horned cattle
whether this view is right or wrong
it is very certain that the great mass of mankind take a totally different view
they consider slavery a great moral wrong
and their feeling against it is not evanescent
but eternal
it lies at the very foundation of their sense of justice
and it cannot be trifled with
it is a great and durable element of popular action
and i think no statesman can safely disregard it
our senator also objects that those who oppose him in this matter do not entirely agree with one another
he reminds me that in my firm adherence to the constitutional rights of the slave states i differ widely from others who are cooperating with me in opposing the nebraska bill
and he says it is not quite fair to oppose him in this variety of ways
he should remember that he took us by surprise astounded us by this measure
we were thunderstruck and stunned
and we reeled and fell in utter confusion
but we rose
each fighting
grasping whatever he could first reach a scythe
a pitchfork
a chopping ax
or a butcher's cleaver
we struck in the direction of the sound
and we were rapidly closing in upon him
he must not think to divert us from our purpose by showing us that our drill
our dress
and our weapons are not entirely perfect and uniform
when the storm shall be past he shall find us still americans
no less devoted to the continued union and prosperity of the country than heretofore
the judge invokes against me the memory of clay and webster
they were great men
and men of great deeds
but where have i assailed them
for what is it that their lifelong enemy shall now make profit by assuming to defend them against me
their lifelong friend
i go against the repeal of the missouri compromise did they ever go for it
they went for the compromise of 1850 did i ever go against them
they were greatly devoted to the union to the small measure of my ability was i ever less so
clay and webster were dead before this question arose by what authority shall our senator say they would espouse his side of it if alive
clay was the leading spirit in making the missouri compromise is it very credible that if now alive he would take the lead in the breaking of it
the truth is that some support from whigs is now a necessity with the judge
and for this it is that the names of clay and webster are invoked
his old friends have deserted him in such numbers as to leave too few to live by
he came to his own
and his own received him not and lo
he turns unto the gentiles
a word now as to the judge's desperate assumption that the compromises of 1850 had no connection with one another that illinois came into the union as a slave state
and some other similar ones
this is no other than a bold denial of the history of the country
if we do not know that the compromises of 1850 were dependent on each other if we do not know that illinois came into the union as a free state
we do not know anything
if we do not know these things
we do not know that we ever had a revolutionary war or such a chief as washington
to deny these things is to deny our national axioms
or dogmas
at least
and it puts an end to all argument
if a man will stand up and assert
and repeat and reassert
that two and two do not make four
i know nothing in the power of argument that can stop him
i think i can answer the judge so long as he sticks to the premises but when he flies from them
i cannot work any argument into the consistency of a mental gag and actually close his mouth with it
in such a case i can only commend him to the seventy thousand answers just in from pennsylvania
and indiana

be elected to the united states senate
and i want the chance of being the man
you are a member of the legislature
and have a vote to give
think it over
and see whether you can do better than to go for me

dear sir
i have really got it into my head to try to be united states senator
if i could have your support
my chances would be reasonably good
but i know
and acknowledge
that you have as just claims to the place as i have and therefore i cannot ask you to yield to me
if you are thinking of becoming a candidate
you are not
then i should like to be remembered affectionately by you and also to have you make a mark for me with the anti nebraska members down your way
if you know
and have no objection to tell
let me know whether trumbull intends to make a push
if he does
i suppose the two men in st

will be for him
we have the legislature

on joint ballot
but the senate is very close
and cullom told me to day that the nebraska men will stave off the election
if they can
even if we get into joint vote
we shall have difficulty to unite our forces

in the contingency of his removal
i have recommended william butler as his successor
and i do not wish what i write now to be taken as any abatement of that recommendation
william j
black is also an applicant for the appointment
and i write this at the solicitation of his friends to say that he is every way worthy of the office
and that i doubt not the conferring it upon him will give great satisfaction

dear sir
yours of the 11th was received last night
and for which i thank you
of course i prefer myself to all others yet it is neither in my heart nor my conscience to say i am any better man than mr
we shall have a terrible struggle with our adversaries
they are desperate and bent on desperate deeds
i accidentally learned of one of the leaders here writing to a member south of here
in about the following language
we are beaten
they have a clean majority of at least nine
on joint ballot
they outnumber us
but we must outmanage them
douglas must be sustained
we must elect the speaker and we must elect a nebraska united states senator
or elect none at all
similar letters
no doubt
are written to every nebraska member
be considering how we can best meet
and foil
and beat them
i send you
by mail
a copy of my peoria speech
you may have seen it before
or you may not think it worth seeing now
do not speak of the nebraska letter mentioned above i do not wish it to become public
that i received such information
yours truly
1855 loss of primary for senator to e
february 9
1855 my dear sir
i began with 44 votes
shields 41
and trumbull 5
yet trumbull was elected
in fact 47 different members voted for me
getting three new ones on the second ballot
and losing four old ones
how came my 47 to yield to trumbull's 5
it was governor matteson's work
he has been secretly a candidate ever since before
even the fall election
all the members round about the canal were anti nebraska
but were nevertheless nearly all democrats and old personal friends of his
his plan was to privately impress them with the belief that he was as good anti nebraska as any one else at least could be secured to be so by instructions
which could be easily passed
the nebraska men
of course
were not for matteson but when they found they could elect no avowed nebraska man
they tardily determined to let him get whomever of our men he could
by whatever means he could
and ask him no questions
the nebraska men were very confident of the election of matteson
though denying that he was a candidate
and we very much believing also that they would elect him
but they wanted first to make a show of good faith to shields by voting for him a few times
and our secret matteson men also wanted to make a show of good faith by voting with us a few times
so we led off
on the seventh ballot
i think
the signal was given to the nebraska men to turn to matteson
which they acted on to a man
with one exception
next ballot the remaining nebraska man and one pretended anti went over to him
giving him 46
the next still another
giving him 47
wanting only three of an election
in the meantime our friends
with a view of detaining our expected bolters
had been turning from me to trumbull till he had risen to 35 and i had been reduced to 15
these would never desert me except by my direction but i became satisfied that if we could prevent matteson's election one or two ballots more
we could not possibly do so a single ballot after my friends should begin to return to me from trumbull
so i determined to strike at once
and accordingly advised my remaining friends to go for him
which they did and elected him on the tenth ballot
such is the way the thing was done
i think you would have done the same under the circumstances
i could have headed off every combination and been elected
had it not been for matteson's double game and his defeat now gives me more pleasure than my own gives me pain
on the whole
it is perhaps as well for our general cause that trumbull is elected
the nebraska men confess that they hate it worse than anything that could have happened
it is a great consolation to see them worse whipped than i am
yours forever

my dear sir
your letter to judge logan has been shown to us by him and
with his consent
we answer it
when it became probable that there would be a vacancy on the supreme bench
public opinion
on this side of the river
seemed to be universally directed to logan as the proper man to fill it
i mean public opinion on our side in politics
with very small manifestation in any different direction by the other side
the result is
that he has been a good deal pressed to allow his name to be used
and he has consented to it
provided it can be done with perfect cordiality and good feeling on the part of all our own friends
the undersigned
are very anxious for it and the more so now that he has been urged
until his mind is turned upon the matter
therefore are very glad of your letter
with the information it brings us
mixed only with a regret that we can not elect logan and walker both
we shall be glad
if you will hoist logan's name
in your quincy papers
very truly your friends
john t

june 7
my dear sir
your note containing election news is received and for which i thank you
it is all of no use
logan is worse beaten than any other man ever was since elections were invented beaten more than twelve hundred in this county
it is conceded on all hands that the prohibitory law is also beaten

response to a pro slavery friend to joshua
august 24
1855 dear speed
you know what a poor correspondent i am
ever since i received your very agreeable letter of the 22d of may
i have been intending to write you an answer to it
you suggest that in political action
you and i would differ
i suppose we would not quite as much
as you may think
you know i dislike slavery
and you fully admit the abstract wrong of it
so far there is no cause of difference
but you say that sooner than yield your legal right to the slave
especially at the bidding of those who are not themselves interested
you would see the union dissolved
i am not aware that any one is bidding you yield that right very certainly i am not
i leave that matter entirely to yourself
i also acknowledge your rights and my obligations under the constitution in regard to your slaves
i confess i hate to see the poor creatures hunted down and caught and carried back to their stripes and unrequited toil but i bite my lips and keep quiet
in 1841 you and i had together a tedious low water trip on a steamboat from louisville to st
you may remember
as i well do
that from louisville to the mouth of the ohio there were on board ten or a dozen slaves shackled together with irons
that sight was a continued torment to me
and i see something like it every time i touch the ohio or any other slave border
it is not fair for you to assume that i have no interest in a thing which has
and continually exercises
the power of making me miserable
you ought rather to appreciate how much the great body of the northern people do crucify their feelings
in order to maintain their loyalty to the constitution and the union
i do oppose the extension of slavery because my judgment and feeling so prompt me
and i am under no obligations to the contrary
if for this you and i must differ
differ we must
you say
if you were president
you would send an army and hang the leaders of the missouri outrages upon the kansas elections still
if kansas fairly votes herself a slave state she must be admitted or the union must be dissolved
but how if she votes herself a slave state unfairly
that is
by the very means for which you say you would hang men
must she still be admitted
or the union dissolved
that will be the phase of the question when it first becomes a practical one
in your assumption that there may be a fair decision of the slavery question in kansas
i plainly see you and i would differ about the nebraska law
i look upon that enactment not as a law
but as a violence from the beginning
it was conceived in violence
is maintained in violence
and is being executed in violence
i say it was conceived in violence
because the destruction of the missouri compromise
under the circumstances
was nothing less than violence
it was passed in violence because it could not have passed at all but for the votes of many members in violence of the known will of their constituents
it is maintained in violence
because the elections since clearly demand its repeal and the demand is openly disregarded
you say men ought to be hung for the way they are executing the law i say the way it is being executed is quite as good as any of its antecedents
it is being executed in the precise way which was intended from the first
else why does no nebraska man express astonishment or condemnation
poor reeder is the only public man who has been silly enough to believe that anything like fairness was ever intended
and he has been bravely undeceived
that kansas will form a slave constitution
and with it will ask to be admitted into the union
i take to be already a settled question
and so settled by the very means you so pointedly condemn
by every principle of law ever held by any court north or south
every negro taken to kansas is free yet
in utter disregard of this
in the spirit of violence merely
that beautiful legislature gravely passes a law to hang any man who shall venture to inform a negro of his legal rights
this is the subject and real object of the law
like haman
they should hang upon the gallows of their own building
i shall not be among the mourners for their fate
in my humble sphere
i shall advocate the restoration of the missouri compromise so long as kansas remains a territory
and when
by all these foul means
it seeks to come into the union as a slave state
i shall oppose it
i am very loath in any case to withhold my assent to the enjoyment of property acquired or located in good faith but i do not admit that good faith in taking a negro to kansas to be held in slavery is a probability with any man
any man who has sense enough to be the controller of his own property has too much sense to misunderstand the outrageous character of the whole nebraska business
but i digress
in my opposition to the admission of kansas i shall have some company
but we may be beaten
if we are
i shall not on that account attempt to dissolve the union
i think it probable
we shall be beaten
standing as a unit among yourselves
you can
directly and indirectly
bribe enough of our men to carry the day
as you could on the open proposition to establish a monarchy
get hold of some man in the north whose position and ability is such that he can make the support of your measure
whatever it may be
a democratic party necessity
and the thing is done
apropos of this
let me tell you an anecdote
douglas introduced the nebraska bill in january
in february afterward there was a called session of the illinois legislature
of the one hundred members composing the two branches of that body
about seventy were democrats
these latter held a caucus in which the nebraska bill was talked of
if not formally discussed
it was thereby discovered that just three
and no more
were in favor of the measure
in a day or two douglas's orders came on to have resolutions passed approving the bill and they were passed by large majorities
the truth of this is vouched for by a bolting democratic member
the masses
democratic as well as whig
were even nearer unanimous against it but
as soon as the party necessity of supporting it became apparent
the way the democrats began to see the wisdom and justice of it was perfectly astonishing
you say that if kansas fairly votes herself a free state
as a christian you will rejoice at it
all decent slaveholders talk that way
and i do not doubt their candor
but they never vote that way
although in a private letter or conversation you will express your preference that kansas shall be free
you would vote for no man for congress who would say the same thing publicly
no such man could be elected from any district in a slave state
you think stringfellow and company ought to be hung and yet at the next presidential election you will vote for the exact type and representative of stringfellow
the slave breeders and slave traders are a small
and detested class among you and yet in politics they dictate the course of all of you
and are as completely your masters as you are the master of your own negroes
you inquire where i now stand
that is a disputed point
i think i am a whig but others say there are no whigs
and that i am an abolitionist
when i was at washington
i voted for the wilmot proviso as good as forty times and i never heard of any one attempting to un whig me for that
i now do no more than oppose the extension of slavery
i am not a know nothing that is certain
how could i be
how can any one who abhors the oppression of negroes be in favor of degrading classes of white people
our progress in degeneracy appears to me to be pretty rapid
as a nation we began by declaring that all men are created equal
we now practically read it all men are created equal
except negroes
when the know nothings get control
it will read all men are created equal
except negroes and foreigners and catholics
when it comes to this
i shall prefer emigrating to some country where they make no pretense of loving liberty
to russia
for instance
where despotism can be taken pure
and without the base alloy of hypocrisy
mary will probably pass a day or two in louisville in october
my kindest regards to mrs
on the leading subject of this letter i have more of her sympathy than i have of yours and yet let me say i am
your friend forever

says tom to john
here's your old rotten wheelbarrow
i've broke it usin' on it
i wish you would mend it
case i shall want to borrow it this arternoon
acting on this as a precedent
i say
here's your old 'chalked hat
i wish you would take it and send me a new one
case i shall want to use it the first of march
yours truly
a 'chalked hat' was the common term
at that time
for a railroad pass
speech delivered before the first republican state convention of illinois
held at bloomington
on may 29
from the report by william c
mr
whitney's notes were made at the time
but not written out until 1896
he does not claim that the speech
as here reported
is literally correct only that he has followed the argument
and that in many cases the sentences are as mr
lincoln spoke them
mr
chairman and gentlemen
i was over at cries of platform
take the platform
i say
that while i was at danville court
some of our friends of anti nebraska got together in springfield and elected me as one delegate to represent old sangamon with them in this convention
and i am here certainly as a sympathizer in this movement and by virtue of that meeting and selection
but we can hardly be called delegates strictly
inasmuch as
properly speaking
we represent nobody but ourselves
i think it altogether fair to say that we have no anti nebraska party in sangamon
although there is a good deal of anti nebraska feeling there but i say for myself
and i think i may speak also for my colleagues
that we who are here fully approve of the platform and of all that has been done a voice
and even if we are not regularly delegates
it will be right for me to answer your call to speak
i suppose we truly stand for the public sentiment of sangamon on the great question of the repeal
although we do not yet represent many numbers who have taken a distinct position on the question
we are in a trying time it ranges above mere party and this movement to call a halt and turn our steps backward needs all the help and good counsels it can get for unless popular opinion makes itself very strongly felt
and a change is made in our present course
blood will flow on account of nebraska
and brother's hands will be raised against brother
the last sentence was uttered in such an earnest
if not
as to make a cold chill creep over me
others gave a similar experience
i have listened with great interest to the earnest appeal made to illinois men by the gentleman from lawrence james s
emery who has just addressed us so eloquently and forcibly
i was deeply moved by his statement of the wrongs done to free state men out there
i think it just to say that all true men north should sympathize with them
and ought to be willing to do any possible and needful thing to right their wrongs
but we must not promise what we ought not
lest we be called on to perform what we cannot we must be calm and moderate
and consider the whole difficulty
and determine what is possible and just
we must not be led by excitement and passion to do that which our sober judgments would not approve in our cooler moments
we have higher aims we will have more serious business than to dally with temporary measures
we are here to stand firmly for a principle to stand firmly for a right
we know that great political and moral wrongs are done
and outrages committed
and we denounce those wrongs and outrages
although we cannot
at present
do much more
but we desire to reach out beyond those personal outrages and establish a rule that will apply to all
and so prevent any future outrages
we have seen to day that every shade of popular opinion is represented here
with freedom
or rather free soil
as the basis
we have come together as in some sort representatives of popular opinion against the extension of slavery into territory now free in fact as well as by law
and the pledged word of the statesmen of the nation who are now no more
we come we are here assembled together to protest as well as we can against a great wrong
and to take measures
as well as we now can
to make that wrong right to place the nation
as far as it may be possible now
as it was before the repeal of the missouri compromise and the plain way to do this is to restore the compromise
and to demand and determine that kansas shall be free
immense applause
while we affirm
and reaffirm
if necessary
our devotion to the principles of the declaration of independence
let our practical work here be limited to the above
we know that there is not a perfect agreement of sentiment here on the public questions which might be rightfully considered in this convention
and that the indignation which we all must feel cannot be helped but all of us must give up something for the good of the cause
there is one desire which is uppermost in the mind
one wish common to us all
to which no dissent will be made and i counsel you earnestly to bury all resentment
to sink all personal feeling
make all things work to a common purpose in which we are united and agreed about
and which all present will agree is absolutely necessary which must be done by any rightful mode if there be such
slavery must be kept out of kansas
the test the pinch is right there
if we lose kansas to freedom
an example will be set which will prove fatal to freedom in the end
in the language of the bible
must lay the axe to the root of the tree
temporizing will not do longer now is the time for decision for firm
resolute action
the nebraska bill
or rather nebraska law
is not one of wholesome legislation
but was and is an act of legislative usurpation
whose result
if not indeed intention
is to make slavery national and unless headed off in some effective way
we are in a fair way to see this land of boasted freedom converted into a land of slavery in fact
just open your two eyes
and see if this be not so
i need do no more than state
to command universal approval
that almost the entire north
as well as a large following in the border states
is radically opposed to the planting of slavery in free territory
probably in a popular vote throughout the nation nine tenths of the voters in the free states
and at least one half in the border states
if they could express their sentiments freely
would vote no on such an issue and it is safe to say that two thirds of the votes of the entire nation would be opposed to it
and yet
in spite of this overbalancing of sentiment in this free country
we are in a fair way to see kansas present itself for admission as a slave state
it is a felony
by the local law of kansas
to deny that slavery exists there even now
by every principle of law
a negro in kansas is free yet the bogus legislature makes it an infamous crime to tell him that he is free
statutes of kansas
chapter 151
if any free person
by speaking or by writing
assert or maintain that persons have not the right to hold slaves in this territory
or shall introduce into this territory
any book
or circular containing any denial of the right of persons to hold slaves in this territory such person shall be deemed guilty of felony
and punished by imprisonment at hard labor for a term of not less than two years
no person who is conscientiously opposed to holding slaves
or who does not admit the right to hold slaves in this territory
shall sit as a juror on the trial of any prosecution for any violation of any sections of this act
the party lash and the fear of ridicule will overawe justice and liberty for it is a singular fact
but none the less a fact
and well known by the most common experience
that men will do things under the terror of the party lash that they would not on any account or for any consideration do otherwise while men who will march up to the mouth of a loaded cannon without shrinking will run from the terrible name of abolitionist
even when pronounced by a worthless creature whom they
with good reason
for instance to press this point a little judge douglas introduced his nebraska bill in january and we had an extra session of our legislature in the succeeding february
in which were seventy five democrats and at a party caucus
fully attended
there were just three votes
out of the whole seventy five
for the measure
but in a few days orders came on from washington
commanding them to approve the measure the party lash was applied
and it was brought up again in caucus
and passed by a large majority
the masses were against it
but party necessity carried it and it was passed through the lower house of congress against the will of the people
for the same reason
here is where the greatest danger lies that
while we profess to be a government of law and reason
law will give way to violence on demand of this awful and crushing power
like the great juggernaut i think that is the name the great idol
it crushes everything that comes in its way
and makes a
as i read once
in a blackletter law book
a slave is a human being who is legally not a person but a thing
and if the safeguards to liberty are broken down
as is now attempted
when they have made things of all the free negroes
how long
think you
before they will begin to make things of poor white men
be not deceived
revolutions do not go backward
the founder of the democratic party declared that all men were created equal
his successor in the leadership has written the word white before men
making it read all white men are created equal
pray
will or may not the know nothings
if they should get in power
add the word protestant
making it read all protestant white men
meanwhile the hapless negro is the fruitful subject of reprisals in other quarters
john pettit
whom tom benton paid his respects to
you will recollect
calls the immortal declaration a self evident lie while at the birthplace of freedom in the shadow of bunker hill and of the cradle of liberty
at the home of the adamses and warren and otis choate
from our side of the house
dares to fritter away the birthday promise of liberty by proclaiming the declaration to be a string of glittering generalities and the southern whigs
working hand in hand with proslavery democrats
are making choate's theories practical
thomas jefferson
a slaveholder
mindful of the moral element in slavery
solemnly declared that he trembled for his country when he remembered that god is just while judge douglas
with an insignificant wave of the hand
don't care whether slavery is voted up or voted down
now
if slavery is right
or even negative
he has a right to treat it in this trifling manner
but if it is a moral and political wrong
as all christendom considers it to be
how can he answer to god for this attempt to spread and fortify it
but no man
and judge douglas no more than any other
can maintain a negative
or merely neutral
position on this question and
he avows that the union was made by white men and for white men and their descendants
as matter of fact
the first branch of the proposition is historically true the government was made by white men
and they were and are the superior race
this i admit
but the corner stone of the government
so to speak
was the declaration that all men are created equal
and all entitled to life
and the pursuit of happiness
applause
and not only so
but the framers of the constitution were particular to keep out of that instrument the word slave
the reason being that slavery would ultimately come to an end
and they did not wish to have any reminder that in this free country human beings were ever prostituted to slavery
nor is it any argument that we are superior and the negro inferior that he has but one talent while we have ten
let the negro possess the little he has in independence if he has but one talent
he should be permitted to keep the little he has
but slavery will endure no test of reason or logic and yet its advocates
like douglas
use a sort of bastard logic
or noisy assumption it might better be termed
like the above
in order to prepare the mind for the gradual
but none the less certain
encroachments of the moloch of slavery upon the fair domain of freedom
but however much you may argue upon it
or smother it in soft phrase
slavery can only be maintained by force by violence
the repeal of the missouri compromise was by violence
it was a violation of both law and the sacred obligations of honor
to overthrow and trample under foot a solemn compromise
obtained by the fearful loss to freedom of one of the fairest of our western domains
congress violated the will and confidence of its constituents in voting for the bill and while public sentiment
as shown by the elections of 1854
demanded the restoration of this compromise
congress violated its trust by refusing simply because it had the force of numbers to hold on to it
and murderous violence is being used now
in order to force slavery on to kansas for it cannot be done in any other way
the necessary result was to establish the rule of violence force
instead of the rule of law and reason to perpetuate and spread slavery
and in time to make it general
we see it at both ends of the line
in washington
on the very spot where the outrage was started
the fearless sumner is beaten to insensibility
and is now slowly dying while senators who claim to be gentlemen and christians stood by
countenancing the act
and even applauding it afterward in their places in the senate
even douglas
our man
saw it all and was within helping distance
yet let the murderous blows fall unopposed
at the other end of the line
at the very time sumner was being murdered
lawrence was being destroyed for the crime of freedom
it was the most prominent stronghold of liberty in kansas
and must give way to the all dominating power of slavery
only two days ago
judge trumbull found it necessary to propose a bill in the senate to prevent a general civil war and to restore peace in kansas
we live in the midst of alarms anxiety beclouds the future we expect some new disaster with each newspaper we read
are we in a healthful political state
are not the tendencies plain
do not the signs of the times point plainly the way in which we are going
in the early days of the constitution slavery was recognized
by south and north alike
as an evil
and the division of sentiment about it was not controlled by geographical lines or considerations of climate
but by moral and philanthropic views
petitions for the abolition of slavery were presented to the very first congress by virginia and massachusetts alike
to show the harmony which prevailed
i will state that a fugitive slave law was passed in 1793
with no dissenting voice in the senate
and but seven dissenting votes in the house
it was
a wise law
under the constitution
a just one
twenty five years later
a more stringent law was proposed and defeated and thirty five years after that
the present law
drafted by mason of virginia
was passed by northern votes
i am not
just now
complaining of this law
but i am trying to show how the current sets for the proposed law of 1817 was far less offensive than the present one
in 1774 the continental congress pledged itself
without a dissenting vote
to wholly discontinue the slave trade
and to neither purchase nor import any slave and less than three months before the passage of the declaration of independence
the same congress which adopted that declaration unanimously resolved that no slave be imported into any of the thirteen united colonies
great applause
on the second day of july
the draft of a declaration of independence was reported to congress by the committee
and in it the slave trade was characterized as an execrable commerce
as a piratical warfare
as the opprobrium of infidel powers
and as a cruel war against human nature
applause
all agreed on this except south carolina and georgia
and in order to preserve harmony
and from the necessity of the case
these expressions were omitted
abolition societies existed as far south as virginia and it is a well known fact that washington
and pendleton were qualified abolitionists
and much more radical on that subject than we of the whig and democratic parties claim to be to day
on march 1
virginia ceded to the confederation all its lands lying northwest of the ohio river
chase of maryland
and howell of rhode island
as a committee on that and territory thereafter to be ceded
reported that no slavery should exist after the year 1800
had this report been adopted
not only the northwest
but kentucky
and mississippi also would have been free but it required the assent of nine states to ratify it
north carolina was divided
and thus its vote was lost and delaware
and new jersey refused to vote
in point of fact
as it was
it was assented to by six states
three years later on a square vote to exclude slavery from the northwest
only one vote
and that from new york
was against it
and yet
thirty seven years later
five thousand citizens of illinois
out of a voting mass of less than twelve thousand
after a long and heated contest
voted to introduce slavery in illinois and
a large party in the free state of illinois are willing to vote to fasten the shackles of slavery on the fair domain of kansas
notwithstanding it received the dowry of freedom long before its birth as a political community
i repeat
the question
is it not plain in what direction we are tending
in the colonial time
and jefferson were as hostile to slavery in virginia as otis
and the adamses were in massachusetts and virginia made as earnest an effort to get rid of it as old massachusetts did
but circumstances were against them and they failed but not that the good will of its leading men was lacking
yet within less than fifty years virginia changed its tune
and made negro breeding for the cotton and sugar states one of its leading industries
laughter and applause
in the constitutional convention
george mason of virginia made a more violent abolition speech than my friends lovejoy or codding would desire to make here to day a speech which could not be safely repeated anywhere on southern soil in this enlightened year
while there were some differences of opinion on this subject even then
discussion was allowed but as you see by the kansas slave code
as you know
is the missouri slave code
merely ferried across the river
it is a felony to even express an opinion hostile to that foul blot in the land of washington and the declaration of independence
in kentucky my state in 1849
on a test vote
the mighty influence of henry clay and many other good then there could not get a symptom of expression in favor of gradual emancipation on a plain issue of marching toward the light of civilization with ohio and illinois but the state of boone and hardin and henry clay
with a nigger under each arm
took the black trail toward the deadly swamps of barbarism
is there can there be any doubt about this thing
and is there any doubt that we must all lay aside our prejudices and march
shoulder to shoulder
in the great army of freedom
every fourth of july our young orators all proclaim this to be the land of the free and the home of the brave
well
when you orators get that off next year
may be
this very year
how would you like some old grizzled farmer to get up in the grove and deny it
how would you like that
but suppose kansas comes in as a slave state
and all the border ruffians have barbecues about it
and free state men come trailing back to the dishonored north
like whipped dogs with their tails between their legs
it is ain't it
evident that this is no more the land of the free and if we let it go so
we won't dare to say home of the brave out loud
sensation and confusion
can any man doubt that
even in spite of the people's will
slavery will triumph through violence
unless that will be made manifest and enforced
even governor reeder claimed at the outset that the contest in kansas was to be fair
but he got his eyes open at last and i believe that
as a result of this moral and physical violence
kansas will soon apply for admission as a slave state
and yet we can't mistake that the people don't want it so
and that it is a land which is free both by natural and political law
no law
is free law
such is the understanding of all christendom
in the somerset case
decided nearly a century ago
the great lord mansfield held that slavery was of such a nature that it must take its rise in positive as distinguished from natural law and that in no country or age could it be traced back to any other source
will some one please tell me where is the positive law that establishes slavery in kansas
a voice
the bogus laws
aye
the bogus laws
on the same principle
a gang of missouri horse thieves could come into illinois and declare horse stealing to be legal laughter
and it would be just as legal as slavery is in kansas
but by express statute
in the land of washington and jefferson
we may soon be brought face to face with the discreditable fact of showing to the world by our acts that we prefer slavery to freedom darkness to light
it is
i believe
a principle in law that when one party to a contract violates it so grossly as to chiefly destroy the object for which it is made
the other party may rescind it
i will ask browning if that ain't good law
well
now if that be right
i go for rescinding the whole
entire missouri compromise and thus turning missouri into a free state and i should like to know the difference should like for any one to point out the difference between our making a free state of missouri and their making a slave state of kansas
great applause
there ain't one bit of difference
except that our way would be a great mercy to humanity
but i have never said
and the whig party has never said
and those who oppose the nebraska bill do not as a body say
that they have any intention of interfering with slavery in the slave states
our platform says just the contrary
we allow slavery to exist in the slave states
not because slavery is right or good
but from the necessities of our union
we grant a fugitive slave law because it is so nominated in the bond because our fathers so stipulated had to and we are bound to carry out this agreement
but they did not agree to introduce slavery in regions where it did not previously exist
on the contrary
they said by their example and teachings that they did not deem it expedient did n't consider it right to do so and it is wise and right to do just as they did about it
and that it what we propose not to interfere with slavery where it exists we have never tried to do it
and to give them a reasonable and efficient fugitive slave law
a voice
i say yes
it was part of the bargain
and i 'm for living up to it but i go no further i'm not bound to do more
and i won't agree any further
great applause
we
here in illinois
should feel especially proud of the provision of the missouri compromise excluding slavery from what is now kansas for an illinois man
jesse b
was its father
henry clay
who is credited with the authorship of the compromise in general terms
did not even vote for that provision
but only advocated the ultimate admission by a second compromise and thomas was
beyond all controversy
the real author of the slavery restriction branch of the compromise
to show the generosity of the northern members toward the southern side
on a test vote to exclude slavery from missouri
ninety voted not to exclude
and eighty seven to exclude
every vote from the slave states being ranged with the former and fourteen votes from the free states
of whom seven were from new england alone while on a vote to exclude slavery from what is now kansas
the vote was one hundred and thirty four for
to forty two against
the scheme
as a whole
of course
a southern triumph
it is idle to contend otherwise
as is now being done by the nebraskites it was so shown by the votes and quite as emphatically by the expressions of representative men
lowndes of south carolina was never known to commit a political mistake his was the great judgment of that section and he declared that this measure would restore tranquillity to the country a result demanded by every consideration of discretion
of moderation
of wisdom
and of virtue
when the measure came before president monroe for his approval
he put to each member of his cabinet this question
has congress the constitutional power to prohibit slavery in a territory
and john c
calhoun and william h
crawford from the south
equally with john quincy adams
benjamin rush
and smith thompson from the north
alike answered
without qualification or equivocation and this measure
of so great consequence to the south
was passed and missouri was
by means of it
finally enabled to knock at the door of the republic for an open passage to its brood of slaves
in spite of this
freedom's share is about to be taken by violence by the force of misrepresentative votes
not called for by the popular will
what name can i
in common decency
give to this wicked transaction
but even then the contest was not over for when the missouri constitution came before congress for its approval
it forbade any free negro or mulatto from entering the state
in short
our illinois black laws were hidden away in their constitution laughter
and the controversy was thus revived
then it was that mr
clay's talents shone out conspicuously
and the controversy that shook the union to its foundation was finally settled to the satisfaction of the conservative parties on both sides of the line
though not to the extremists on either
and missouri was admitted by the small majority of six in the lower house
how great a majority
do you think
would have been given had kansas also been secured for slavery
a voice
a majority the other way
a majority the other way
is answered
do you think it would have been safe for a northern man to have confronted his constituents after having voted to consign both missouri and kansas to hopeless slavery
and yet this man douglas
who misrepresents his constituents and who has exerted his highest talents in that direction
will be carried in triumph through the state and hailed with honor while applauding that act
three groans for dug
and this shows whither we are tending
this thing of slavery is more powerful than its supporters even than the high priests that minister at its altar
it debauches even our greatest men
it gathers strength
like a rolling snowball
by its own infamy
monstrous crimes are committed in its name by persons collectively which they would not dare to commit as individuals
its aggressions and encroachments almost surpass belief
in a despotism
one might not wonder to see slavery advance steadily and remorselessly into new dominions but is it not wonderful
is it not even alarming
to see its steady advance in a land dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal
it yields nothing itself it keeps all it has
and gets all it can besides
it really came dangerously near securing illinois in 1824 it did get missouri in 1821
the first proposition was to admit what is now arkansas and missouri as one slave state
but the territory was divided and arkansas came in
without serious question
as a slave state and afterwards missouri
as a sort of equality
but also as a slave state
then we had florida and texas and now kansas is about to be forced into the dismal procession
and so it is wherever you look
we have not forgotten it is but six years since how dangerously near california came to being a slave state
texas is a slave state
and four other slave states may be carved from its vast domain
and yet
in the year 1829
slavery was abolished throughout that vast region by a royal decree of the then sovereign of mexico
will you please tell me by what right slavery exists in texas to day
by the same right as
and no higher or greater than
slavery is seeking dominion in kansas
by political force peaceful
if that will suffice by the torch as in kansas and the bludgeon as in the senate chamber
if required
and so history repeats itself and even as slavery has kept its course by craft
and violence in the past
so it will persist
in my judgment
until met and dominated by the will of a people bent on its restriction
we have
this very afternoon
heard bitter denunciations of brooks in washington
and titus
and shannon in kansas the battle ground of slavery
i certainly am not going to advocate or shield them but they and their acts are but the necessary outcome of the nebraska law
we should reserve our highest censure for the authors of the mischief
and not for the catspaws which they use
i believe it was shakespeare who said
where the offence lies
there let the axe fall and
in my opinion
this man douglas and the northern men in congress who advocate nebraska are more guilty than a thousand joneses and stringfellows
with all their murderous practices
can be
we have made a good beginning here to day
as our methodist friends would say
i feel it is good to be here
while extremists may find some fault with the moderation of our platform
they should recollect that the battle is not always to the strong
nor the race to the swift
in grave emergencies
moderation is generally safer than radicalism and as this struggle is likely to be long and earnest
we must not
by our action
repel any who are in sympathy with us in the main
but rather win all that we can to our standard
we must not belittle nor overlook the facts of our condition that we are new and comparatively weak
while our enemies are entrenched and relatively strong
they have the administration and the political power and
right or wrong
at present they have the numbers
our friends who urge an appeal to arms with so much force and eloquence should recollect that the government is arrayed against us
and that the numbers are now arrayed against us as well or
to state it nearer to the truth
they are not yet expressly and affirmatively for us and we should repel friends rather than gain them by anything savoring of revolutionary methods
as it now stands
we must appeal to the sober sense and patriotism of the people
we will make converts day by day we will grow strong by calmness and moderation we will grow strong by the violence and injustice of our adversaries
unless truth be a mockery and justice a hollow lie
we will be in the majority after a while
and then the revolution which we will accomplish will be none the less radical from being the result of pacific measures
the battle of freedom is to be fought out on principle
slavery is a violation of the eternal right
we have temporized with it from the necessities of our condition but as sure as god reigns and school children read
that black foul lie can never be consecrated into god's hallowed truth
immense applause lasting some time
one of our greatest difficulties is
that men who know that slavery is a detestable crime and ruinous to the nation are compelled
by our peculiar condition and other circumstances
to advocate it concretely
though damning it in the raw
henry clay was a brilliant example of this tendency others of our purest statesmen are compelled to do so and thus slavery secures actual support from those who detest it at heart
yet henry clay perfected and forced through the compromise which secured to slavery a great state as well as a political advantage
not that he hated slavery less
but that he loved the whole union more
as long as slavery profited by his great compromise
the hosts of proslavery could not sufficiently cover him with praise but now that this compromise stands in their way
they never mention him
his name is never heard
their lips are now forbid to speak that once familiar word
they have slaughtered one of his most cherished measures
and his ghost would arise to rebuke them
great applause
now
let us harmonize
my friends
and appeal to the moderation and patriotism of the people
to the sober second thought to the awakened public conscience
the repeal of the sacred missouri compromise has installed the weapons of violence
the bludgeon
the incendiary torch
the death dealing rifle
the bristling cannon the weapons of kingcraft
of the inquisition
of ignorance
of barbarism
of oppression
we see its fruits in the dying bed of the heroic sumner in the ruins of the free state hotel in the smoking embers of the herald of freedom in the free state governor of kansas chained to a stake on freedom's soil like a horse thief
for the crime of freedom
we see it in christian statesmen
and christian newspapers
and christian pulpits applauding the cowardly act of a low bully
who crawled upon his victim behind his back and dealt the deadly blow
sensation and applause
we note our political demoralization in the catch words that are coming into such common use on the one hand
and sometimes freedom screechers laughter
on the other hand
and that fully deserved
and the significance of catch words cannot pass unheeded
for they constitute a sign of the times
everything in this world jibes in with everything else
and all the fruits of this nebraska bill are like the poisoned source from which they come
i will not say that we may not sooner or later be compelled to meet force by force but the time has not yet come
if we are true to ourselves
may never come
do not mistake that the ballot is stronger than the bullet
therefore let the legions of slavery use bullets but let us wait patiently till november and fire ballots at them in return and by that peaceful policy i believe we shall ultimately win
it was by that policy that here in illinois the early fathers fought the good fight and gained the victory
in 1824 the free men of our state
led by governor coles who was a native of maryland and president madison's private secretary
determined that those beautiful groves should never re echo the dirge of one who has no title to himself
by their resolute determination
the winds that sweep across our broad prairies shall never cool the parched brow
nor shall the unfettered streams that bring joy and gladness to our free soil water the tired feet
of a slave but so long as those heavenly breezes and sparkling streams bless the land
or the groves and their fragrance or memory remain
the humanity to which they minister shall be forever free
great applause palmer
and some more in this convention came from kentucky to illinois instead of going to missouri
not only to better their conditions
but also to get away from slavery
they have said so to me
and it is understood among us kentuckians that we don't like it one bit
can we
mindful of the blessings of liberty which the early men of illinois left to us
refuse a like privilege to the free men who seek to plant freedom's banner on our western outposts
no
should we not stand by our neighbors who seek to better their conditions in kansas and nebraska
yes
can we as christian men
and strong and free ourselves
wield the sledge or hold the iron which is to manacle anew an already oppressed race
no
woe unto them
it is written
that decree unrighteous decrees and that write grievousness which they have prescribed
can we afford to sin any more deeply against human liberty
no
one great trouble in the matter is
that slavery is an insidious and crafty power
and gains equally by open violence of the brutal as well as by sly management of the peaceful
even after the ordinance of 1787
the settlers in indiana and illinois it was all one government then tried to get congress to allow slavery temporarily
and petitions to that end were sent from kaskaskia
and general harrison
the governor
urged it from vincennes
the capital
if that had succeeded
good bye to liberty here
but john randolph of virginia made a vigorous report against it and although they persevered so well as to get three favorable reports for it
yet the united states senate
with the aid of some slave states
finally squelched if for good
and that is why this hall is to day a temple for free men instead of a negro livery stable
great applause and laughter
once let slavery get planted in a locality
by ever so weak or doubtful a title
and in ever so small numbers
and it is like the canada thistle or bermuda grass you can't root it out
you yourself may detest slavery but your neighbor has five or six slaves
and he is an excellent neighbor
or your son has married his daughter
and they beg you to help save their property
and you vote against your interests and principle to accommodate a neighbor
hoping that your vote will be on the losing side
and others do the same and in those ways slavery gets a sure foothold
and when that is done the whole mighty union the force of the nation is committed to its support
and that very process is working in kansas to day
and you must recollect that the slave property is worth a billion of dollars while free state men must work for sentiment alone
then there are blue lodges as they call them everywhere doing their secret and deadly work
it is a very strange thing
and not solvable by any moral law that i know of
that if a man loses his horse
the whole country will turn out to help hang the thief but if a man but a shade or two darker than i am is himself stolen
the same crowd will hang one who aids in restoring him to liberty
such are the inconsistencies of slavery
where a horse is more sacred than a man and the essence of squatter or popular sovereignty i don't care how you call it is that if one man chooses to make a slave of another
no third man shall be allowed to object
and if you can do this in free kansas
and it is allowed to stand
the next thing you will see is shiploads of negroes from africa at the wharf at charleston
for one thing is as truly lawful as the other and these are the bastard notions we have got to stamp out
else they will stamp us out
sensation and applause
two years ago
at springfield
judge douglas avowed that illinois came into the union as a slave state
and that slavery was weeded out by the operation of his great
everlasting principle of popular sovereignty
laughter
well
that argument must be answered
for it has a little grain of truth at the bottom
i do not mean that it is true in essence
as he would have us believe
it could not be essentially true if the ordinance of '87 was valid
in point of fact
there were some degraded beings called slaves in kaskaskia and the other french settlements when our first state constitution was adopted that is a fact
and i don't deny it
slaves were brought here as early as 1720
and were kept here in spite of the ordinance of 1787 against it
but slavery did not thrive here
on the contrary
under the influence of the ordinance the number decreased fifty one from 1810 to 1820 while under the influence of squatter sovereignty
right across the river in missouri
they increased seven thousand two hundred and eleven in the same time and slavery finally faded out in illinois
under the influence of the law of freedom
while it grew stronger and stronger in missouri
under the law or practice of popular sovereignty
in point of fact there were but one hundred and seventeen slaves in illinois one year after its admission
or one to every four hundred and seventy of its population or
to state it in another way
if illinois was a slave state in 1820
so were new york and new jersey much greater slave states from having had greater numbers
slavery having been established there in very early times
but there is this vital difference between all these states and the judge's kansas experiment
that they sought to disestablish slavery which had been already established
while the judge seeks
so far as he can
to disestablish freedom
which had been established there by the missouri compromise
the union is under going a fearful strain but it is a stout old ship
and has weathered many a hard blow
and the stars in their courses
aye
an invisible power
greater than the puny efforts of men
will fight for us
but we ourselves must not decline the burden of responsibility
nor take counsel of unworthy passions
whatever duty urges us to do or to omit must be done or omitted and the recklessness with which our adversaries break the laws
or counsel their violation
should afford no example for us
let us revere the declaration of independence let us continue to obey the constitution and the laws let us keep step to the music of the union
let us draw a cordon
so to speak
around the slave states
and the hateful institution
like a reptile poisoning itself
will perish by its own infamy
but we cannot be free men if this is
by our national choice
to be a land of slavery
those who deny freedom to others deserve it not for themselves and
under the rule of a just god
cannot long retain it
loud applause
did you ever
my friends
seriously reflect upon the speed with which we are tending downwards
within the memory of men now present the leading statesman of virginia could make genuine
red hot abolitionist speeches in old virginia
as i have said
now even in free kansas it is a crime to declare that it is free kansas
the very sentiments that i and others have just uttered would entitle us
and each of us
to the ignominy and seclusion of a dungeon and yet i suppose that
like paul
we were free born
but if this thing is allowed to continue
it will be but one step further to impress the same rule in illinois
the conclusion of all is
that we must restore the missouri compromise
we must highly resolve that kansas must be free
great applause
we must reinstate the birthday promise of the republic we must reaffirm the declaration of independence we must make good in essence as well as in form madison's avowal that the word slave ought not to appear in the constitution and we must even go further
and decree that only local law
and not that time honored instrument
shall shelter a slaveholder
we must make this a land of liberty in fact
as it is in name
but in seeking to attain these results so indispensable if the liberty which is our pride and boast shall endure we will be loyal to the constitution and to the flag of our union
and no matter what our grievance even though kansas shall come in as a slave state and no matter what theirs even if we shall restore the compromise we will say to the southern disunionists
we won't go out of the union
and you shan't
this was the climax the audience rose to its feet en masse
waved handkerchiefs
threw hats in the air
and ran riot for several minutes
the arch enchanter who wrought this transformation looked
like the personification of political justice
but let us
appeal to the sense and patriotism of the people
and not to their prejudices let us spread the floods of enthusiasm here aroused all over these vast prairies
so suggestive of freedom
let us commence by electing the gallant soldier governor colonel bissell who stood for the honor of our state alike on the plains and amidst the chaparral of mexico and on the floor of congress
while he defied the southern hotspur and that will have a greater moral effect than all the border ruffians can accomplish in all their raids on kansas
there is both a power and a magic in popular opinion
to that let us now appeal and while
in all probability
no resort to force will be needed
our moderation and forbearance will stand us in good stead when
if ever
we must make an appeal to battle and to the god of hosts
immense applause and a rush for the orator
one can realize with this ability to move people's minds that the southern conspiracy were right to hate this man
better than any at the time was able to uncover their stratagems and tear down their sophisms and contradictions
political correspondence to w

dear whitney
i now expect to go to chicago on the 15th
and i probably shall remain there or thereabouts for about two weeks
it turned me blind when i first heard swett was beaten and lovejoy nominated but
after much reflection
i really believe it is best to let it stand
of course
i wish to be confidential
lamon did get your deeds
i went with him to the office
got them
and put them in his hands myself
yours very truly
on out of state campaigners to william grimes
july 12
1856 your's of the 29th of june was duly received
i did not answer it because it plagued me
this morning i received another from judd and peck
written by consultation with you
now let me tell you why i am plagued
i can hardly spare the time
i am superstitious
i have scarcely known a party preceding an election to call in help from the neighboring states but they lost the state
last fall
our friends had wade
of ohio
and others
in maine and they lost the state
last spring our adversaries had new hampshire full of south carolinians
and they lost the state
and so
it seems to stir up more enemies than friends
have the enemy called in any foreign help
if they have a foreign champion there i should have no objection to drive a nail in his track
i shall reach chicago on the night of the 15th
to attend to a little business in court
consider the things i have suggested
and write me at chicago
especially write me whether browning consents to visit you
your obedient servant
republican campaign speech fragment of speech at galena
in the fremont campaign
august 1
you further charge us with being disunionists
if you mean that it is our aim to dissolve the union
i for myself answer that it is untrue for those who act with me i answer that it is untrue
have you heard us assert that as our aim
do you really believe that such is our aim
do you find it in our platform
our speeches
our conventions
or anywhere
if not
withdraw the charge
but you may say that
though it is not our aim
it will be the result if we succeed
and that we are therefore disunionists in fact
this is a grave charge you make against us
and we certainly have a right to demand that you specify in what way we are to dissolve the union
how are we to effect this
the only specification offered is volunteered by mr
fillmore in his albany speech
his charge is that if we elect a president and vice president both from the free states
it will dissolve the union
this is open folly
the constitution provides that the president and vice president of the united states shall be of different states
but says nothing as to the latitude and longitude of those states
in 1828 andrew jackson
of tennessee
and john c
of south carolina
were elected president and vice president
both from slave states but no one thought of dissolving the union then on that account
in 1840 harrison
of ohio
and tyler
of virginia
were elected
in 1841 harrison died and john tyler succeeded to the presidency
and william r
of alabama
was elected acting vice president by the senate but no one supposed that the union was in danger
in fact
at the very time mr
fillmore uttered this idle charge
the state of things in the united states disproved it
of new hampshire
and mr
of indiana
both from free states
are president and vice president
and the union stands and will stand
you do not pretend that it ought to dissolve the union
and the facts show that it won't therefore the charge may be dismissed without further consideration
no other specification is made
and the only one that could be made is that the restoration of the restriction of 1820
making the united states territory free territory
would dissolve the union
it will require a decided majority to pass such an act
the majority
being able constitutionally to do all that we purpose
would have no desire to dissolve the union
do you say that such restriction of slavery would be unconstitutional
and that some of the states would not submit to its enforcement
i grant you that an unconstitutional act is not a law but i do not ask and will not take your construction of the constitution
the supreme court of the united states is the tribunal to decide such a question
and we will submit to its decisions and if you do also
there will be an end of the matter
will you
if not
who are the disunionists you or we
the majority
would not strive to dissolve the union and if any attempt is made
it must be by you
who so loudly stigmatize us as disunionists
but the union
in any event
will not be dissolved
we don't want to dissolve it
and if you attempt it we won't let you
with the purse and sword
the army and navy and treasury
in our hands and at our command
you could not do it
this government would be very weak indeed if a majority with a disciplined army and navy and a well filled treasury could not preserve itself when attacked by an unarmed
unorganized minority
all this talk about the dissolution of the union is humbug
nothing but folly
we do not want to dissolve the union you shall not
on the danger of third parties to john bennett
1856 dear sir
i understand you are a fillmore man
as between fremont and buchanan
you really prefer the election of buchanan
then burn this without reading a line further
but if you would like to defeat buchanan and his gang
allow me a word with you
does any one pretend that fillmore can carry the vote of this state
i have not heard a single man pretend so
every vote taken from fremont and given to fillmore is just so much in favor of buchanan
the buchanan men see this and hence their great anxiety in favor of the fillmore movement
they know where the shoe pinches
they now greatly prefer having a man of your character go for fillmore than for buchanan because they expect several to go with you
who would go for fremont if you were to go directly for buchanan
i think i now understand the relative strength of the three parties in this state as well as any one man does
and my opinion is that to day buchanan has alone 85
fremont 78
and fillmore 21
this gives b
the state by 7000 and leaves him in the minority of the whole 14
fremont and fillmore men being united on bissell
as they already are
he cannot be beaten
this is not a long letter
but it contains the whole story
yours as ever
to jesse k
dear dubois
your letter on the same sheet with mr
miller's is just received
i have been absent four days
i do not know when your court sits
trumbull has written the committee here to have a set of appointments made for him commencing here in springfield
on the 11th of sept
and to extend throughout the south half of the state
when he goes to lawrenceville
as he will
i will strain every nerve to be with you and him
more than that i cannot promise now
yours as truly as ever
to harrison maltby
confidential springfield
september 8
dear sir
i understand you are a fillmore man
let me prove to you that every vote withheld from fremont and given to fillmore in this state actually lessens fillmore's chance of being president
suppose buchanan gets all the slave states and pennsylvania
and any other one state besides then he is elected
no matter who gets all the rest
but suppose fillmore gets the two slave states of maryland and kentucky then buchanan is not elected fillmore goes into the house of representatives
and may be made president by a compromise
but suppose
fillmore's friends throw away a few thousand votes on him in indiana and illinois it will inevitably give these states to buchanan
which will more than compensate him for the loss of maryland and kentucky
will elect him
and leave fillmore no chance in the house of representatives or out of it
this is as plain as adding up the weight of three small hogs
as mr
fillmore has no possible chance to carry illinois for himself
it is plainly to his interest to let fremont take it
and thus keep it out of the hands of buchanan
be not deceived
buchanan is the hard horse to beat in this race
let him have illinois
and nothing can beat him and he will get illinois if men persist in throwing away votes upon mr
does some one persuade you that mr
fillmore can carry illinois
there are over seventy newspapers in illinois opposing buchanan
only three or four of which support mr
all the rest going for fremont
are not these newspapers a fair index of the proportion of the votes
if not
tell me why
of these three or four fillmore newspapers
at least
are supported in part by the buchanan men
as i understand
do not they know where the shoe pinches
they know the fillmore movement helps them
and therefore they help it
do think these things over
and then act according to your judgment
yours very truly
to dr
my dear sir
yours of the 8th inviting me to be with you at lacon on the 30th is received
i feel that i owe you and our friends of marshall a good deal

after the democratic victory of buchanan fragment of speech at a republican banquet in chicago
december 10
we have another annual presidential message
like a rejected lover making merry at the wedding of his rival
the president felicitates himself hugely over the late presidential election
he considers the result a signal triumph of good principles and good men
and a very pointed rebuke of bad ones
he says the people did it
he forgets that the people
as he complacently calls only those who voted for buchanan
are in a minority of the whole people by about four hundred thousand votes one full tenth of all the votes
remembering this
he might perceive that the rebuke may not be quite as durable as he seems to think that the majority may not choose to remain permanently rebuked by that minority
the president thinks the great body of us fremonters
being ardently attached to liberty
in the abstract
were duped by a few wicked and designing men
there is a slight difference of opinion on this
we think he
being ardently attached to the hope of a second term
in the concrete
was duped by men who had liberty every way
he is the cat's paw
by much dragging of chestnuts from the fire for others to eat
his claws are burnt off to the gristle
and he is thrown aside as unfit for further use
as the fool said of king lear
when his daughters had turned him out of doors
he 's a shelled peascod that 's a sheal'd peascod
so far as the president charges us with a desire to change the domestic institutions of existing states
and of doing everything in our power to deprive the constitution and the laws of moral authority
for the whole party on belief
and for myself on knowledge
i pronounce the charge an unmixed and unmitigated falsehood
our government rests in public opinion
whoever can change public opinion can change the government practically just so much
public opinion
on any subject
always has a central idea
from which all its minor thoughts radiate
that central idea in our political public opinion at the beginning was
and until recently has continued to be
the equality of men
and although it has always submitted patiently to whatever of inequality there seemed to be as matter of actual necessity
its constant working has been a steady progress toward the practical equality of all men
the late presidential election was a struggle by one party to discard that central idea and to substitute for it the opposite idea that slavery is right in the abstract
the workings of which as a central idea may be the perpetuity of human slavery and its extension to all countries and colors
less than a year ago the richmond enquirer
an avowed advocate of slavery
regardless of color
in order to favor his views
invented the phrase state equality
and now the president
in his message
adopts the enquirer's catch phrase
telling us the people have asserted the constitutional equality of each and all of the states of the union as states
the president flatters himself that the new central idea is completely inaugurated and so indeed it is
so far as the mere fact of a presidential election can inaugurate it
to us it is left to know that the majority of the people have not yet declared for it
and to hope that they never will
all of us who did not vote for mr
taken together
are a majority of four hundred thousand
but in the late contest we were divided between fremont and fillmore
can we not come together for the future
let every one who really believes and is resolved that free society is not and shall not be a failure
and who can conscientiously declare that in the last contest he has done only what he thought best let every such one have charity to believe that every other one can say as much
thus let bygones be bygones let past differences as nothing be and with steady eye on the real issue let us reinaugurate the good old central idea of the republic
we can do it
the human heart is with us god is with us
we shall again be able
not to declare that all states as states are equal
nor yet that all citizens as citizens are equal
but to renew the broader
better declaration
including both these and much more
that all men are created equal
to dr
dear sir
when i was at chicago two weeks ago i saw mr
and from a remark of his i inferred he was thinking of the speakership
though i think he was not anxious about it
he seemed most anxious for harmony generally
and particularly that the contested seats from peoria and mcdonough might be rightly determined
since i came home i had a talk with cullom
one of our american representatives here
and he says he is for you for speaker and also that he thinks all the americans will be for you
unless it be gorin
of macon
of whom he cannot speak
if you would like to be speaker go right up and see arnold
he is talented
a practised debater
i think
would do himself more credit on the floor than in the speaker's seat
go and see him and if you think fit
show him this letter
your friend as ever
1857 to john e
february 10
dear sir
your note about the little paragraph in the republican was received yesterday
since which time i have been too unwell to notice it
i had not supposed you wrote or approved it
the whole originated in mistake
you know by the conversation with me that i thought the establishment of the paper unfortunate
but i always expected to throw no obstacle in its way
and to patronize it to the extent of taking and paying for one copy
when the paper was brought to my house
my wife said to me
now are you going to take another worthless little paper
i said to her evasively
i have not directed the paper to be left
from this
in my absence
she sent the message to the carrier
this is the whole story
yours truly
response to a douglas speech speech in springfield
june 26
i am here to night partly by the invitation of some of you
and partly by my own inclination
two weeks ago judge douglas spoke here on the several subjects of kansas
the dred scott decision
and utah
i listened to the speech at the time
and have the report of it since
it was intended to controvert opinions which i think just
and to assail politically
not personally those men who
in common with me
entertain those opinions
for this reason i wished then
and still wish
to make some answer to it
which i now take the opportunity of doing
i begin with utah
if it prove to be true
as is probable
that the people of utah are in open rebellion to the united states
then judge douglas is in favor of repealing their territorial organization
and attaching them to the adjoining states for judicial purposes
i say
if they are in rebellion
they ought to be somehow coerced to obedience and i am not now prepared to admit or deny that the judge's mode of coercing them is not as good as any
the republicans can fall in with it without taking back anything they have ever said
to be sure
it would be a considerable backing down by judge douglas from his much vaunted doctrine of self government for the territories but this is only additional proof of what was very plain from the beginning
that that doctrine was a mere deceitful pretense for the benefit of slavery
those who could not see that much in the nebraska act itself
which forced governors
and secretaries
and judges on the people of the territories without their choice or consent
could not be made to see
though one should rise from the dead
but in all this it is very plain the judge evades the only question the republicans have ever pressed upon the democracy in regard to utah
that question the judge well knew to be this
if the people of utah peacefully form a state constitution tolerating polygamy
will the democracy admit them into the union
there is nothing in the united states constitution or law against polygamy and why is it not a part of the judge's sacred right of self government for the people to have it
or rather to keep it
if they choose
these questions
so far as i know
the judge never answers
it might involve the democracy to answer them either way
and they go unanswered
as to kansas
the substance of the judge's speech on kansas is an effort to put the free state men in the wrong for not voting at the election of delegates to the constitutional convention
he says
there is every reason to hope and believe that the law will be fairly interpreted and impartially executed
so as to insure to every bona fide inhabitant the free and quiet exercise of the elective franchise
it appears extraordinary that judge douglas should make such a statement
he knows that
by the law
no one can vote who has not been registered and he knows that the free state men place their refusal to vote on the ground that but few of them have been registered
it is possible that this is not true
but judge douglas knows it is asserted to be true in letters
and public speeches
and borne by every mail and blown by every breeze to the eyes and ears of the world
he knows it is boldly declared that the people of many whole counties
and many whole neighborhoods in others
are left unregistered yet he does not venture to contradict the declaration
or to point out how they can vote without being registered but he just slips along
not seeming to know there is any such question of fact
and complacently declares
there is every reason to hope and believe that the law will be fairly and impartially executed
so as to insure to every bona fide inhabitant the free and quiet exercise of the elective franchise
i readily agree that if all had a chance to vote they ought to have voted
on the contrary
as they allege
and judge douglas ventures not to particularly contradict
few only of the free state men had a chance to vote
they were perfectly right in staying from the polls in a body
by the way
since the judge spoke
the kansas election has come off
the judge expressed his confidence that all the democrats in kansas would do their duty including free state democrats
of course
the returns received here as yet are very incomplete but so far as they go
they indicate that only about one sixth of the registered voters have really voted and this
when not more
than one half of the rightful voters have been registered
thus showing the thing to have been altogether the most exquisite farce ever enacted
i am watching with considerable interest to ascertain what figure the free state democrats cut in the concern
of course they voted
all democrats do their duty
and of course they did not vote for slave state candidates
we soon shall know how many delegates they elected
how many candidates they had pledged to a free state
and how many votes were cast for them
allow me to barely whisper my suspicion that there were no such things in kansas as free state democrats that they were altogether mythical
good only to figure in newspapers and speeches in the free states
if there should prove to be one real living free state democrat in kansas
i suggest that it might be well to catch him
and stuff and preserve his skin as an interesting specimen of that soon to be extinct variety of the genus democrat
and now as to the dred scott decision
that decision declares two propositions first
that a negro cannot sue in the united states courts and secondly
that congress cannot prohibit slavery in the territories
it was made by a divided court dividing differently on the different points
judge douglas does not discuss the merits of the decision
and in that respect i shall follow his example
believing i could no more improve on mclean and curtis than he could on taney
he denounces all who question the correctness of that decision
as offering violent resistance to it
but who resists it
who has
in spite of the decision
declared dred scott free
and resisted the authority of his master over him
judicial decisions have two uses first
to absolutely determine the case decided
and secondly
to indicate to the public how other similar cases will be decided when they arise
for the latter use
they are called precedents and authorities
we believe as much as judge douglas perhaps more in obedience to
and respect for
the judicial department of government
we think its decisions on constitutional questions
when fully settled
should control not only the particular cases decided
but the general policy of the country
subject to be disturbed only by amendments of the constitution as provided in that instrument itself
more than this would be revolution
but we think the dred scott decision is erroneous
we know the court that made it has often overruled its own decisions
and we shall do what we can to have it to overrule this
we offer no resistance to it
judicial decisions are of greater or less authority as precedents according to circumstances
that this should be so accords both with common sense and the customary understanding of the legal profession
if this important decision had been made by the unanimous concurrence of the judges
and without any apparent partisan bias
and in accordance with legal public expectation and with the steady practice of the departments throughout our history
and had been in no part based on assumed historical facts which are not really true or
if wanting in some of these
it had been before the court more than once
and had there been affirmed and reaffirmed through a course of years
it then might be
perhaps would be
even revolutionary
not to acquiesce in it as a precedent
but when
as is true
we find it wanting in all these claims to the public confidence
it is not resistance
it is not factious
it is not even disrespectful
to treat it as not having yet quite established a settled doctrine for the country
but judge douglas considers this view awful
hear him
the courts are the tribunals prescribed by the constitution and created by the authority of the people to determine
and enforce the law
whoever resists the final decision of the highest judicial tribunal aims a deadly blow at our whole republican system of government a blow which
if successful
would place all our rights and liberties at the mercy of passion
and violence
i repeat
that if resistance to the decisions of the supreme court of the united states
in a matter like the points decided in the dred scott case
clearly within their jurisdiction as defined by the constitution
shall be forced upon the country as a political issue
it will become a distinct and naked issue between the friends and enemies of the constitution the friends and the enemies of the supremacy of the laws
why
this same supreme court once decided a national bank to be constitutional but general jackson
as president of the united states
disregarded the decision
and vetoed a bill for a recharter
partly on constitutional ground
declaring that each public functionary must support the constitution as he understands it
but hear the general's own words
here they are
taken from his veto message
it is maintained by the advocates of the bank that its constitutionality
in all its features
ought to be considered as settled by precedent
and by the decision of the supreme court
to this conclusion i cannot assent
mere precedent is a dangerous source of authority
and should not be regarded as deciding questions of constitutional power
except where the acquiescence of the people and the states can be considered as well settled
so far from this being the case on this subject
an argument against the bank might be based on precedent
one congress
in 1791
decided in favor of a bank another
in 1811
decided against it
one congress
in 1815
decided against a bank another
in 1816
decided in its favor
prior to the present congress
the precedents drawn from that course were equal
if we resort to the states
the expressions of legislative
and executive opinions against the bank have been probably to those in its favor as four to one
there is nothing in precedent
if its authority were admitted
ought to weigh in favor of the act before me
i drop the quotations merely to remark that all there ever was in the way of precedent up to the dred scott decision
on the points therein decided
had been against that decision
but hear general jackson further
if the opinion of the supreme court covered the whole ground of this act
it ought not to control the coordinate authorities of this government
the congress
the executive
and the courts must
each for itself
be guided by its own opinion of the constitution
each public officer who takes an oath to support the constitution swears that he will support it as he understands it
and not as it is understood by others
again and again have i heard judge douglas denounce that bank decision and applaud general jackson for disregarding it
it would be interesting for him to look over his recent speech
and see how exactly his fierce philippics against us for resisting supreme court decisions fall upon his own head
it will call to mind a long and fierce political war in this country
upon an issue which
in his own language
of course
in his own changeless estimation
was a distinct issue between the friends and the enemies of the constitution
and in which war he fought in the ranks of the enemies of the constitution
i have said
in substance
that the dred scott decision was in part based on assumed historical facts which were not really true
and i ought not to leave the subject without giving some reasons for saying this i therefore give an instance or two
which i think fully sustain me
chief justice taney
in delivering the opinion of the majority of the court
insists at great length that negroes were no part of the people who made
or for whom was made
the declaration of independence
or the constitution of the united states
on the contrary
judge curtis
in his dissenting opinion
shows that in five of the then thirteen states to wit
new hampshire
new york
new jersey
and north carolina free negroes were voters
and in proportion to their numbers had the same part in making the constitution that the white people had
he shows this with so much particularity as to leave no doubt of its truth and as a sort of conclusion on that point
holds the following language
the constitution was ordained and established by the people of the united states
through the action
in each state
of those persons who were qualified by its laws to act thereon in behalf of themselves and all other citizens of the state
in some of the states
as we have seen
colored persons were among those qualified by law to act on the subject
these colored persons were not only included in the body of 'the people of the united states' by whom the constitution was ordained and established but in at least five of the states they had the power to act
and doubtless did act
by their suffrages
upon the question of its adoption
again
chief justice taney says
it is difficult at this day to realize the state of public opinion
in relation to that unfortunate race
which prevailed in the civilized and enlightened portions of the world at the time of the declaration of independence
and when the constitution of the united states was framed and adopted
and again
after quoting from the declaration
he says
the general words above quoted would seem to include the whole human family
and if they were used in a similar instrument at this day
would be so understood
in these the chief justice does not directly assert
but plainly assumes as a fact
that the public estimate of the black man is more favorable now than it was in the days of the revolution
this assumption is a mistake
in some trifling particulars the condition of that race has been ameliorated but as a whole
in this country
the change between then and now is decidedly the other way
and their ultimate destiny has never appeared so hopeless as in the last three or four years
in two of the five states new jersey and north carolina that then gave the free negro the right of voting
the right has since been taken away
and in a third new york it has been greatly abridged while it has not been extended
so far as i know
to a single additional state
though the number of the states has more than doubled
in those days
as i understand
masters could
at their own pleasure
emancipate their slaves but since then such legal restraints have been made upon emancipation as to amount almost to prohibition
in those days legislatures held the unquestioned power to abolish slavery in their respective states
but now it is becoming quite fashionable for state constitutions to withhold that power from the legislatures
in those days
by common consent
the spread of the black man's bondage to the new countries was prohibited
but now congress decides that it will not continue the prohibition
and the supreme court decides that it could not if it would
in those days our declaration of independence was held sacred by all
and thought to include all but now
to aid in making the bondage of the negro universal and eternal
it is assailed and sneered at and construed and hawked at and torn
if its framers could rise from their graves
they could not at all recognize it
all the powers of earth seem rapidly combining against him
mammon is after him
ambition follows
philosophy follows
and the theology of the day fast joining the cry
they have him in his prison house they have searched his person
and left no prying instrument with him
one after another they have closed the heavy iron doors upon him and now they have him
as it were
bolted in with a lock of hundred keys
which can never be unlocked without the concurrence of every key the keys in the hands of a hundred different men
and they scattered to hundred different and distant places and they stand musing as to what invention
in all the dominions of mind and matter
can be produced to make the impossibility of his escape more complete than it is
it is grossly incorrect to say or assume that the public estimate of the negro is more favorable now than it was at the origin of the government
three years and a half ago
judge douglas brought forward his famous nebraska bill
the country was at once in a blaze
he scorned all opposition
and carried it through congress
since then he has seen himself superseded in a presidential nomination by one indorsing the general doctrine of his measure
but at the same time standing clear of the odium of its untimely agitation and its gross breach of national faith and he has seen that successful rival constitutionally elected
not by the strength of friends
but by the division of adversaries
being in a popular minority of nearly four hundred thousand votes
he has seen his chief aids in his own state
shields and richardson
politically speaking
successively tried
and executed for an offence not their own but his
and now he sees his own case standing next on the docket for trial
there is a natural disgust in the minds of nearly all white people at the idea of an indiscriminate amalgamation of the white and black races and judge douglas evidently is basing his chief hope upon the chances of his being able to appropriate the benefit of this disgust to himself
if he can
by much drumming and repeating
fasten the odium of that idea upon his adversaries
he thinks he can struggle through the storm
he therefore clings to this hope
as a drowning man to the last plank
he makes an occasion for lugging it in from the opposition to the dred scott decision
he finds the republicans insisting that the declaration of independence includes all men
black as well as white
and forthwith he boldly denies that it includes negroes at all
and proceeds to argue gravely that all who contend it does
do so only because they want to vote
and eat
and sleep
and marry with negroes
he will have it that they cannot be consistent else
now i protest against the counterfeit logic which concludes that
because i do not want a black woman for a slave i must necessarily want her for a wife
i need not have her for either
i can just leave her alone
in some respects she certainly is not my equal but in her natural right to eat the bread she earns with her own hands
without asking leave of any one else
she is my equal and the equal of all others
chief justice taney
in his opinion in the dred scott case
admits that the language of the declaration is broad enough to include the whole human family
but he and judge douglas argue that the authors of that instrument did not intend to include negroes
by the fact that they did not at once actually place them on an equality with the whites
now this grave argument comes to just nothing at all
by the other fact that they did not at once
or ever afterward
actually place all white people on an equality with one another
and this is the staple argument of both the chief justice and the senator for doing this obvious violence to the plain
unmistakable language of the declaration
i think the authors of that notable instrument intended to include all men
but they did not intend to declare all men equal in all respects
they did not mean to say all were equal in color
moral developments
or social capacity
they defined with tolerable distinctness in what respects they did consider all men created equal equal with certain inalienable rights
among which are life
and the pursuit of happiness
this they said
and this they meant
they did not mean to assert the obvious untruth that all were then actually enjoying that equality
nor yet that they were about to confer it immediately upon them
in fact
they had no power to confer such a boon
they meant simply to declare the right
so that enforcement of it might follow as fast as circumstances should permit
they meant to set up a standard maxim for free society
which should be familiar to all
and revered by all constantly looked to
constantly labored for
even though never perfectly attained
constantly approximated
and thereby constantly spreading and deepening its influence and augmenting the happiness and value of life to all people of all colors everywhere
the assertion that all men are created equal was of no practical use in effecting our separation from great britain and it was placed in the declaration not for that
but for future use
its authors meant it to be as thank god
it is now proving itself stumbling block to all those who in after times might seek to turn a free people back into the hateful paths of despotism
they knew the proneness of prosperity to breed tyrants
and they meant when such should reappear in this fair land and commence their vocation
they should find left for them at least one hard nut to crack
i have now briefly expressed my view of the meaning and object of that part of the declaration of independence which declares that all men are created equal
now let us hear judge douglas's view of the same subject
as i find it in the printed report of his late speech
here it is
no man can vindicate the character
and conduct of the signers of the declaration of independence
except upon the hypothesis that they referred to the white race alone
and not to the african
when they declared all men to have been created equal that they were speaking of british subjects on this continent being equal to british subjects born and residing in great britain that they were entitled to the same inalienable rights
and among them were enumerated life
and the pursuit of happiness
the declaration was adopted for the purpose of justifying the colonists in the eyes of the civilized world in withdrawing their allegiance from the british crown
and dissolving their connection with the mother country
my good friends
read that carefully over some leisure hour
and ponder well upon it see what a mere wreck mangled ruin it makes of our once glorious declaration
they were speaking of british subjects on this continent being equal to british subjects born and residing in great britain
according to this
not only negroes but white people outside of great britain and america were not spoken of in that instrument
the english
and scotch
along with white americans
were included
to be sure
but the french
and other white people of the world are all gone to pot along with the judge's inferior races
i had thought the declaration promised something better than the condition of british subjects but no
it only meant that we should be equal to them in their own oppressed and unequal condition
according to that
it gave no promise that
having kicked off the king and lords of great britain
we should not at once be saddled with a king and lords of our own
i had thought the declaration contemplated the progressive improvement in the condition of all men everywhere but no
it merely was adopted for the purpose of justifying the colonists in the eyes of the civilized world in withdrawing their allegiance from the british crown
and dissolving their connection with the mother country
why
that object having been effected some eighty years ago
the declaration is of no practical use now mere rubbish old wadding left to rot on the battlefield after the victory is won
i understand you are preparing to celebrate the fourth
to morrow week
what for
the doings of that day had no reference to the present and quite half of you are not even descendants of those who were referred to at that day
but i suppose you will celebrate
and will even go so far as to read the declaration
after you read it once in the old fashioned way
you read it once more with judge douglas's version
it will then run thus
we hold these truths to be self evident
that all british subjects who were on this continent eighty one years ago were created equal to all british subjects born and then residing in great britain
and now i appeal to all to democrats as well as others are you really willing that the declaration shall thus be frittered away
thus left no more
at most
than an interesting memorial of the dead past
thus shorn of its vitality and practical value
and left without the germ or even the suggestion of the individual rights of man in it
but judge douglas is especially horrified at the thought of the mixing of blood by the white and black races
agreed for once a thousand times agreed
there are white men enough to marry all the white women and black men enough to many all the black women and so let them be married
on this point we fully agree with the judge
and when he shall show that his policy is better adapted to prevent amalgamation than ours
we shall drop ours and adopt his
let us see
in 1850 there were in the united states 405
751 mulattoes
very few of these are the offspring of whites and free blacks nearly all have sprung from black slaves and white masters
a separation of the races is the only perfect preventive of amalgamation but as an immediate separation is impossible
the next best thing is to keep them apart where they are not already together
if white and black people never get together in kansas
they will never mix blood in kansas
that is at least one self evident truth
a few free colored persons may get into the free states
in any event but their number is too insignificant to amount to much in the way of mixing blood
in 1850 there were in the free states 56
649 mulattoes but for the most part they were not born there they came from the slave states
ready made up
in the same year the slave states had 348
874 mulattoes
all of home production
the proportion of free mulattoes to free blacks the only colored classes in the free states is much greater in the slave than in the free states
it is worthy of note
that among the free states those which make the colored man the nearest equal to the white have proportionably the fewest mulattoes
the least of amalgamation
in new hampshire
the state which goes farthest toward equality between the races
there are just 184 mulattoes
while there are in virginia how many do you think
being 23
126 more than in all the free states together
these statistics show that slavery is the greatest source of amalgamation
and next to it
not the elevation
but the degradation of the free blacks
yet judge douglas dreads the slightest restraints on the spread of slavery
and the slightest human recognition of the negro
as tending horribly to amalgamation
the very dred scott case affords a strong test as to which party most favors amalgamation
the republicans or the dear union saving democracy
dred scott
his wife
and two daughters were all involved in the suit
we desired the court to have held that they were citizens so far at least as to entitle them to a hearing as to whether they were free or not and then
that they were in fact and in law really free
could we have had our way
the chances of these black girls ever mixing their blood with that of white people would have been diminished at least to the extent that it could not have been without their consent
but judge douglas is delighted to have them decided to be slaves
and not human enough to have a hearing
even if they were free
and thus left subject to the forced concubinage of their masters
and liable to become the mothers of mulattoes in spite of themselves
the very state of case that produces nine tenths of all the mulattoes all the mixing of blood in the nation
of course
i state this case as an illustration only
not meaning to say or intimate that the master of dred scott and his family
or any more than a percentage of masters generally
are inclined to exercise this particular power which they hold over their female slaves
i have said that the separation of the races is the only perfect preventive of amalgamation
i have no right to say all the members of the republican party are in favor of this
nor to say that as a party they are in favor of it
there is nothing in their platform directly on the subject
but i can say a very large proportion of its members are for it
and that the chief plank in their platform opposition to the spread of slavery is most favorable to that separation
such separation
if ever effected at all
must be effected by colonization and no political party
as such
is now doing anything directly for colonization
party operations at present only favor or retard colonization incidentally
the enterprise is a difficult one but where there is a will there is a way
and what colonization needs most is a hearty will
will springs from the two elements of moral sense and self interest
let us be brought to believe it is morally right
and at the same time favorable to
or at least not against
our interest to transfer the african to his native clime
and we shall find a way to do it
however great the task may be
the children of israel
to such numbers as to include four hundred thousand fighting men
went out of egyptian bondage in a body
how differently the respective courses of the democratic and republican parties incidentally
bear on the question of forming a will a public sentiment for colonization
is easy to see
the republicans inculcate
with whatever of ability they can
that the negro is a man
that his bondage is cruelly wrong
and that the field of his oppression ought not to be enlarged
the democrats deny his manhood deny
or dwarf to insignificance
the wrong of his bondage so far as possible crush all sympathy for him
and cultivate and excite hatred and disgust against him compliment themselves as union savers for doing so and call the indefinite outspreading of his bondage a sacred right of self government
the plainest print cannot be read through a gold eagle and it will be ever hard to find many men who will send a slave to liberia
and pay his passage
while they can send him to a new country kansas
for instance and sell him for fifteen hundred dollars
and the rise
to william grimes
1857 dear sir
yours of the 14th is received
and i am much obliged for the legal information you give
you can scarcely be more anxious than i that the next election in iowa should result in favor of the republicans
i lost nearly all the working part of last year
giving my time to the canvass and i am altogether too poor to lose two years together
i am engaged in a suit in the united states court at chicago
in which the rock island bridge company is a party
the trial is to commence on the 8th of september
and probably will last two or three weeks
during the trial it is not improbable that all hands may come over and take a look at the bridge
if it were possible to make it hit right
i could then speak at davenport
my courts go right on without cessation till late in november
write me again
pointing out the more striking points of difference between your old and new constitutions
and also whether democratic and republican party lines were drawn in the adoption of it
and which were for and which were against it
by possibility
i could get over among you it might be of some advantage to know these things in advance
yours very truly
argument in the rock island bridge case
from the daily press of chicago
hurd et al
vs railroad bridge co
united states circuit court
john mclean
presiding judge
13th day
lincoln addressed the jury
he said he did not purpose to assail anybody
that he expected to grow earnest as he proceeded but not ill natured
there is some conflict of testimony in the case
he said
but one quarter of such a number of witnesses seldom agree
and even if all were on one side some discrepancy might be expected
we are to try and reconcile them
and to believe that they are not intentionally erroneous as long as we can
he had no prejudice
he said
against steamboats or steamboat men nor any against st
for he supposed they went about this matter as other people would do in their situation
he continued
as a commercial place may desire that this bridge should not stand
as it is adverse to her commerce
diverting a portion of it from the river and it may be that she supposes that the additional cost of railroad transportation upon the productions of iowa will force them to go to st
louis if this bridge is removed
the meetings in st
louis are connected with this case only as some witnesses are in it
and thus has some prejudice added color to their testimony
the last thing that would be pleasing to him
lincoln said
would be to have one of these great channels
extending almost from where it never freezes to where it never thaws
blocked up
but there is a travel from east to west whose demands are not less important than those of the river
it is growing larger and larger
building up new countries with a rapidity never before seen in the history of the world
he alluded to the astonishing growth of illinois
having grown within his memory to a population of a million and a half to iowa and the other young rising communities of the northwest
this current of travel
said he
has its rights as well as that of north and south
if the river had not the advantage in priority and legislation we could enter into free competition with it and we could surpass it
this particular railroad line has a great importance and the statement of its business during a little less than a year shows this importance
it is in evidence that from september 8
to august 8
586 freight cars and 74
179 passengers passed over this bridge
navigation was closed four days short of four months last year
and during this time while the river was of no use this road and bridge were valuable
there is
a considerable portion of time when floating or thin ice makes the river useless while the bridge is as useful as ever
this shows that this bridge must be treated with respect in this court and is not to be kicked about with contempt
the other day judge wead alluded to the strike of the contending interest and even a dissolution of the union
the proper mode for all parties in this affair is to 'live and let live
 and then we will find a cessation of this trouble about the bridge
what mood were the steamboat men in when this bridge was burned
there was a shouting and ringing of bells and whistling on all the boats as it fell
it was a jubilee
a greater celebration than follows an excited election
the first thing i will proceed to is the record of mr
gurney and the complaint of judge wead that the record did not extend back over all the time from the completion of the bridge
the principal part of the navigation after the bridge was burned passed through the span
when the bridge was repaired and the boats were a second time confined to the draw it was provided that this record should be kept
that is the simple history of that book
from april 19th
to may 6th seventeen days there were twenty accidents and all the time since then there have been but twenty hits
including seven accidents
so that the dangers of this place are tapering off and as the boatmen get cool the accidents get less
we may soon expect if this ratio is kept up that there will be no accidents at all
judge wead said
while admitting that the floats went straight through
there was a difference between a float and a boat
but i do not remember that he indulged us with an argument in support of this statement
is it because there is a difference in size
will not a small body and a large one float the same way under the same influence
true a flatboat will float faster than an egg shell and the egg shell might be blown away by the wind
but if under the same influence they would go the same way
various things the witnesses say all show the same current
then is not this test reliable
at all depths too the direction of the current is the same
a series of these floats would make a line as long as a boat and would show any influence upon any part and all parts of the boat
i will now speak of the angular position of the piers
what is the amount of the angle
the course of the river is a curve and the pier is straight
if a line is produced from the upper end of the long pier straight with the pier to a distance of 350 feet
and a line is drawn from a point in the channel opposite this point to the head of the pier
colonel nason says they will form an angle of twenty degrees
but the angle if measured at the pier is seven degrees that is
we would have to move the pier seven degrees to make it exactly straight with the current
would that make the navigation better or worse
the witnesses of the plaintiff seem to think it was only necessary to say that the pier formed an angle with the current and that settled the matter
our more careful and accurate witnesses say that
though they had been accustomed to seeing the piers placed straight with the current
yet they could see that here the current had been made straight by us in having made this slight angle that the water now runs just right
that it is straight and cannot be improved
they think that if the pier was changed the eddy would be divided and the navigation improved
i am not now going to discuss the question what is a material obstruction
we do not greatly differ about the law
the cases produced here are
i suppose
proper to be taken into consideration by the court in instructing a jury
some of them i think are not exactly in point
but i am still willing to trust his honor
judge mclean
and take his instructions as law
what is reasonable skill and care
this is a thing of which the jury are to judge
i differ from the other side when it says that they are bound to exercise no more care than was taken before the building of the bridge
if we are allowed by the legislature to build the bridge which will require them to do more than before
when a pilot comes along
it is unreasonable for him to dash on heedless of this structure which has been legally put there
the afton came there on the 5th and lay at rock island until next morning
when a boat lies up the pilot has a holiday
and would not any of these jurors have then gone around to the bridge and gotten acquainted with the place
pilot parker has shown here that he does not understand the draw
i heard him say that the fall from the head to the foot of the pier was four feet he needs information
he could have gone there that day and seen there was no such fall
he should have discarded passion and the chances are that he would have had no disaster at all
he was bound to make himself acquainted with the place
mccammon says that the current and the swell coming from the long pier drove her against the long pier
in other words drove her toward the very pier from which the current came
it is an absurdity
an impossibility
the only recollection i can find for this contradiction is in a current which white says strikes out from the long pier and then like a ram's horn turns back
and this might have acted somehow in this manner
it is agreed by all that the plaintiff's boat was destroyed and that it was destroyed upon the head of the short pier that she moved from the channel where she was with her bow above the head of the long pier
till she struck the short one
swung around under the bridge and there was crowded and destroyed
i shall try to prove that the average velocity of the current through the draw with the boat in it should be five and a half miles an hour that it is slowest at the head of the pier and swiftest at the foot of the pier
their lowest estimate in evidence is six miles an hour
their highest twelve miles
this was the testimony of men who had made no experiment
only conjecture
we have adopted the most exact means
the water runs swiftest in high water and we have taken the point of nine feet above low water
the water when the afton was lost was seven feet above low water
or at least a foot lower than our time
brayton and his assistants timed the instruments
the best instruments known in measuring currents
they timed them under various circumstances and they found the current five miles an hour and no more
they found that the water at the upper end ran slower than five miles that below it was swifter than five miles
but that the average was five miles
shall men who have taken no care
who conjecture
some of whom speak of twenty miles an hour
be believed against those who have had such a favorable and well improved opportunity
they should not even qualify the result
several men have given their opinion as to the distance of the steamboat carson
and i suppose if one should go and measure that distance you would believe him in preference to all of them
these measurements were made when the boat was not in the draw
it has been ascertained what is the area of the cross section of this stream and the area of the face of the piers
and the engineers say that the piers being put there will increase the current proportionally as the space is decreased
so with the boat in the draw
the depth of the channel was twenty two feet
the width one hundred and sixteen feet multiply these and you have the square feet across the water of the draw
2552 feet
the afton was 35 feet wide and drew 5 feet
making a fourteenth of the sum
one fourteenth of five miles is five fourteenths of one mile about one third of a mile the increase of the current
we will call the current five and a half miles per hour
the next thing i will try to prove is that the plaintiff's
boat had power to run six miles an hour in that current
it had been testified that she was a strong
swift boat
able to run eight miles an hour up stream in a current of four miles an hour
and fifteen miles down stream
strike the average and you will find what is her average about eleven and a half miles
take the five and a half miles which is the speed of the current in the draw and it leaves the power of that boat in that draw at six miles an hour
528 feet per minute and 8 4 5 feet to the second
next i propose to show that there are no cross currents
i know their witnesses say that there are cross currents that
as one witness says
there were three cross currents and two eddies so far as mere statement
without experiment
and mingled with mistakes
can go
they have proved
but can these men's testimony be compared with the nice
thorough experiments of our witnesses
can you believe that these floats go across the currents
it is inconceivable that they could not have discovered every possible current
how do boats find currents that floats cannot discover
we assume the position then that those cross currents are not there
my next proposition is that the afton passed between the s
carson and the iowa shore
that is undisputed
next i shall show that she struck first the short pier
then the long pier
then the short one again and there she stopped
mr
lincoln then cited the testimony of eighteen witnesses on this point
how did the boat strike when she went in
here is an endless variety of opinion
but ten of them say what pier she struck three of them testify that she struck first the short
then the long and then the short for the last time
none of the rest substantially contradict this
i assume that these men have got the truth because i believe it an established fact
my next proposition is that after she struck the short and long pier and before she got back to the short pier the boat got right with her bow up
so says the pilot parker that he got her through until her starboard wheel passed the short pier
this would make her head about even with the head of the long pier
he says her head was as high or higher than the head of the long pier
other witnesses confirmed this one
the final stroke was in the splash door aft the wheel
witnesses differ
but the majority say that she struck thus
court adjourned
14th day
lincoln resumed
he said he should conclude as soon as possible
he said the colored map of the plaintiff which was brought in during one stage of the trial showed itself that the cross currents alleged did not exist
that the current as represented would drive an ascending boat to the long pier but not to the short pier
as they urge
he explained from a model of a boat where the splash door is
just behind the wheel
the boat struck on the lower shoulder of the short pier as she swung around in the splash door then as she went on around she struck the point or end of the pier
where she rested
her engineers
said mr
say the starboard wheel then was rushing around rapidly
then the boat must have struck the upper point of the pier so far back as not to disturb the wheel
it is forty feet from the stern of the afton to the splash door
and thus it appears that she had but forty feet to go to clear the pier
how was it that the afton with all her power flanked over from the channel to the short pier without moving one foot ahead
suppose she was in the middle of the draw
her wheel would have been 31 feet from the short pier
the reason she went over thus is her starboard wheel was not working
i shall try to establish the fact that the wheel was not running and that after she struck she went ahead strong on this same wheel
upon the last point the witnesses agree
that the starboard wheel was running after she struck
and no witnesses say that it was running while she was out in the draw flanking over
mr
lincoln read from the testimonies of various witnesses to prove that the starboard wheel was not working while the afton was out in the stream
other witnesses show that the captain said something of the machinery of the wheel
and the inference is that he knew the wheel was not working
the fact is undisputed that she did not move one inch ahead while she was moving this 31 feet sideways
there is evidence proving that the current there is only five miles an hour
and the only explanation is that her power was not all used that only one wheel was working
the pilot says he ordered the engineers to back her up
the engineers differ from him and said they kept on going ahead
the bow was so swung that the current pressed it over the pilot pressed the stern over with the rudder
though not so fast but that the bow gained on it
and only one wheel being in motion the boat nearly stood still so far as motion up and down is concerned
and thus she was thrown upon this pier
the afton came into the draw after she had just passed the carson
and as the carson no doubt kept the true course the afton going around her got out of the proper way
got across the current into the eddy which is west of a straight line drawn down from the long pier
was compelled to resort to these changes of wheels
which she did not do with sufficient adroitness to save her
was it not her own fault that she entered wrong
so far wrong that she never got right
is the defence to blame for that
for several days we were entertained with depositions about boats 'smelling a bar
 why did the afton then
after she had come up smelling so close to the long pier sheer off so strangely
when she got to the centre of the very nose she was smelling she seemed suddenly to have lost her sense of smell and to have flanked over to the short pier
mr
lincoln said there was no practicability in the project of building a tunnel under the river
for there is not a tunnel that is a successful project in this world
a suspension bridge cannot be built so high but that the chimneys of the boats will grow up till they cannot pass
the steamboat men will take pains to make them grow
the cars of a railroad cannot without immense expense rise high enough to get even with a suspension bridge or go low enough to get through a tunnel such expense is unreasonable
the plaintiffs have to establish that the bridge is a material obstruction and that they have managed their boat with reasonable care and skill
as to the last point high winds have nothing to do with it
for it was not a windy day
they must show due skill and care
difficulties going down stream will not do
for they were going up stream
difficulties with barges in tow have nothing to do with the accident
for they had no barge
mr
lincoln said he had much more to say
many things he could suggest to the jury
but he wished to close to save time

henry c
my dear sir
coming home from bloomington last night i found your letter of the 15th
i know of no express statute or decisions as to what a j
upon the expiration of his term shall do with his docket books
unfinished business
but so far as i know
the practice has been to hand over to the successor
and to cease to do anything further whatever
in perfect analogy to sections 110 and 112
and i have supposed and do suppose this is the law
i think the successor may forthwith do whatever the retiring j
might have done
as to the proviso to section 114 i think it was put in to cover possible cases
by way of caution
and not to authorize the j
to go forward and finish up whatever might have been begun by him
the view i take
i believe
is the common law principle
as to retiring officers and their successors
to which i remember but one exception
which is the case of sheriff and ministerial officers of that class
i have not had time to examine this subject fully
but i have great confidence i am right
you must not think of offering me pay for this
john o
johnson is my friend i gave your name to him
he is doing the work of trying to get up a republican organization
i do not suppose long john ever saw or heard of him
let me say to you confidentially
that i do not entirely appreciate what the republican papers of chicago are so constantly saying against long john
i consider those papers truly devoted to the republican cause
and not unfriendly to me but i do think that more of what they say against long john is dictated by personal malice than themselves are conscious of
we can not afford to lose the services of long john and i do believe the unrelenting warfare made upon him is injuring our cause
i mean this to be confidential
if you quietly co operate with mr
johnson on getting up an organization
i think it will be right

political communication to w
june 11
1858 dear sir
yours of the 9th written at joliet is just received
two or three days ago i learned that mclean had appointed delegates in favor of lovejoy
and thenceforward i have considered his renomination a fixed fact
my opinion if my opinion is of any consequence in this case
in which it is no business of mine to interfere remains unchanged
that running an independent candidate against lovejoy will not do that it will result in nothing but disaster all round
in the first place
whosoever so runs will be beaten and will be spotted for life in the second place
while the race is in progress
he will be under the strongest temptation to trade with the democrats
and to favor the election of certain of their friends to the legislature thirdly
i shall be held responsible for it
and republican members of the legislature who are partial to lovejoy will for that purpose oppose us and lastly
it will in the end lose us the district altogether
there is no safe way but a convention and if in that convention
upon a common platform which all are willing to stand upon
one who has been known as an abolitionist
but who is now occupying none but common ground
can get the majority of the votes to which all look for an election
there is no safe way but to submit
as to the inclination of some republicans to favor douglas
that is one of the chances i have to run
and which i intend to run with patience
i write in the court room
court has opened
and i must close

brief autobiography
june 15
the compiler of the dictionary of congress states that while preparing that work for publication
in 1858
he sent to mr
lincoln the usual request for a sketch of his life
and received the following reply
born february 12
in hardin county
a lawyer
have been a captain of volunteers in black hawk war
postmaster at a very small office
four times a member of the illinois legislature and was a member of the lower house of congress
the papers and writings of abraham lincoln volume three constitutional edition by abraham lincoln edited by arthur brooks lapsley the lincoln douglas debates i political speeches debates of lincoln with douglas in the senatorial campaign of 1858 in illinois speech at springfield
june 17
1858 the following speech was delivered at springfield
at the close of the republican state convention held at that time and place
and by which convention mr
lincoln had been named as their candidate for united states senator
douglas was not present
mr
president and gentlemen of the convention
if we could first know where we are
and whither we are tending
we could better judge what to do
and how to do it
we are now far into the fifth year since a policy was initiated with the avowed object and confident promise of putting an end to slavery agitation
under the operation of that policy
that agitation has not only not ceased
but has constantly augmented
in my opinion
it will not cease until a crisis shall have been reached and passed
a house divided against itself cannot stand
i believe this government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free
i do not expect the union to be dissolved i do not expect the house to fall but i do expect it will cease to be divided
it will become all one thing
or all the other
either the opponents of slavery will arrest the further spread of it
and place it where the public mind shall rest in the belief that it is in the course of ultimate extinction
or its advocates will push it forward till it shall become alike lawful in all the states
old as well as new
north as well as south
have we no tendency to the latter condition
let any one who doubts
carefully contemplate that now almost complete legal combination piece of machinery
so to speak compounded of the nebraska doctrine and the dred scott decision
let him consider
not only what work the machinery is adapted to do
and how well adapted
but also let him study the history of its construction
and trace
if he can
or rather fail
if he can
to trace the evidences of design
and concert of action
among its chief architects
from the beginning
the new year of 1854 found slavery excluded from more than half the states by state constitutions
and from most of the national territory by congressional prohibition
four days later
commenced the struggle which ended in repealing that congressional prohibition
this opened all the national territory to slavery
and was the first point gained
so far
congress only had acted
and an indorsement by the people
real or apparent
was indispensable to save the point already gained
and give chance for more
this necessity had not been overlooked
but had been provided for
as well as might be
in the notable argument of squatter sovereignty
otherwise called sacred right of self government
which latter phrase
though expressive of the only rightful basis of any government
was so perverted in this attempted use of it as to amount to just this
that if any one man choose to enslave another
no third man shall be allowed to object
that argument was incorporated into the nebraska bill itself
in the language which follows
it being the true intent and meaning of this act not to legislate slavery into any territory or state
nor to exclude it therefrom
but to leave the people thereof perfectly free to form and regulate their domestic institutions in their own way
subject only to the constitution of the united states
then opened the roar of loose declamation in favor of squatter sovereignty
and sacred right of self government
but
said opposition members
let us amend the bill so as to expressly declare that the people of the territory may exclude slavery
not we
said the friends of the measure
and down they voted the amendment
while the nebraska bill was passing through congress
a law case
involving the question of a negro's freedom
by reason of his owner having voluntarily taken him first into a free state
and then into a territory covered by the congressional prohibition
and held him as a slave for a long time in each
was passing through the united states circuit court for the district of missouri and both nebraska bill and lawsuit were brought to a decision in the same month of may
the negro's name was dred scott
which name now designates the decision finally made in the case
before the then next presidential election
the law case came to
and was argued in
the supreme court of the united states but the decision of it was deferred until after the election
before the election
senator trumbull
on the floor of the senate
requested the leading advocate of the nebraska bill to state his opinion whether the people of a territory can constitutionally exclude slavery from their limits and the latter answers
that is a question for the supreme court
the election came
buchanan was elected
and the indorsement
such as it was
that was the second point gained
the indorsement
fell short of a clear popular majority by nearly four hundred thousand votes
approximately 10 of the vote and so
was not overwhelmingly reliable and satisfactory
the outgoing president
in his last annual message
as impressively as possible echoed back upon the people the weight and authority of the indorsement
the supreme court met again
did not announce their decision
but ordered a reargument
the presidential inauguration came
and still no decision of the court but the incoming president
in his inaugural address
fervently exhorted the people to abide by the forth coming decision
whatever it might be
in a few days
came the decision
the reputed author of the nebraska bill finds an early occasion to make a speech at this capital indorsing the dred scott decision
and vehemently denouncing all opposition to it
the new president
seizes the early occasion of the silliman letter to indorse and strongly construe that decision
and to express his astonishment that any different view had ever been entertained
at length a squabble springs up between the president and the author of the nebraska bill
on the mere question of fact
whether the lecompton constitution was or was not in any just sense made by the people of kansas and in that quarrel the latter declares that all he wants is a fair vote for the people
and that he cares not whether slavery be voted down or voted up
i do not understand his declaration
that he cares not whether slavery be voted down or voted up
to be intended by him other than as an apt definition of the policy he would impress upon the public mind
the principle for which he declares he has suffered so much
and is ready to suffer to the end
and well may he cling to that principle
if he has any parental feeling
well may he cling to it
that principle is the only shred left of his original nebraska doctrine
under the dred scott decision squatter sovereignty squatted out of existence
tumbled down like temporary scaffolding like the mould at the foundry
served through one blast
and fell back into loose sand helped to carry an election
and then was kicked to the winds
his late joint struggle with the republicans
against the lecompton constitution
involves nothing of the original nebraska doctrine
that struggle was made on a point the right of a people to make their own constitution upon which he and the republicans have never differed
the several points of the dred scott decision
in connection with senator douglas's care not policy
constitute the piece of machinery
in its present state of advancement
this was the third point gained
the working points of that machinery are
that no negro slave
imported as such from africa
and no descendant of such slave
can ever be a citizen of any state
in the sense of that term as used in the constitution of the united states
this point is made in order to deprive the negro
in every possible event
of the benefit of that provision of the united states constitution which declares that the citizens of each state shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of citizens in the several states
secondly
subject to the constitution of the united states
neither congress nor a territorial legislature can exclude slavery from any united states territory
this point is made in order that individual men may fill up the territories with slaves
without danger of losing them as property
and thus to enhance the chances of permanency to the institution through all the future
that whether the holding a negro in actual slavery in a free state makes him free
as against the holder
the united states courts will not decide
but will leave to be decided by the courts of any slave state the negro may be forced into by the master
this point is made
not to be pressed immediately but
if acquiesced in for a while
and apparently indorsed by the people at an election
then to sustain the logical conclusion that what dred scott's master might lawfully do with dred scott
in the free state of illinois
every other master may lawfully do with any other one
or one thousand slaves
in illinois
or in any other free state
auxiliary to all this
and working hand in hand with it
the nebraska doctrine
or what is left of it
is to educate and mould public opinion
at least northern public opinion
not to care whether slavery is voted down or voted up
this shows exactly where we now are and partially
wither we are tending
it will throw additional light on the latter
to go back and run the mind over the string of historical facts already stated
several things will now appear less dark and mysterious than they did when they were transpiring
the people were to be left perfectly free
subject only to the constitution
what the constitution had to do with it
outsiders could not then see
plainly enough now
it was an exactly fitted niche
for the dred scott decision to afterward come in
and declare the perfect freedom of the people to be just no freedom at all
why was the amendment
expressly declaring the right of the people
voted down
plainly enough now
the adoption of it would have spoiled the niche for the dred scott decision
why was the court decision held up
why even a senator's individual opinion withheld
till after the presidential election
plainly enough now
the speaking out then would have damaged the perfectly free argument upon which the election was to be carried
why the outgoing president's felicitation on the indorsement
why the delay of a reargument
why the incoming president's advance exhortation in favor of the decision
these things look like the cautious patting and petting of a spirited horse preparatory to mounting him
when it is dreaded that he may give the rider a fall
and why the hasty after indorsement of the decision by the president and others
we cannot absolutely know that all these exact adaptations are the result of preconcert
but when we see a lot of framed timbers
different portions of which we know have been gotten out at different times and places and by different workmen
and james
for instance
and when we see these timbers joined together
and see they exactly make the frame of a house or a mill
all the tenons and mortises exactly fitting
and all the lengths and proportions of the different pieces exactly adapted to their respective places
and not a piece too many or too few
not omitting even scaffolding
if a single piece be lacking
we see the place in the frame exactly fitted and prepared yet to bring such piece in
in such a case
we find it impossible not to believe that stephen and franklin and roger and james all understood one another from the beginning
and all worked upon a common plan or draft drawn up before the first blow was struck
it should not be overlooked that by the nebraska bill the people of a state as well as territory were to be left perfectly free
subject only to the constitution
why mention a state
they were legislating for territories
and not for or about states
certainly the people of a state are and ought to be subject to the constitution of the united states but why is mention of this lugged into this merely territorial law
why are the people of a territory and the people of a state therein lumped together
and their relation to the constitution therefore treated as being precisely the same
while the opinion of the court
by chief justice taney
in the dred scott case
and the separate opinions of all the concurring judges
expressly declare that the constitution of the united states neither permits congress nor a territorial legislature to exclude slavery from any united states territory
they all omit to declare whether or not the same constitution permits a state
or the people of a state
to exclude it
this is a mere omission but who can be quite sure
if mclean or curtis had sought to get into the opinion a declaration of unlimited power in the people of a state to exclude slavery from their limits
just as chase and mace sought to get such declaration
in behalf of the people of a territory
into the nebraska bill
i ask
who can be quite sure that it would not have been voted down in the one case as it had been in the other
the nearest approach to the point of declaring the power of a state over slavery is made by judge nelson
he approaches it more than once
using the precise idea
and almost the language
of the nebraska act
on one occasion
his exact language is
except in cases where the power is restrained by the constitution of the united states
the law of the state is supreme over the subject of slavery within its jurisdiction
in what cases the power of the states is so restrained by the united states constitution
is left an open question
precisely as the same question
as to the restraint on the power of the territories
was left open in the nebraska act
put this and that together
and we have another nice little niche
which we may
ere long
see filled with another supreme court decision
declaring that the constitution of the united states does not permit a state to exclude slavery from its limits
and this may especially be expected if the doctrine of care not whether slavery be voted down or voted up shall gain upon the public mind sufficiently to give promise that such a decision can be maintained when made
such a decision is all that slavery now lacks of being alike lawful in all the states
welcome or unwelcome
such decision is probably coming
and will soon be upon us
unless the power of the present political dynasty shall be met and overthrown
we shall lie down pleasantly dreaming that the people of missouri are on the verge of making their state free
and we shall awake to the reality instead that the supreme court has made illinois a slave state
to meet and overthrow the power of that dynasty is the work now before all those who would prevent that consummation
that is what we have to do
how can we best do it
there are those who denounce us openly to their friends
and yet whisper to us softly that senator douglas is the aptest instrument there is with which to effect that object
they wish us to infer all
from the fact that he now has a little quarrel with the present head of the dynasty
and that he has regularly voted with us on a single point
upon which he and we have never differed
they remind us that he is a great man
and that the largest of us are very small ones
let this be granted
but a living dog is better than a dead lion
judge douglas
if not a dead lion
for this work is at least a caged and toothless one
how can he oppose the advances of slavery
he don't care anything about it
his avowed mission is impressing the public heart to care nothing about it
a leading douglas democratic newspaper thinks douglas's superior talent will be needed to resist the revival of the african slave trade
does douglas believe an effort to revive that trade is approaching
he has not said so
does he really think so
but if it is
how can he resist it
for years he has labored to prove it a sacred right of white men to take negro slaves into the new territories
can he possibly show that it is less a sacred right to buy them where they can be bought cheapest
and unquestionably they can be bought cheaper in africa than in virginia
he has done all in his power to reduce the whole question of slavery to one of a mere right of property and
as such
how can he oppose the foreign slave trade
how can he refuse that trade in that property shall be perfectly free
unless he does it as a protection to the home production
and as the home producers will probably not ask the protection
he will be wholly without a ground of opposition
senator douglas holds
we know
that a man may rightfully be wiser to day than he was yesterday that he may rightfully change when he finds himself wrong
but can we
for that reason
run ahead
and infer that he will make any particular change
of which he himself has given no intimation
can we safely base our action upon any such vague inference
as ever
i wish not to misrepresent judge douglas's position
question his motives
or do aught that can be personally offensive to him
if ever
he and we can come together on principle so that our cause may have assistance from his great ability
i hope to have interposed no adventitious obstacles
but clearly he is not now with us he does not pretend to be
he does not promise ever to be
our cause
must be intrusted to
and conducted by
its own undoubted friends
those whose hands are free
whose hearts are in the work
who do care for the result
two years ago the republicans of the nation mustered over thirteen hundred thousand strong
we did this under the single impulse of resistance to a common danger
with every external circumstance against us
of strange
and even hostile elements we gathered from the four winds
and formed and fought the battle through
under the constant hot fire of a disciplined
and pampered enemy
did we brave all then to falter now
when that same enemy is wavering
and belligerent
the result is not doubtful
we shall not fail if we stand firm
we shall not fail
wise counsels may accelerate
or mistakes delay it
sooner or later
the victory is sure to come
speech at chicago
july 10
in reply to senator douglas delivered at chicago
saturday evening
july 10
douglas was not present
mr
lincoln was introduced by c
and as he made his appearance he was greeted with a perfect storm of applause
for some moments the enthusiasm continued unabated
at last
when by a wave of his hand partial silence was restored
lincoln said
my fellow citizens
on yesterday evening
upon the occasion of the reception given to senator douglas
i was furnished with a seat very convenient for hearing him
and was otherwise very courteously treated by him and his friends
and for which i thank him and them
during the course of his remarks my name was mentioned in such a way as
i suppose
renders it at least not improper that i should make some sort of reply to him
i shall not attempt to follow him in the precise order in which he addressed the assembled multitude upon that occasion
though i shall perhaps do so in the main
there was one question to which he asked the attention of the crowd
which i deem of somewhat less importance at least of propriety for me to dwell upon than the others
which he brought in near the close of his speech
and which i think it would not be entirely proper for me to omit attending to
and yet if i were not to give some attention to it now
i should probably forget it altogether
while i am upon this subject
allow me to say that i do not intend to indulge in that inconvenient mode sometimes adopted in public speaking
of reading from documents but i shall depart from that rule so far as to read a little scrap from his speech
which notices this first topic of which i shall speak
that is
provided i can find it in the paper
i have made up my mind to appeal to the people against the combination that has been made against me the republican leaders having formed an alliance
an unholy and unnatural alliance
with a portion of unscrupulous federal office holders
i intend to fight that allied army wherever i meet them
i know they deny the alliance but yet these men who are trying to divide the democratic party for the purpose of electing a republican senator in my place are just as much the agents and tools of the supporters of mr
hence i shall deal with this allied army just as the russians dealt with the allies at sebastopol
that is
the russians did not stop to inquire
when they fired a broadside
whether it hit an englishman
a frenchman
or a turk
nor will i stop to inquire
nor shall i hesitate
whether my blows shall hit the republican leaders or their allies
who are holding the federal offices
and yet acting in concert with them
well
is not that very alarming
just to think of it
right at the outset of his canvass
a poor
intelligent gentleman
i am to be slain in this way
my friend the judge is not only
as it turns out
not a dead lion
nor even a living one
he is the rugged russian bear
but if they will have it for he says that we deny it that there is any such alliance
as he says there is
and i don't propose hanging very much upon this question of veracity
but if he will have it that there is such an alliance
that the administration men and we are allied
and we stand in the attitude of english
and turk
he occupying the position of the russian
in that case i beg that he will indulge us while we barely suggest to him that these allies took sebastopol
only a few more words as to this alliance
for my part
i have to say that whether there be such an alliance depends
so far as i know
upon what may be a right definition of the term alliance
if for the republican party to see the other great party to which they are opposed divided among themselves
and not try to stop the division
and rather be glad of it
if that is an alliance
i confess i am in but if it is meant to be said that the republicans had formed an alliance going beyond that
by which there is contribution of money or sacrifice of principle on the one side or the other
so far as the republican party is concerned
if there be any such thing
i protest that i neither know anything of it
nor do i believe it
i will
as i think this branch of the argument is lugged in
i would before i leave it state
for the benefit of those concerned
that one of those same buchanan men did once tell me of an argument that he made for his opposition to judge douglas
he said that a friend of our senator douglas had been talking to him
and had
among other things
said to him
you don't want to beat douglas
yes
said he
i do want to beat him
and i will tell you why
i believe his original nebraska bill was right in the abstract
but it was wrong in the time that it was brought forward
it was wrong in the application to a territory in regard to which the question had been settled it was brought forward at a time when nobody asked him it was tendered to the south when the south had not asked for it
but when they could not well refuse it and for this same reason he forced that question upon our party
it has sunk the best men all over the nation
everywhere and now
when our president
struggling with the difficulties of this man's getting up
has reached the very hardest point to turn in the case
he deserts him and i am for putting him where he will trouble us no more
now
that is not my argument that is not my argument at all
i have only been stating to you the argument of a buchanan man
you will judge if there is any force in it
popular sovereignty
everlasting popular sovereignty
let us for a moment inquire into this vast matter of popular sovereignty
what is popular sovereignty
we recollect that at an early period in the history of this struggle there was another name for the same thing
squatter sovereignty
it was not exactly popular sovereignty
but squatter sovereignty
what do those terms mean
what do those terms mean when used now
and vast credit is taken by our friend the judge in regard to his support of it
when he declares the last years of his life have been
and all the future years of his life shall be
devoted to this matter of popular sovereignty
what is it
it is the sovereignty of the people
what was squatter sovereignty
i suppose
if it had any significance at all
it was the right of the people to govern themselves
to be sovereign in their own affairs while they were squatted down in a country not their own
while they had squatted on a territory that did not belong to them
in the sense that a state belongs to the people who inhabit it
when it belonged to the nation such right to govern themselves was called squatter sovereignty
now
i wish you to mark
what has become of that squatter sovereignty
what has become of it
can you get anybody to tell you now that the people of a territory have any authority to govern themselves
in regard to this mooted question of slavery
before they form a state constitution
no such thing at all although there is a general running fire
and although there has been a hurrah made in every speech on that side
assuming that policy had given the people of a territory the right to govern themselves upon this question
yet the point is dodged
to day it has been decided no more than a year ago it was decided by the supreme court of the united states
and is insisted upon to day that the people of a territory have no right to exclude slavery from a territory that if any one man chooses to take slaves into a territory
all the rest of the people have no right to keep them out
this being so
and this decision being made one of the points that the judge approved
and one in the approval of which he says he means to keep me down
put me down i should not say
for i have never been up
he says he is in favor of it
and sticks to it
and expects to win his battle on that decision
which says that there is no such thing as squatter sovereignty
but that any one man may take slaves into a territory
and all the other men in the territory may be opposed to it
and yet by reason of the constitution they cannot prohibit it
when that is so
how much is left of this vast matter of squatter sovereignty
i should like to know
when we get back
we get to the point of the right of the people to make a constitution
kansas was settled
for example
in 1854
it was a territory yet
without having formed a constitution
in a very regular way
for three years
all this time negro slavery could be taken in by any few individuals
and by that decision of the supreme court
which the judge approves
all the rest of the people cannot keep it out but when they come to make a constitution
they may say they will not have slavery
but it is there they are obliged to tolerate it some way
and all experience shows it will be so
for they will not take the negro slaves and absolutely deprive the owners of them
all experience shows this to be so
all that space of time that runs from the beginning of the settlement of the territory until there is sufficiency of people to make a state constitution
all that portion of time popular sovereignty is given up
the seal is absolutely put down upon it by the court decision
and judge douglas puts his own upon the top of that yet he is appealing to the people to give him vast credit for his devotion to popular sovereignty
when we get to the question of the right of the people to form a state constitution as they please
to form it with slavery or without slavery
if that is anything new
i confess i don't know it
has there ever been a time when anybody said that any other than the people of a territory itself should form a constitution
what is now in it that judge douglas should have fought several years of his life
and pledge himself to fight all the remaining years of his life for
can judge douglas find anybody on earth that said that anybody else should form a constitution for a people
a voice
well
i should like you to name him i should like to know who he was
same voice
john calhoun
no
i never heard of even john calhoun saying such a thing
he insisted on the same principle as judge douglas but his mode of applying it
in fact
was wrong
it is enough for my purpose to ask this crowd whenever a republican said anything against it
they never said anything against it
but they have constantly spoken for it and whoever will undertake to examine the platform
and the speeches of responsible men of the party
and of irresponsible men
if you please
will be unable to find one word from anybody in the republican ranks opposed to that popular sovereignty which judge douglas thinks that he has invented
i suppose that judge douglas will claim
in a little while
that he is the inventor of the idea that the people should govern themselves that nobody ever thought of such a thing until he brought it forward
we do not remember that in that old declaration of independence it is said that
we hold these truths to be self evident
that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights that among these are life
and the pursuit of happiness that to secure these rights
governments are instituted among men
deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed
there is the origin of popular sovereignty
shall come in at this day and claim that he invented it
the lecompton constitution connects itself with this question
for it is in this matter of the lecompton constitution that our friend judge douglas claims such vast credit
i agree that in opposing the lecompton constitution
so far as i can perceive
he was right
i do not deny that at all and
you will readily see why i could not deny it
even if i wanted to
but i do not wish to for all the republicans in the nation opposed it
and they would have opposed it just as much without judge douglas's aid as with it
they had all taken ground against it long before he did
the reason that he urges against that constitution i urged against him a year before
i have the printed speech in my hand
the argument that he makes
why that constitution should not be adopted
that the people were not fairly represented nor allowed to vote
i pointed out in a speech a year ago
which i hold in my hand now
that no fair chance was to be given to the people
read it
read it
i shall not waste your time by trying to read it
read it
read it
gentlemen
reading from speeches is a very tedious business
particularly for an old man that has to put on spectacles
and more so if the man be so tall that he has to bend over to the light
a little more
as to this matter of popular sovereignty and the lecompton constitution
the lecompton constitution
as the judge tells us
was defeated
the defeat of it was a good thing or it was not
he thinks the defeat of it was a good thing
and so do i
and we agree in that
who defeated it
a voice
judge douglas
yes
he furnished himself
and if you suppose he controlled the other democrats that went with him
he furnished three votes while the republicans furnished twenty
that is what he did to defeat it
in the house of representatives he and his friends furnished some twenty votes
and the republicans furnished ninety odd
who was it that did the work
a voice
why
douglas did it
to be sure he did
let us
put that proposition another way
the republicans could not have done it without judge douglas
could he have done it without them
which could have come the nearest to doing it without the other
a voice
who killed the bill
another voice
ground was taken against it by the republicans long before douglas did it
the proportion of opposition to that measure is about five to one
a voice
why don't they come out on it
you don't know what you are talking about
my friend
i am quite willing to answer any gentleman in the crowd who asks an intelligent question
who in all this country has ever found any of our friends of judge douglas's way of thinking
and who have acted upon this main question
that has ever thought of uttering a word in behalf of judge trumbull
a voice
we have
i defy you to show a printed resolution passed in a democratic meeting i take it upon myself to defy any man to show a printed resolution of a democratic meeting
large or small in favor of judge trumbull
or any of the five to one republicans who beat that bill
everything must be for the democrats
they did everything
and the five to the one that really did the thing they snub over
and they do not seem to remember that they have an existence upon the face of the earth
i fear that i shall become tedious
i leave this branch of the subject to take hold of another
i take up that part of judge douglas's speech in which he respectfully attended to me
judge douglas made two points upon my recent speech at springfield
he says they are to be the issues of this campaign
the first one of these points he bases upon the language in a speech which i delivered at springfield
which i believe i can quote correctly from memory
i said there that we are now far into the fifth year since a policy was instituted for the avowed object
and with the confident promise
of putting an end to slavery agitation under the operation of that policy
that agitation has not only not ceased
but has constantly augmented
i believe it will not cease until a crisis shall have been reached and passed
a house divided against itself cannot stand
 i believe this government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free
i do not expect the union to be dissolved
i am quoting from my speech
i do not expect the house to fall
but i do expect it will cease to be divided
it will become all one thing or all the other
either the opponents of slavery will arrest the spread of it and place it where the public mind shall rest in the belief that it is in the course of ultimate extinction
or its advocates will push it forward until it shall become alike lawful in all the states
north as well as south
what is the paragraph
in this paragraph
which i have quoted in your hearing
and to which i ask the attention of all
judge douglas thinks he discovers great political heresy
i want your attention particularly to what he has inferred from it
he says i am in favor of making all the states of this union uniform in all their internal regulations that in all their domestic concerns i am in favor of making them entirely uniform
he draws this inference from the language i have quoted to you
he says that i am in favor of making war by the north upon the south for the extinction of slavery that i am also in favor of inviting as he expresses it the south to a war upon the north for the purpose of nationalizing slavery
it is singular enough
if you will carefully read that passage over
that i did not say that i was in favor of anything in it
i only said what i expected would take place
i made a prediction only
it may have been a foolish one
i did not even say that i desired that slavery should be put in course of ultimate extinction
i do say so now
so there need be no longer any difficulty about that
it may be written down in the great speech
judge douglas informed you that this speech of mine was probably carefully prepared
i admit that it was
i am not master of language i have not a fine education i am not capable of entering into a disquisition upon dialectics
as i believe you call it but i do not believe the language i employed bears any such construction as judge douglas puts upon it
but i don't care about a quibble in regard to words
i know what i meant
and i will not leave this crowd in doubt
if i can explain it to them
what i really meant in the use of that paragraph
i am not
in the first place
unaware that this government has endured eighty two years half slave and half free
i know that
i am tolerably well acquainted with the history of the country
and i know that it has endured eighty two years half slave and half free
i believe and that is what i meant to allude to there i believe it has endured because during all that time
until the introduction of the nebraska bill
the public mind did rest all the time in the belief that slavery was in course of ultimate extinction
that was what gave us the rest that we had through that period of eighty two years
at least
so i believe
i have always hated slavery
i think
as much as any abolitionist
i have been an old line whig
i have always hated it but i have always been quiet about it until this new era of the introduction of the nebraska bill began
i always believed that everybody was against it
and that it was in course of ultimate extinction
pointing to mr
who stood near by
browning thought so the great mass of the nation have rested in the belief that slavery was in course of ultimate extinction
they had reason so to believe
the adoption of the constitution and its attendant history led the people to believe so and that such was the belief of the framers of the constitution itself
why did those old men
about the time of the adoption of the constitution
decree that slavery should not go into the new territory
where it had not already gone
why declare that within twenty years the african slave trade
by which slaves are supplied
might be cut off by congress
why were all these acts
i might enumerate more of these acts but enough
what were they but a clear indication that the framers of the constitution intended and expected the ultimate extinction of that institution
and now
when i say
as i said in my speech that judge douglas has quoted from
when i say that i think the opponents of slavery will resist the farther spread of it
and place it where the public mind shall rest with the belief that it is in course of ultimate extinction
i only mean to say that they will place it where the founders of this government originally placed it
i have said a hundred times
and i have now no inclination to take it back
that i believe there is no right
and ought to be no inclination
in the people of the free states to enter into the slave states and interfere with the question of slavery at all
i have said that always judge douglas has heard me say it
if not quite a hundred times
at least as good as a hundred times and when it is said that i am in favor of interfering with slavery where it exists
i know it is unwarranted by anything i have ever intended
as i believe
by anything i have ever said
by any means
i have ever used language which could fairly be so construed as
i believe i never have
i now correct it
so much
for the inference that judge douglas draws
that i am in favor of setting the sections at war with one another
i know that i never meant any such thing
and i believe that no fair mind can infer any such thing from anything i have ever said
in relation to his inference that i am in favor of a general consolidation of all the local institutions of the various states
i will attend to that for a little while
and try to inquire
if i can
how on earth it could be that any man could draw such an inference from anything i said
i have said
very many times
in judge douglas's hearing
that no man believed more than i in the principle of self government that it lies at the bottom of all my ideas of just government
from beginning to end
i have denied that his use of that term applies properly
but for the thing itself
i deny that any man has ever gone ahead of me in his devotion to the principle
whatever he may have done in efficiency in advocating it
i think that i have said it in your hearing
that i believe each individual is naturally entitled to do as he pleases with himself and the fruit of his labor
so far as it in no wise interferes with any other man's rights that each community as a state has a right to do exactly as it pleases with all the concerns within that state that interfere with the right of no other state and that the general government
upon principle
has no right to interfere with anything other than that general class of things that does concern the whole
i have said that at all times
i have said
as illustrations
that i do not believe in the right of illinois to interfere with the cranberry laws of indiana
the oyster laws of virginia
or the liquor laws of maine
i have said these things over and over again
and i repeat them here as my sentiments
how is it
that judge douglas infers
because i hope to see slavery put where the public mind shall rest in the belief that it is in the course of ultimate extinction
that i am in favor of illinois going over and interfering with the cranberry laws of indiana
what can authorize him to draw any such inference
i suppose there might be one thing that at least enabled him to draw such an inference that would not be true with me or many others
that is
because he looks upon all this matter of slavery as an exceedingly little thing
this matter of keeping one sixth of the population of the whole nation in a state of oppression and tyranny unequaled in the world
he looks upon it as being an exceedingly little thing
only equal to the question of the cranberry laws of indiana as something having no moral question in it as something on a par with the question of whether a man shall pasture his land with cattle
or plant it with tobacco so little and so small a thing that he concludes
if i could desire that anything should be done to bring about the ultimate extinction of that little thing
i must be in favor of bringing about an amalgamation of all the other little things in the union
it so happens and there
i presume
is the foundation of this mistake that the judge thinks thus and it so happens that there is a vast portion of the american people that do not look upon that matter as being this very little thing
they look upon it as a vast moral evil they can prove it as such by the writings of those who gave us the blessings of liberty which we enjoy
and that they so looked upon it
and not as an evil merely confining itself to the states where it is situated and while we agree that
by the constitution we assented to
in the states where it exists
we have no right to interfere with it
because it is in the constitution and we are by both duty and inclination to stick by that constitution
in all its letter and spirit
from beginning to end
so much
as to my disposition my wish to have all the state legislatures blotted out
and to have one consolidated government
and a uniformity of domestic regulations in all the states
by which i suppose it is meant
if we raise corn here
we must make sugar cane grow here too
and we must make those which grow north grow in the south
all this i suppose he understands i am in favor of doing
so much for all this nonsense for i must call it so
the judge can have no issue with me on a question of establishing uniformity in the domestic regulations of the states
a little now on the other point
the dred scott decision
another of the issues he says that is to be made with me is upon his devotion to the dred scott decision
and my opposition to it
i have expressed heretofore
and i now repeat
my opposition to the dred scott decision but i should be allowed to state the nature of that opposition
and i ask your indulgence while i do so
what is fairly implied by the term judge douglas has used
resistance to the decision
i do not resist it
if i wanted to take dred scott from his master
i would be interfering with property
and that terrible difficulty that judge douglas speaks of
of interfering with property
would arise
but i am doing no such thing as that
but all that i am doing is refusing to obey it as a political rule
if i were in congress
and a vote should come up on a question whether slavery should be prohibited in a new territory
in spite of the dred scott decision
i would vote that it should
that is what i should do
judge douglas said last night that before the decision he might advance his opinion
and it might be contrary to the decision when it was made but after it was made he would abide by it until it was reversed
just so
we let this property abide by the decision
but we will try to reverse that decision
we will try to put it where judge douglas would not object
for he says he will obey it until it is reversed
somebody has to reverse that decision
since it is made
and we mean to reverse it
and we mean to do it peaceably
what are the uses of decisions of courts
they have two uses
as rules of property they have two uses
they decide upon the question before the court
they decide in this case that dred scott is a slave
nobody resists that
not only that
but they say to everybody else that persons standing just as dred scott stands are as he is
that is
they say that when a question comes up upon another person
it will be so decided again
unless the court decides in another way
unless the court overrules its decision
we mean to do what we can to have the court decide the other way
that is one thing we mean to try to do
the sacredness that judge douglas throws around this decision is a degree of sacredness that has never been before thrown around any other decision
i have never heard of such a thing
decisions apparently contrary to that decision
or that good lawyers thought were contrary to that decision
have been made by that very court before
it is the first of its kind it is an astonisher in legal history
it is a new wonder of the world
it is based upon falsehood in the main as to the facts allegations of facts upon which it stands are not facts at all in many instances
and no decision made on any question the first instance of a decision made under so many unfavorable circumstances thus placed
has ever been held by the profession as law
and it has always needed confirmation before the lawyers regarded it as settled law
but judge douglas will have it that all hands must take this extraordinary decision
made under these extraordinary circumstances
and give their vote in congress in accordance with it
yield to it
and obey it in every possible sense
circumstances alter cases
do not gentlemen here remember the case of that same supreme court some twenty five or thirty years ago deciding that a national bank was constitutional
i ask
if somebody does not remember that a national bank was declared to be constitutional
such is the truth
whether it be remembered or not
the bank charter ran out
and a recharter was granted by congress
that recharter was laid before general jackson
it was urged upon him
when he denied the constitutionality of the bank
that the supreme court had decided that it was constitutional and general jackson then said that the supreme court had no right to lay down a rule to govern a coordinate branch of the government
the members of which had sworn to support the constitution that each member had sworn to support that constitution as he understood it
i will venture here to say that i have heard judge douglas say that he approved of general jackson for that act
what has now become of all his tirade about resistance of the supreme court
my fellow citizens
getting back a little
for i pass from these points
when judge douglas makes his threat of annihilation upon the alliance
he is cautious to say that that warfare of his is to fall upon the leaders of the republican party
almost every word he utters
and every distinction he makes
has its significance
he means for the republicans who do not count themselves as leaders
to be his friends he makes no fuss over them it is the leaders that he is making war upon
he wants it understood that the mass of the republican party are really his friends
it is only the leaders that are doing something that are intolerant
and that require extermination at his hands
as this is dearly and unquestionably the light in which he presents that matter
i want to ask your attention
addressing myself to the republicans here
that i may ask you some questions as to where you
as the republican party
would be placed if you sustained judge douglas in his present position by a re election
i do not claim
to be unselfish i do not pretend that i would not like to go to the united states senate
i make no such hypocritical pretense but i do say to you that in this mighty issue it is nothing to you nothing to the mass of the people of the nation
whether or not judge douglas or myself shall ever be heard of after this night it may be a trifle to either of us
but in connection with this mighty question
upon which hang the destinies of the nation
it is absolutely nothing
but where will you be placed if you reindorse judge douglas
don't you know how apt he is
how exceedingly anxious he is at all times
to seize upon anything and everything to persuade you that something he has done you did yourselves
he tried to persuade you last night that our illinois legislature instructed him to introduce the nebraska bill
there was nobody in that legislature ever thought of such a thing and when he first introduced the bill
he never thought of it but still he fights furiously for the proposition
and that he did it because there was a standing instruction to our senators to be always introducing nebraska bills
he tells you he is for the cincinnati platform
he tells you he is for the dred scott decision
he tells you
not in his speech last night
but substantially in a former speech
that he cares not if slavery is voted up or down he tells you the struggle on lecompton is past it may come up again or not
and if it does
he stands where he stood when
in spite of him and his opposition
you built up the republican party
if you indorse him
you tell him you do not care whether slavery be voted up or down
and he will close or try to close your mouths with his declaration
repeated by the day
the week
the month
and the year
is that what you mean
cries of no
one voice yes
yes
i have no doubt you who have always been for him
if you mean that
no doubt of that
soberly i have said
and i repeat it
i think
in the position in which judge douglas stood in opposing the lecompton constitution
he was right he does not know that it will return
but if it does we may know where to find him
and if it does not
we may know where to look for him
and that is on the cincinnati platform
i could ask the republican party
after all the hard names that judge douglas has called them by all his repeated charges of their inclination to marry with and hug negroes all his declarations of black republicanism
by the way
we are improving
the black has got rubbed off
but with all that
if he be indorsed by republican votes
where do you stand
you stand ready saddled
and harnessed
and waiting to be driven over to the slavery extension camp of the nation
just ready to be driven over
tied together in a lot
to be driven over
every man with a rope around his neck
that halter being held by judge douglas
that is the question
if republican men have been in earnest in what they have done
i think they had better not do it but i think that the republican party is made up of those who
as far as they can peaceably
will oppose the extension of slavery
and who will hope for its ultimate extinction
if they believe it is wrong in grasping up the new lands of the continent and keeping them from the settlement of free white laborers
who want the land to bring up their families upon if they are in earnest
although they may make a mistake
they will grow restless
and the time will come when they will come back again and reorganize
if not by the same name
at least upon the same principles as their party now has
it is better
to save the work while it is begun
you have done the labor maintain it
keep it
if men choose to serve you
go with them but as you have made up your organization upon principle
stand by it for
as surely as god reigns over you
and has inspired your mind
and given you a sense of propriety
and continues to give you hope
so surely will you still cling to these ideas
and you will at last come back again after your wanderings
merely to do your work over again
we were often
more than once
at least
in the course of judge douglas's speech last night
reminded that this government was made for white men that he believed it was made for white men
that is putting it into a shape in which no one wants to deny it but the judge then goes into his passion for drawing inferences that are not warranted
i protest
now and forever
against that counterfeit logic which presumes that because i did not want a negro woman for a slave
i do necessarily want her for a wife
my understanding is that i need not have her for either
as god made us separate
we can leave one another alone
and do one another much good thereby
there are white men enough to marry all the white women
and enough black men to marry all the black women and in god's name let them be so married
the judge regales us with the terrible enormities that take place by the mixture of races that the inferior race bears the superior down
if we do not let them get together in the territories
they won't mix there
a voice
three cheers for lincoln
the cheers were given with a hearty good will
i should say at least that that is a self evident truth
it happens that we meet together once every year
sometimes about the 4th of july
for some reason or other
these 4th of july gatherings i suppose have their uses
if you will indulge me
i will state what i suppose to be some of them
we are now a mighty nation we are thirty or about thirty millions of people
and we own and inhabit about one fifteenth part of the dry land of the whole earth
we run our memory back over the pages of history for about eighty two years
and we discover that we were then a very small people in point of numbers
vastly inferior to what we are now
with a vastly less extent of country
with vastly less of everything we deem desirable among men we look upon the change as exceedingly advantageous to us and to our posterity
and we fix upon something that happened away back
as in some way or other being connected with this rise of prosperity
we find a race of men living in that day whom we claim as our fathers and grandfathers they were iron men they fought for the principle that they were contending for and we understood that by what they then did it has followed that the degree of prosperity which we now enjoy has come to us
we hold this annual celebration to remind ourselves of all the good done in this process of time
of how it was done and who did it
and how we are historically connected with it and we go from these meetings in better humor with ourselves
we feel more attached the one to the other
and more firmly bound to the country we inhabit
in every way we are better men in the age and race and country in which we live
for these celebrations
but after we have done all this we have not yet reached the whole
there is something else connected with it
we have besides these
men descended by blood from our ancestors among us perhaps half our people who are not descendants at all of these men they are men who have come from europe
and scandinavian
men that have come from europe themselves
or whose ancestors have come hither and settled here
finding themselves our equals in all things
if they look back through this history to trace their connection with those days by blood
they find they have none
they cannot carry themselves back into that glorious epoch and make themselves feel that they are part of us but when they look through that old declaration of independence
they find that those old men say that we hold these truths to be self evident
that all men are created equal and then they feel that that moral sentiment
taught in that day
evidences their relation to those men
that it is the father of all moral principle in them
and that they have a right to claim it as though they were blood of the blood
and flesh of the flesh
of the men who wrote that declaration and so they are
that is the electric cord in that declaration that links the hearts of patriotic and liberty loving men together
that will link those patriotic hearts as long as the love of freedom exists in the minds of men throughout the world
for the purpose of squaring things with this idea of don't care if slavery is voted up or voted down
for sustaining the dred scott decision
for holding that the declaration of independence did not mean anything at all
we have judge douglas giving his exposition of what the declaration of independence means
and we have him saying that the people of america are equal to the people of england
according to his construction
you germans are not connected with it
i ask you in all soberness if all these things
if indulged in
if ratified
if confirmed and indorsed
if taught to our children
and repeated to them
do not tend to rub out the sentiment of liberty in the country
and to transform this government into a government of some other form
those arguments that are made
that the inferior race are to be treated with as much allowance as they are capable of enjoying that as much is to be done for them as their condition will allow
what are these arguments
they are the arguments that kings have made for enslaving the people in all ages of the world
you will find that all the arguments in favor of kingcraft were of this class they always bestrode the necks of the people not that they wanted to do it
but because the people were better off for being ridden
that is their argument
and this argument of the judge is the same old serpent that says
you work
and i eat you toil
and i will enjoy the fruits of it
turn in whatever way you will
whether it come from the mouth of a king
an excuse for enslaving the people of his country
or from the mouth of men of one race as a reason for enslaving the men of another race
it is all the same old serpent and i hold
if that course of argumentation that is made for the purpose of convincing the public mind that we should not care about this should be granted
it does not stop with the negro
i should like to know
if taking this old declaration of independence
which declares that all men are equal upon principle
and making exceptions to it
where will it stop
if one man says it does not mean a negro
why not another say it does not mean some other man
if that declaration is not the truth
let us get the statute book
in which we find it
and tear it out
who is so bold as to do it
if it is not true
let us tear it out
cries of no
let us stick to it
then let us stand firmly by it
it may be argued that there are certain conditions that make necessities and impose them upon us and to the extent that a necessity is imposed upon a man
he must submit to it
i think that was the condition in which we found ourselves when we established this government
we had slavery among us
we could not get our constitution unless we permitted them to remain in slavery
we could not secure the good we did secure if we grasped for more and having by necessity submitted to that much
it does not destroy the principle that is the charter of our liberties
let that charter stand as our standard
my friend has said to me that i am a poor hand to quote scripture
i will try it again
it is said in one of the admonitions of our lord
as your father in heaven is perfect
be ye also perfect
the savior
i suppose
did not expect that any human creature could be perfect as the father in heaven but he said
as your father in heaven is perfect
be ye also perfect
he set that up as a standard and he who did most towards reaching that standard attained the highest degree of moral perfection
so i say in relation to the principle that all men are created equal
let it be as nearly reached as we can
if we cannot give freedom to every creature
let us do nothing that will impose slavery upon any other creature
let us then turn this government back into the channel in which the framers of the constitution originally placed it
let us stand firmly by each other
if we do not do so
we are turning in the contrary direction
that our friend judge douglas proposes not intentionally as working in the traces tends to make this one universal slave nation
he is one that runs in that direction
and as such i resist him
my friends
i have detained you about as long as i desired to do
and i have only to say
let us discard all this quibbling about this man and the other man
this race and that race and the other race being inferior
and therefore they must be placed in an inferior position discarding our standard that we have left us
let us discard all these things
and unite as one people throughout this land
until we shall once more stand up declaring that all men are created equal
my friends
i could not
without launching off upon some new topic
which would detain you too long
continue to night
i thank you for this most extensive audience that you have furnished me to night
i leave you
hoping that the lamp of liberty will burn in your bosoms until there shall no longer be a doubt that all men are created free and equal
speech at springfield
july 17
delivered saturday evening mr
douglas was not present
fellow citizens
another election
which is deemed an important one
is approaching
as i suppose
the republican party will
without much difficulty
elect their state ticket
but in regard to the legislature
the republicans
labor under some disadvantages
in the first place
we have a legislature to elect upon an apportionment of the representation made several years ago
when the proportion of the population was far greater in the south as compared with the north than it now is and inasmuch as our opponents hold almost entire sway in the south
and we a correspondingly large majority in the north
the fact that we are now to be represented as we were years ago
when the population was different
is to us a very great disadvantage
we had in the year 1855
according to law
a census
or enumeration of the inhabitants
taken for the purpose of a new apportionment of representation
we know what a fair apportionment of representation upon that census would give us
we know that it could not
if fairly made
fail to give the republican party from six to ten more members of the legislature than they can probably get as the law now stands
it so happened at the last session of the legislature that our opponents
holding the control of both branches of the legislature
steadily refused to give us such an apportionment as we were rightly entitled to have upon the census already taken
the legislature steadily refused to give us such an apportionment as we were rightfully entitled to have upon the census taken of the population of the state
the legislature would pass no bill upon that subject
except such as was at least as unfair to us as the old one
and in which
in some instances
two men in the democratic regions were allowed to go as far toward sending a member to the legislature as three were in the republican regions
comparison was made at the time as to representative and senatorial districts
which completely demonstrated that such was the fact
such a bill was passed and tendered to the republican governor for his signature but
principally for the reasons i have stated
he withheld his approval
and the bill fell without becoming a law
another disadvantage under which we labor is that there are one or two democratic senators who will be members of the next legislature
and will vote for the election of senator
who are holding over in districts in which we could
on all reasonable calculation
elect men of our own
if we only had the chance of an election
when we consider that there are but twenty five senators in the senate
taking two from the side where they rightfully belong
and adding them to the other
is to us a disadvantage not to be lightly regarded
so it is we have this to contend with
perhaps there is no ground of complaint on our part
in attending to the many things involved in the last general election for president
superintendent of public instruction
members of congress
of the legislature
county officers
and so on
we allowed these things to happen by want of sufficient attention
and we have no cause to complain of our adversaries
so far as this matter is concerned
but we have some cause to complain of the refusal to give us a fair apportionment
there is still another disadvantage under which we labor
and to which i will ask your attention
it arises out of the relative positions of the two persons who stand before the state as candidates for the senate
senator douglas is of world wide renown
all the anxious politicians of his party
or who have been of his party for years past
have been looking upon him as certainly
at no distant day
to be the president of the united states
they have seen in his round
fruitful face post offices
and cabinet appointments
charge ships and foreign missions bursting and sprouting out in wonderful exuberance
ready to be laid hold of by their greedy hands
and as they have been gazing upon this attractive picture so long
they cannot
in the little distraction that has taken place in the party
bring themselves to give up the charming hope but with greedier anxiety they rush about him
sustain him
and give him marches
triumphal entries
and receptions beyond what even in the days of his highest prosperity they could have brought about in his favor
on the contrary
nobody has ever expected me to be president
in my poor
lank face
nobody has ever seen that any cabbages were sprouting out
these are disadvantages all
taken together
that the republicans labor under
we have to fight this battle upon principle
and upon principle alone
i am
in a certain sense
made the standard bearer in behalf of the republicans
i was made so merely because there had to be some one so placed
i being in nowise preferable to any other one of twenty five
perhaps a hundred
we have in the republican ranks
then i say i wish it to be distinctly understood and borne in mind that we have to fight this battle without many perhaps without any of the external aids which are brought to bear against us
so i hope those with whom i am surrounded have principle enough to nerve themselves for the task
and leave nothing undone that can be fairly done to bring about the right result
after senator douglas left washington
as his movements were made known by the public prints
he tarried a considerable time in the city of new york and it was heralded that
like another napoleon
he was lying by and framing the plan of his campaign
it was telegraphed to washington city
and published in the union
that he was framing his plan for the purpose of going to illinois to pounce upon and annihilate the treasonable and disunion speech which lincoln had made here on the 16th of june
i do suppose that the judge really spent some time in new york maturing the plan of the campaign
as his friends heralded for him
i have been able
by noting his movements since his arrival in illinois
to discover evidences confirmatory of that allegation
i think i have been able to see what are the material points of that plan
i will
for a little while
ask your attention to some of them
what i shall point out
though not showing the whole plan
the main points
as i suppose
they are not very numerous
the first is popular sovereignty
the second and third are attacks upon my speech made on the 16th of june
out of these three points drawing within the range of popular sovereignty the question of the lecompton constitution he makes his principal assault
upon these his successive speeches are substantially one and the same
on this matter of popular sovereignty i wish to be a little careful
auxiliary to these main points
to be sure
are their thunderings of cannon
their marching and music
their fizzlegigs and fireworks but i will not waste time with them
they are but the little trappings of the campaign
coming to the substance
the first point
popular sovereignty
it is to be labeled upon the cars in which he travels put upon the hacks he rides in to be flaunted upon the arches he passes under
and the banners which wave over him
it is to be dished up in as many varieties as a french cook can produce soups from potatoes
as this is so great a staple of the plan of the campaign
it is worth while to examine it carefully and if we examine only a very little
and do not allow ourselves to be misled
we shall be able to see that the whole thing is the most arrant quixotism that was ever enacted before a community
what is the matter of popular sovereignty
the first thing
in order to understand it
is to get a good definition of what it is
and after that to see how it is applied
i suppose almost every one knows that
in this controversy
whatever has been said has had reference to the question of negro slavery
we have not been in a controversy about the right of the people to govern themselves in the ordinary matters of domestic concern in the states and territories
in one of his late messages i think when he sent up the lecompton constitution urged that the main point to which the public attention had been directed was not in regard to the great variety of small domestic matters
but was directed to the question of negro slavery and he asserts that if the people had had a fair chance to vote on that question there was no reasonable ground of objection in regard to minor questions
while i think that the people had not had given
or offered
them a fair chance upon that slavery question
if there had been a fair submission to a vote upon that main question
the president's proposition would have been true to the utmost
when hereafter i speak of popular sovereignty
i wish to be understood as applying what i say to the question of slavery only
not to other minor domestic matters of a territory or a state
does judge douglas
when he says that several of the past years of his life have been devoted to the question of popular sovereignty
and that all the remainder of his life shall be devoted to it
does he mean to say that he has been devoting his life to securing to the people of the territories the right to exclude slavery from the territories
if he means so to say he means to deceive because he and every one knows that the decision of the supreme court
which he approves and makes especial ground of attack upon me for disapproving
forbids the people of a territory to exclude slavery
this covers the whole ground
from the settlement of a territory till it reaches the degree of maturity entitling it to form a state constitution
so far as all that ground is concerned
the judge is not sustaining popular sovereignty
but absolutely opposing it
he sustains the decision which declares that the popular will of the territory has no constitutional power to exclude slavery during their territorial existence
this being so
the period of time from the first settlement of a territory till it reaches the point of forming a state constitution is not the thing that the judge has fought for or is fighting for
on the contrary
he has fought for
and is fighting for
the thing that annihilates and crushes out that same popular sovereignty
so much being disposed of
what is left
he is contending for the right of the people
when they come to make a state constitution
to make it for themselves
and precisely as best suits themselves
i say again
that is quixotic
i defy contradiction when i declare that the judge can find no one to oppose him on that proposition
i repeat
there is nobody opposing that proposition on principle
let me not be misunderstood
i know that
with reference to the lecompton constitution
i may be misunderstood but when you understand me correctly
my proposition will be true and accurate
nobody is opposing
or has opposed
the right of the people
when they form a constitution
to form it for themselves
buchanan and his friends have not done it they
as well as the republicans and the anti lecompton democrats
have not done it but on the contrary
they together have insisted on the right of the people to form a constitution for themselves
the difference between the buchanan men on the one hand
and the douglas men and the republicans on the other
has not been on a question of principle
but on a question of fact
the dispute was upon the question of fact
whether the lecompton constitution had been fairly formed by the people or not
buchanan and his friends have not contended for the contrary principle any more than the douglas men or the republicans
they have insisted that whatever of small irregularities existed in getting up the lecompton constitution were such as happen in the settlement of all new territories
the question was
was it a fair emanation of the people
it was a question of fact
and not of principle
as to the principle
all were agreed
judge douglas voted with the republicans upon that matter of fact
he and they
by their voices and votes
denied that it was a fair emanation of the people
the administration affirmed that it was
with respect to the evidence bearing upon that question of fact
i readily agree that judge douglas and the republicans had the right on their side
and that the administration was wrong
but i state again that
as a matter of principle
there is no dispute upon the right of a people in a territory
merging into a state
to form a constitution for themselves without outside interference from any quarter
this being so
what is judge douglas going to spend his life for
is he going to spend his life in maintaining a principle that nobody on earth opposes
does he expect to stand up in majestic dignity
and go through his apotheosis and become a god in the maintaining of a principle which neither man nor mouse in all god's creation is opposing
now something in regard to the lecompton constitution more specially for i pass from this other question of popular sovereignty as the most arrant humbug that has ever been attempted on an intelligent community
as to the lecompton constitution
i have already said that on the question of fact
as to whether it was a fair emanation of the people or not
judge douglas
with the republicans and some americans
had greatly the argument against the administration and while i repeat this
i wish to know what there is in the opposition of judge douglas to the lecompton constitution that entitles him to be considered the only opponent to it
as being par excellence the very quintessence of that opposition
i agree to the rightfulness of his opposition
he in the senate and his class of men there formed the number three and no more
in the house of representatives his class of men the anti lecompton democrats formed a number of about twenty
it took one hundred and twenty to defeat the measure
against one hundred and twelve
of the votes of that one hundred and twenty
judge douglas's friends furnished twenty
to add to which there were six americans and ninety four republicans
i do not say that i am precisely accurate in their numbers
but i am sufficiently so for any use i am making of it
why is it that twenty shall be entitled to all the credit of doing that work
and the hundred none of it
as judge douglas says
the honor is to be divided and due credit is to be given to other parties
why is just so much given as is consonant with the wishes
the interests
and advancement of the twenty
my understanding is
when a common job is done
or a common enterprise prosecuted
if i put in five dollars to your one
i have a right to take out five dollars to your one
but he does not so understand it
he declares the dividend of credit for defeating lecompton upon a basis which seems unprecedented and incomprehensible
let us see
lecompton in the raw was defeated
it afterward took a sort of cooked up shape
and was passed in the english bill
it is said by the judge that the defeat was a good and proper thing
if it was a good thing
why is he entitled to more credit than others for the performance of that good act
unless there was something in the antecedents of the republicans that might induce every one to expect them to join in that good work
and at the same time something leading them to doubt that he would
does he place his superior claim to credit on the ground that he performed a good act which was never expected of him
he says i have a proneness for quoting scripture
if i should do so now
it occurs that perhaps he places himself somewhat upon the ground of the parable of the lost sheep which went astray upon the mountains
and when the owner of the hundred sheep found the one that was lost
and threw it upon his shoulders and came home rejoicing
it was said that there was more rejoicing over the one sheep that was lost and had been found than over the ninety and nine in the fold
the application is made by the saviour in this parable
i say unto you
there is more rejoicing in heaven over one sinner that repenteth
than over ninety and nine just persons that need no repentance
and now
if the judge claims the benefit of this parable
let him repent
let him not come up here and say
i am the only just person and you are the ninety nine sinners
repentance before forgiveness is a provision of the christian system
and on that condition alone will the republicans grant his forgiveness
how will he prove that we have ever occupied a different position in regard to the lecompton constitution or any principle in it
he says he did not make his opposition on the ground as to whether it was a free or slave constitution
and he would have you understand that the republicans made their opposition because it ultimately became a slave constitution
to make proof in favor of himself on this point
he reminds us that he opposed lecompton before the vote was taken declaring whether the state was to be free or slave
but he forgets to say that our republican senator
made a speech against lecompton even before he did
why did he oppose it
as he declares
because the members of the convention who framed it were not fairly elected by the people that the people were not allowed to vote unless they had been registered and that the people of whole counties
some instances
were not registered
for these reasons he declares the constitution was not an emanation
in any true sense
from the people
he also has an additional objection as to the mode of submitting the constitution back to the people
but bearing on the question of whether the delegates were fairly elected
a speech of his
made something more than twelve months ago
from this stand
becomes important
it was made a little while before the election of the delegates who made lecompton
in that speech he declared there was every reason to hope and believe the election would be fair and if any one failed to vote
it would be his own culpable fault
a few days after
made a sort of answer to that speech
in that answer i made
the very argument with which he combated his lecompton adversaries in the senate last winter
i pointed to the facts that the people could not vote without being registered
and that the time for registering had gone by
i commented on it as wonderful that judge douglas could be ignorant of these facts which every one else in the nation so well knew
i now pass from popular sovereignty and lecompton
i may have occasion to refer to one or both
when he was preparing his plan of campaign
in new york
as appears by two speeches i have heard him deliver since his arrival in illinois
he gave special attention to a speech of mine
delivered here on the 16th of june last
he says that he carefully read that speech
he told us that at chicago a week ago last night and he repeated it at bloomington last night
he repeated it again to day
though i did not hear him
in the first two places chicago and bloomington i heard him to day i did not
he said he had carefully examined that speech
he did not say but there is no reasonable doubt it was when he was in new york preparing his plan of campaign
i am glad he did read it carefully
he says it was evidently prepared with great care
i freely admit it was prepared with care
i claim not to be more free from errors than others
perhaps scarcely so much but i was very careful not to put anything in that speech as a matter of fact
or make any inferences
which did not appear to me to be true and fully warrantable
if i had made any mistake
i was willing to be corrected if i had drawn any inference in regard to judge douglas or any one else which was not warranted
i was fully prepared to modify it as soon as discovered
i planted myself upon the truth and the truth only
so far as i knew it
or could be brought to know it
having made that speech with the most kindly feelings toward judge douglas
as manifested therein
i was gratified when i found that he had carefully examined it
and had detected no error of fact
nor any inference against him
nor any misrepresentations of which he thought fit to complain
in neither of the two speeches i have mentioned did he make any such complaint
i will thank any one who will inform me that he
in his speech to day
pointed out anything i had stated respecting him as being erroneous
i presume there is no such thing
i have reason to be gratified that the care and caution used in that speech left it so that he
most of all others interested in discovering error
has not been able to point out one thing against him which he could say was wrong
he seizes upon the doctrines he supposes to be included in that speech
and declares that upon them will turn the issues of this campaign
he then quotes
or attempts to quote
from my speech
i will not say that he wilfully misquotes
but he does fail to quote accurately
his attempt at quoting is from a passage which i believe i can quote accurately from memory
i shall make the quotation now
with some comments upon it
as i have already said
in order that the judge shall be left entirely without excuse for misrepresenting me
i do so now
as i hope
for the last time
i do this in great caution
in order that if he repeats his misrepresentation it shall be plain to all that he does so wilfully
after all
he still persists
i shall be compelled to reconstruct the course i have marked out for myself
and draw upon such humble resources
as i have
for a new course
better suited to the real exigencies of the case
i set out in this campaign with the intention of conducting it strictly as a gentleman
in substance at least
if not in the outside polish
the latter i shall never be but that which constitutes the inside of a gentleman i hope i understand
and am not less inclined to practice than others
it was my purpose and expectation that this canvass would be conducted upon principle
and with fairness on both sides
and it shall not be my fault if this purpose and expectation shall be given up
he charges
in substance
that i invite a war of sections that i propose all the local institutions of the different states shall become consolidated and uniform
what is there in the language of that speech which expresses such purpose or bears such construction
i have again and again said that i would not enter into any of the states to disturb the institution of slavery
judge douglas said
at bloomington
that i used language most able and ingenious for concealing what i really meant and that while i had protested against entering into the slave states
i nevertheless did mean to go on the banks of the ohio and throw missiles into kentucky
to disturb them in their domestic institutions
i said in that speech
and i meant no more
that the institution of slavery ought to be placed in the very attitude where the framers of this government placed it and left it
i do not understand that the framers of our constitution left the people of the free states in the attitude of firing bombs or shells into the slave states
i was not using that passage for the purpose for which he infers i did use it
i said
we are now far advanced into the fifth year since a policy was created for the avowed object and with the confident promise of putting an end to slavery agitation
under the operation of that policy that agitation has not only not ceased
but has constantly augmented
in my opinion it will not cease till a crisis shall have been reached and passed
a house divided against itself cannot stand
 i believe that this government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free it will become all one thing or all the other
either the opponents of slavery will arrest the further spread of it
and place it where the public mind shall rest in the belief that it is in the course of ultimate extinction
or its advocates will push it forward till it shall become alike lawful in all the states
old as well as new
north as well as south
now
you all see
from that quotation
i did not express my wish on anything
in that passage i indicated no wish or purpose of my own i simply expressed my expectation
cannot the judge perceive a distinction between a purpose and an expectation
i have often expressed an expectation to die
but i have never expressed a wish to die
i said at chicago
and now repeat
that i am quite aware this government has endured
half slave and half free
for eighty two years
i understand that little bit of history
i expressed the opinion i did because i perceived or thought i perceived a new set of causes introduced
i did say at chicago
in my speech there
that i do wish to see the spread of slavery arrested
and to see it placed where the public mind shall rest in the belief that it is in the course of ultimate extinction
i said that because i supposed
when the public mind shall rest in that belief
we shall have peace on the slavery question
i have believed and now believe the public mind did rest on that belief up to the introduction of the nebraska bill
although i have ever been opposed to slavery
so far i rested in the hope and belief that it was in the course of ultimate extinction
for that reason it had been a minor question with me
i might have been mistaken but i had believed
and now believe
that the whole public mind
that is
the mind of the great majority
had rested in that belief up to the repeal of the missouri compromise
but upon that event i became convinced that either i had been resting in a delusion
or the institution was being placed on a new basis
a basis for making it perpetual
and universal
subsequent events have greatly confirmed me in that belief
i believe that bill to be the beginning of a conspiracy for that purpose
so believing
i have since then considered that question a paramount one
so believing
i thought the public mind will never rest till the power of congress to restrict the spread of it shall again be acknowledged and exercised on the one hand or
on the other
all resistance be entirely crushed out
i have expressed that opinion
and i entertain it to night
it is denied that there is any tendency to the nationalization of slavery in these states
of south carolina
in one of his speeches
when they were presenting him canes
silver plate
gold pitchers
and the like
for assaulting senator sumner
distinctly affirmed his opinion that when this constitution was formed it was the belief of no man that slavery would last to the present day
he said
what i think
that the framers of our constitution placed the institution of slavery where the public mind rested in the hope that it was in the course of ultimate extinction
but he went on to say that the men of the present age
by their experience
have become wiser than the framers of the constitution
and the invention of the cotton gin had made the perpetuity of slavery a necessity in this country
as another piece of evidence tending to this same point
quite recently in virginia
a man the owner of slaves made a will providing that after his death certain of his slaves should have their freedom if they should so choose
and go to liberia
rather than remain in slavery
they chose to be liberated
but the persons to whom they would descend as property claimed them as slaves
a suit was instituted
which finally came to the supreme court of virginia
and was therein decided against the slaves upon the ground that a negro cannot make a choice that they had no legal power to choose
could not perform the condition upon which their freedom depended
i do not mention this with any purpose of criticizing it
but to connect it with the arguments as affording additional evidence of the change of sentiment upon this question of slavery in the direction of making it perpetual and national
i argue now as i did before
that there is such a tendency and i am backed
not merely by the facts
but by the open confession in the slave states
and now as to the judge's inference that because i wish to see slavery placed in the course of ultimate extinction
placed where our fathers originally placed it
i wish to annihilate the state legislatures
to force cotton to grow upon the tops of the green mountains
to freeze ice in florida
to cut lumber on the broad illinois prairie
that i am in favor of all these ridiculous and impossible things
it seems to me it is a complete answer to all this to ask if
when congress did have the fashion of restricting slavery from free territory when courts did have the fashion of deciding that taking a slave into a free country made him free
i say it is a sufficient answer to ask if any of this ridiculous nonsense about consolidation and uniformity did actually follow
who heard of any such thing because of the ordinance of '87
because of the missouri restriction
because of the numerous court decisions of that character
as to the dred scott decision for upon that he makes his last point at me
he boldly takes ground in favor of that decision
this is one half the onslaught
and one third of the entire plan of the campaign
i am opposed to that decision in a certain sense
but not in the sense which he puts it
i say that in so far as it decided in favor of dred scott's master
and against dred scott and his family
i do not propose to disturb or resist the decision
i never have proposed to do any such thing
i think that in respect for judicial authority my humble history would not suffer in comparison with that of judge douglas
he would have the citizen conform his vote to that decision the member of congress
his the president
his use of the veto power
he would make it a rule of political action for the people and all the departments of the government
i would not
by resisting it as a political rule
i disturb no right of property
create no disorder
excite no mobs
when he spoke at chicago
on friday evening of last week
he made this same point upon me
on saturday evening i replied
and reminded him of a supreme court decision which he opposed for at least several years
last night
at bloomington
he took some notice of that reply
but entirely forgot to remember that part of it
he renews his onslaught upon me
forgetting to remember that i have turned the tables against himself on that very point
i renew the effort to draw his attention to it
i wish to stand erect before the country
as well as judge douglas
on this question of judicial authority and therefore i add something to the authority in favor of my own position
i wish to show that i am sustained by authority
in addition to that heretofore presented
i do not expect to convince the judge
it is part of the plan of his campaign
and he will cling to it with a desperate grip
even turn it upon him
the sharp point against him
and gaff him through
he will still cling to it till he can invent some new dodge to take the place of it
in public speaking it is tedious reading from documents but i must beg to indulge the practice to a limited extent
i shall read from a letter written by mr
jefferson in 1820
and now to be found in the seventh volume of his correspondence
at page 177
it seems he had been presented by a gentleman of the name of jarvis with a book
or essay
or periodical
called the republican
and he was writing in acknowledgment of the present
and noting some of its contents
after expressing the hope that the work will produce a favorable effect upon the minds of the young
he proceeds to say
that it will have this tendency may be expected
and for that reason i feel an urgency to note what i deem an error in it
the more requiring notice as your opinion is strengthened by that of many others
you seem
in pages 84 and 148
to consider the judges as the ultimate arbiters of all constitutional questions
a very dangerous doctrine indeed
and one which would place us under the despotism of an oligarchy
our judges are as honest as other men
and not more so
they have
with others
the same passions for party
for power
and the privilege of their corps
their maxim is
boni judicis est ampliare jurisdictionem' and their power is the more dangerous as they are in office for life
and not responsible
as the other functionaries are
to the elective control
the constitution has erected no such single tribunal
knowing that
to whatever hands confided
with the corruptions of time and party
its members would become despots
it has more wisely made all the departments co equal and co sovereign with themselves
thus we see the power claimed for the supreme court by judge douglas
jefferson holds
would reduce us to the despotism of an oligarchy
i have said no more than this
in fact
never quite so much as this at least i am sustained by mr
let us go a little further
you remember we once had a national bank
some one owed the bank a debt he was sued
and sought to avoid payment on the ground that the bank was unconstitutional
the case went to the supreme court
and therein it was decided that the bank was constitutional
the whole democratic party revolted against that decision
general jackson himself asserted that he
as president
would not be bound to hold a national bank to be constitutional
even though the court had decided it to be so
he fell in precisely with the view of mr
and acted upon it under his official oath
in vetoing a charter for a national bank
the declaration that congress does not possess this constitutional power to charter a bank has gone into the democratic platform
at their national conventions
and was brought forward and reaffirmed in their last convention at cincinnati
they have contended for that declaration
in the very teeth of the supreme court
for more than a quarter of a century
in fact
they have reduced the decision to an absolute nullity
that decision
i repeat
is repudiated in the cincinnati platform and still
as if to show that effrontery can go no further
judge douglas vaunts in the very speeches in which he denounces me for opposing the dred scott decision that he stands on the cincinnati platform
i wish to know what the judge can charge upon me
with respect to decisions of the supreme court
which does not lie in all its length
and proportions at his own door
the plain truth is simply this
judge douglas is for supreme court decisions when he likes and against them when he does not like them
he is for the dred scott decision because it tends to nationalize slavery because it is part of the original combination for that object
it so happens
singularly enough
that i never stood opposed to a decision of the supreme court till this
on the contrary
i have no recollection that he was ever particularly in favor of one till this
he never was in favor of any nor opposed to any
till the present one
which helps to nationalize slavery
free men of sangamon
free men of illinois
free men everywhere
judge ye between him and me upon this issue
he says this dred scott case is a very small matter at most
that it has no practical effect that at best
or rather
i suppose
at worst
it is but an abstraction
i submit that the proposition that the thing which determines whether a man is free or a slave is rather concrete than abstract
i think you would conclude that it was
if your liberty depended upon it
and so would judge douglas
if his liberty depended upon it
but suppose it was on the question of spreading slavery over the new territories that he considers it as being merely an abstract matter
and one of no practical importance
how has the planting of slavery in new countries always been effected
it has now been decided that slavery cannot be kept out of our new territories by any legal means
in what do our new territories now differ in this respect from the old colonies when slavery was first planted within them
it was planted
as mr
clay once declared
and as history proves true
by individual men
in spite of the wishes of the people the mother government refusing to prohibit it
and withholding from the people of the colonies the authority to prohibit it for themselves
clay says this was one of the great and just causes of complaint against great britain by the colonies
and the best apology we can now make for having the institution amongst us
in that precise condition our nebraska politicians have at last succeeded in placing our own new territories the government will not prohibit slavery within them
nor allow the people to prohibit it
i defy any man to find any difference between the policy which originally planted slavery in these colonies and that policy which now prevails in our new territories
if it does not go into them
it is only because no individual wishes it to go
the judge indulged himself doubtless to day with the question as to what i am going to do with or about the dred scott decision
will you please tell me what you did about the bank decision
will you not graciously allow us to do with the dred scott decision precisely as you did with the bank decision
you succeeded in breaking down the moral effect of that decision
did you find it necessary to amend the constitution
or to set up a court of negroes in order to do it
there is one other point
judge douglas has a very affectionate leaning toward the americans and old whigs
last evening
in a sort of weeping tone
he described to us a death bed scene
he had been called to the side of mr
in his last moments
in order that the genius of popular sovereignty might duly descend from the dying man and settle upon him
the living and most worthy successor
he could do no less than promise that he would devote the remainder of his life to popular sovereignty and then the great statesman departs in peace
by this part of the plan of the campaign the judge has evidently promised himself that tears shall be drawn down the cheeks of all old whigs
as large as half grown apples
was mentioned but it did not quite come to a death bed scene as to him
it would be amusing
if it were not disgusting
to see how quick these compromise breakers administer on the political effects of their dead adversaries
trumping up claims never before heard of
and dividing the assets among themselves
if i should be found dead to morrow morning
nothing but my insignificance could prevent a speech being made on my authority
before the end of next week
it so happens that in that popular sovereignty with which mr
clay was identified
the missouri compromise was expressly reversed and it was a little singular if mr
clay cast his mantle upon judge douglas on purpose to have that compromise repealed
the judge did not keep faith with mr
clay when he first brought in his nebraska bill
he left the missouri compromise unrepealed
and in his report accompanying the bill he told the world he did it on purpose
the manes of mr
clay must have been in great agony till thirty days later
when popular sovereignty stood forth in all its glory
one more thing
last night judge douglas tormented himself with horrors about my disposition to make negroes perfectly equal with white men in social and political relations
he did not stop to show that i have said any such thing
or that it legitimately follows from anything i have said
but he rushes on with his assertions
i adhere to the declaration of independence
if judge douglas and his friends are not willing to stand by it
let them come up and amend it
let them make it read that all men are created equal except negroes
let us have it decided whether the declaration of independence
in this blessed year of 1858
shall be thus amended
in his construction of the declaration last year
he said it only meant that americans in america were equal to englishmen in england
when i pointed out to him that by that rule he excludes the germans
the irish
the portuguese
and all the other people who have come among us since the revolution
he reconstructs his construction
in his last speech he tells us it meant europeans
i press him a little further
and ask if it meant to include the russians in asia or does he mean to exclude that vast population from the principles of our declaration of independence
i expect ere long he will introduce another amendment to his definition
he is not at all particular
he is satisfied with anything which does not endanger the nationalizing of negro slavery
it may draw white men down
but it must not lift negroes up
who shall say
i am the superior
and you are the inferior
my declarations upon this subject of negro slavery may be misrepresented
but cannot be misunderstood
i have said that i do not understand the declaration to mean that all men were created equal in all respects
they are not our equal in color but i suppose that it does mean to declare that all men are equal in some respects they are equal in their right to life
and the pursuit of happiness
certainly the negro is not our equal in color
perhaps not in many other respects still
in the right to put into his mouth the bread that his own hands have earned
he is the equal of every other man
white or black
in pointing out that more has been given you
you cannot be justified in taking away the little which has been given him
all i ask for the negro is that if you do not like him
let him alone
if god gave him but little
that little let him enjoy
when our government was established we had the institution of slavery among us
we were in a certain sense compelled to tolerate its existence
it was a sort of necessity
we had gone through our struggle and secured our own independence
the framers of the constitution found the institution of slavery amongst their own institutions at the time
they found that by an effort to eradicate it they might lose much of what they had already gained
they were obliged to bow to the necessity
they gave power to congress to abolish the slave trade at the end of twenty years
they also prohibited it in the territories where it did not exist
they did what they could
and yielded to the necessity for the rest
i also yield to all which follows from that necessity
what i would most desire would be the separation of the white and black races
one more point on this springfield speech which judge douglas says he has read so carefully
i expressed my belief in the existence of a conspiracy to perpetuate and nationalize slavery
i did not profess to know it
nor do i now
i showed the part judge douglas had played in the string of facts constituting to my mind the proof of that conspiracy
i showed the parts played by others
i charged that the people had been deceived into carrying the last presidential election
by the impression that the people of the territories might exclude slavery if they chose
when it was known in advance by the conspirators that the court was to decide that neither congress nor the people could so exclude slavery
these charges are more distinctly made than anything else in the speech
judge douglas has carefully read and reread that speech
he has not
so far as i know
contradicted those charges
in the two speeches which i heard he certainly did not
on this own tacit admission
i renew that charge
i charge him with having been a party to that conspiracy and to that deception for the sole purpose of nationalizing slavery

your obedient servant
first joint debate
at ottawa
august 21
1858 mr
lincoln's reply my fellow citizens
when a man hears himself somewhat misrepresented
it provokes him
at least
i find it so with myself but when misrepresentation becomes very gross and palpable
it is more apt to amuse him
the first thing i see fit to notice is the fact that judge douglas alleges
after running through the history of the old democratic and the old whig parties
that judge trumbull and myself made an arrangement in 1854
by which i was to have the place of general shields in the united states senate
and judge trumbull was to have the place of judge douglas
all i have to say upon that subject is that i think no man not even judge douglas can prove it
because it is not true
i have no doubt he is conscientious in saying it
as to those resolutions that he took such a length of time to read
as being the platform of the republican party in 1854
i say i never had anything to do with them
and i think trumbull never had
judge douglas cannot show that either of us ever did have anything to do with them
i believe this is true about those resolutions
there was a call for a convention to form a republican party at springfield
and i think that my friend mr
who is here upon this stand
had a hand in it
i think this is true
and i think if he will remember accurately he will be able to recollect that he tried to get me into it
and i would not go in
i believe it is also true that i went away from springfield when the convention was in session
to attend court in tazewell county
it is true they did place my name
though without authority
upon the committee
and afterward wrote me to attend the meeting of the committee but i refused to do so
and i never had anything to do with that organization
this is the plain truth about all that matter of the resolutions
about this story that judge douglas tells of trumbull bargaining to sell out the old democratic party
and lincoln agreeing to sell out the old whig party
i have the means of knowing about that
judge douglas cannot have and i know there is no substance to it whatever
yet i have no doubt he is conscientious about it
i know that after mr
lovejoy got into the legislature that winter
he complained of me that i had told all the old whigs of his district that the old whig party was good enough for them
and some of them voted against him because i told them so
i have no means of totally disproving such charges as this which the judge makes
a man cannot prove a negative but he has a right to claim that when a man makes an affirmative charge
he must offer some proof to show the truth of what he says
i certainly cannot introduce testimony to show the negative about things
but i have a right to claim that if a man says he knows a thing
then he must show how he knows it
i always have a right to claim this
and it is not satisfactory to me that he may be conscientious on the subject
i hate to waste my time on such things but in regard to that general abolition tilt that judge douglas makes
when he says that i was engaged at that time in selling out and abolitionizing the old whig party
i hope you will permit me to read a part of a printed speech that i made then at peoria
which will show altogether a different view of the position i took in that contest of 1854
put on your specs
mr
i am obliged to do so i am no longer a young man
this is the repeal of the missouri compromise
the foregoing history may not be precisely accurate in every particular
but i am sure it is sufficiently so for all the uses i shall attempt to make of it
and in it we have before us the chief materials enabling us to correctly judge whether the repeal of the missouri compromise is right or wrong
i think
and shall try to show
that it is wrong wrong in its direct effect
letting slavery into kansas and nebraska
and wrong in its prospective principle
allowing it to spread to every other part of the wide world where men can be found inclined to take it
this declared indifference
as i must think
covert real zeal for the spread of slavery
i cannot but hate
i hate it because of the monstrous injustice of slavery itself
i hate it because it deprives our republican example of its just influence in the world
enables the enemies of free institutions
with plausibility
to taunt us as hypocrites causes the real friends of freedom to doubt our sincerity
and especially because it forces so many really good men amongst ourselves into an open war with the very fundamental principles of civil liberty
criticizing the declaration of independence
and insisting that there is no right principle of action but self interest
before proceeding
let me say i think i have no prejudice against the southern people
they are just what we would be in their situation
if slavery did not now exist among them
they would not introduce it
if it did now exist among us
we should not instantly give it up
this i believe of the masses north and south
doubtless there are individuals on both sides who would not hold slaves under any circumstances and others who would gladly introduce slavery anew
if it were out of existence
we know that some southern men do free their slaves
go north
and become tip top abolitionists while some northern ones go south and become most cruel slave masters
when southern people tell us they are no more responsible for the origin of slavery than we
i acknowledge the fact
when it is said that the institution exists
and that it is very difficult to get rid of it
in any satisfactory way
i can understand and appreciate the saying
i will not blame them for not doing what i should not know how to do myself
if all earthly power were given me
i should not know what to do
as to the existing institution
my first impulse would be to free all the slaves and send them to liberia
to their own native land
but a moment's reflection would convince me that whatever of high hope as i think there is there may be in this in the long term
its sudden execution is impossible
if they were all landed there in a day
they would all perish in the next ten days and there are not surplus shipping and surplus money enough in the world to carry them there in many times ten days
what then
free them all and keep them among us as underlings
is it quite certain that this betters their condition
i think i would not hold one in slavery
at any rate yet the point is not clear enough to me to denounce people upon
what next
free them
and make them politically and socially our equals
my own feelings will not admit of this and if mine would
we well know that those of the great mass of white people will not
whether this feeling accords with justice and sound judgment
is not the sole question
it is any part of it
a universal feeling
whether well or ill founded
cannot be safely disregarded
we cannot
make them equals
it does seem to me that systems of gradual emancipation might be adopted but for their tardiness in this i will not undertake to judge our brethren of the south
when they remind us of their constitutional rights
i acknowledge them
not grudgingly
but fully and fairly and i would give them any legislation for the reclaiming of their fugitives
which should not
in its stringency
be more likely to carry a free man into slavery than our ordinary criminal laws are to hang an innocent one
but all this
to my judgment
furnishes no more excuse for permitting slavery to go into our own free territory than it would for reviving the african slave trade by law
the law which forbids the bringing of slaves from africa
and that which has so long forbid the taking of them to nebraska
can hardly be distinguished on any moral principle and the repeal of the former could find quite as plausible excuses as that of the latter
i have reason to know that judge douglas knows that i said this
i think he has the answer here to one of the questions he put to me
i do not mean to allow him to catechize me unless he pays back for it in kind
i will not answer questions one after another
unless he reciprocates but as he has made this inquiry
and i have answered it before
he has got it without my getting anything in return
he has got my answer on the fugitive slave law
i don't want to read at any greater length but this is the true complexion of all i have ever said in regard to the institution of slavery and the black race
this is the whole of it and anything that argues me into his idea of perfect social and political equality with the negro is but a specious and fantastic arrangement of words
by which a man can prove a horse chestnut to be a chestnut horse
i will say here
while upon this subject
that i have no purpose
directly or indirectly
to interfere with the institution of slavery in the states where it exists
i believe i have no lawful right to do so
and i have no inclination to do so
i have no purpose to introduce political and social equality between the white and the black races
there is a physical difference between the two which
in my judgment
will probably forever forbid their living together upon the footing of perfect equality and inasmuch as it becomes a necessity that there must be a difference
as well as judge douglas
am in favor of the race to which i belong having the superior position
i have never said anything to the contrary
but i hold that
notwithstanding all this
there is no reason in the world why the negro is not entitled to all the natural rights enumerated in the declaration of independence
the right to life
and the pursuit of happiness
i hold that he is as much entitled to these as the white man
i agree with judge douglas he is not my equal in many respects
certainly not in color
perhaps not in moral or intellectual endowment
but in the right to eat the bread
without the leave of anybody else
which his own hand earns
he is my equal
and the equal of judge douglas
and the equal of every living man
now i pass on to consider one or two more of these little follies
the judge is woefully at fault about his early friend lincoln being a grocery keeper
i don't know as it would be a great sin
if i had been but he is mistaken
lincoln never kept a grocery anywhere in the world
it is true that lincoln did work the latter part of one winter in a little stillhouse
up at the head of a hollow
and so i think my friend the judge is equally at fault when he charges me at the time when i was in congress of having opposed our soldiers who were fighting in the mexican war
the judge did not make his charge very distinctly
but i can tell you what he can prove
by referring to the record
you remember i was an old whig
and whenever the democratic party tried to get me to vote that the war had been righteously begun by the president
i would not do it
but whenever they asked for any money
or landwarrants
or anything to pay the soldiers there
during all that time
i gave the same vote that judge douglas did
you can think as you please as to whether that was consistent
such is the truth
and the judge has the right to make all he can out of it
but when he
by a general charge
conveys the idea that i withheld supplies from the soldiers who were fighting in the mexican war
or did anything else to hinder the soldiers
he is
to say the least
grossly and altogether mistaken
as a consultation of the records will prove to him
as i have not used up so much of my time as i had supposed
i will dwell a little longer upon one or two of these minor topics upon which the judge has spoken
he has read from my speech in springfield
in which i say that a house divided against itself cannot stand does the judge say it can stand
i don't know whether he does or not
the judge does not seem to be attending to me just now
but i would like to know if it is his opinion that a house divided against itself can stand
if he does
then there is a question of veracity
not between him and me
but between the judge and an authority of a somewhat higher character
my friends
i ask your attention to this matter for the purpose of saying something seriously
i know that the judge may readily enough agree with me that the maxim which was put forth by the savior is true
but he may allege that i misapply it and the judge has a right to urge that
in my application
i do misapply it
and then i have a right to show that i do not misapply it
when he undertakes to say that because i think this nation
so far as the question of slavery is concerned
will all become one thing or all the other
i am in favor of bringing about a dead uniformity in the various states
in all their institutions
he argues erroneously
the great variety of the local institutions in the states
springing from differences in the soil
differences in the face of the country
and in the climate
are bonds of union
they do not make a house divided against itself
but they make a house united
if they produce in one section of the country what is called for
by the wants of another section
and this other section can supply the wants of the first
they are not matters of discord
but bonds of union
true bonds of union
but can this question of slavery be considered as among these varieties in the institutions of the country
i leave it to you to say whether
in the history of our government
this institution of slavery has not always failed to be a bond of union
on the contrary
been an apple of discord and an element of division in the house
i ask you to consider whether
so long as the moral constitution of men's minds shall continue to be the same
after this generation and assemblage shall sink into the grave
and another race shall arise
with the same moral and intellectual development we have
if that institution is standing in the same irritating position in which it now is
it will not continue an element of division
if so
then i have a right to say that
in regard to this question
the union is a house divided against itself and when the judge reminds me that i have often said to him that the institution of slavery has existed for eighty years in some states
and yet it does not exist in some others
i agree to the fact
and i account for it by looking at the position in which our fathers originally placed it restricting it from the new territories where it had not gone
and legislating to cut off its source by the abrogation of the slave trade
thus putting the seal of legislation against its spread
the public mind did rest in the belief that it was in the course of ultimate extinction
but lately
i think and in this i charge nothing on the judge's motives lately
i think that he
and those acting with him
have placed that institution on a new basis
which looks to the perpetuity and nationalization of slavery
and while it is placed upon this new basis
i say
and i have said
that i believe we shall not have peace upon the question until the opponents of slavery arrest the further spread of it
and place it where the public mind shall rest in the belief that it is in the course of ultimate extinction or
on the other hand
that its advocates will push it forward until it shall become alike lawful in all the states
old as well as new
north as well as south
i believe if we could arrest the spread
and place it where washington and jefferson and madison placed it
it would be in the course of ultimate extinction
and the public mind would
as for eighty years past
believe that it was in the course of ultimate extinction
the crisis would be past
and the institution might be let alone for a hundred years
if it should live so long
in the states where it exists yet it would be going out of existence in the way best for both the black and the white races
a voice
then do you repudiate popular sovereignty
well
let us talk about popular sovereignty
what is popular sovereignty
is it the right of the people to have slavery or not have it
as they see fit
in the territories
i will state and i have an able man to watch me my understanding is that popular sovereignty
as now applied to the question of slavery
does allow the people of a territory to have slavery if they want to
but does not allow them not to have it if they do not want it
i do not mean that if this vast concourse of people were in a territory of the united states
any one of them would be obliged to have a slave if he did not want one but i do say that
as i understand the dred scott decision
if any one man wants slaves
all the rest have no way of keeping that one man from holding them
when i made my speech at springfield
of which the judge complains
and from which he quotes
i really was not thinking of the things which he ascribes to me at all
i had no thought in the world that i was doing anything to bring about a war between the free and slave states
i had no thought in the world that i was doing anything to bring about a political and social equality of the black and white races
it never occurred to me that i was doing anything or favoring anything to reduce to a dead uniformity all the local institutions of the various states
but i must say
in all fairness to him
if he thinks i am doing something which leads to these bad results
it is none the better that i did not mean it
it is just as fatal to the country
if i have any influence in producing it
whether i intend it or not
but can it be true that placing this institution upon the original basis the basis upon which our fathers placed it can have any tendency to set the northern and the southern states at war with one another
or that it can have any tendency to make the people of vermont raise sugar cane
because they raise it in louisiana
or that it can compel the people of illinois to cut pine logs on the grand prairie
where they will not grow
because they cut pine logs in maine
where they do grow
the judge says this is a new principle started in regard to this question
does the judge claim that he is working on the plan of the founders of government
i think he says in some of his speeches indeed
i have one here now that he saw evidence of a policy to allow slavery to be south of a certain line
while north of it it should be excluded
and he saw an indisposition on the part of the country to stand upon that policy
and therefore he set about studying the subject upon original principles
and upon original principles he got up the nebraska bill
i am fighting it upon these original principles
fighting it in the jeffersonian
and madisonian fashion
my friends
i wish you to attend for a little while to one or two other things in that springfield speech
my main object was to show
so far as my humble ability was capable of showing
to the people of this country what i believed was the truth
that there was a tendency
if not a conspiracy
among those who have engineered this slavery question for the last four or five years
to make slavery perpetual and universal in this nation
having made that speech principally for that object
after arranging the evidences that i thought tended to prove my proposition
i concluded with this bit of comment
we cannot absolutely know that these exact adaptations are the result of preconcert but when we see a lot of framed timbers
different portions of which we know have been gotten out at different times and places
and by different workmen stephen
and james
for instance
and when we see these timbers joined together
and see they exactly make the frame of a house or a mill
all the tenons and mortises exactly fitting
and all the lengths and proportions of the different pieces exactly adapted to their respective places
and not a piece too many or too few
not omitting even the scaffolding
or if a single piece be lacking
we see the place in the frame exactly fitted and prepared yet to bring such piece in
in such a case we feel it impossible not to believe that stephen and franklin and roger and james all understood one another from the beginning
and all worked upon a common plan or draft drawn before the first blow was struck
when my friend judge douglas came to chicago on the 9th of july
this speech having been delivered on the 16th of june
he made an harangue there
in which he took hold of this speech of mine
showing that he had carefully read it and while he paid no attention to this matter at all
but complimented me as being a kind
and intelligent gentleman
notwithstanding i had said this
he goes on and eliminates
or draws out
from my speech this tendency of mine to set the states at war with one another
to make all the institutions uniform
and set the niggers and white people to marrying together
as the judge had complimented me with these pleasant titles i must confess to my weakness
i was a little taken
for it came from a great man
i was not very much accustomed to flattery
and it came the sweeter to me
i was rather like the hoosier
with the gingerbread
when he said he reckoned he loved it better than any other man
and got less of it
as the judge had so flattered me
i could not make up my mind that he meant to deal unfairly with me so i went to work to show him that he misunderstood the whole scope of my speech
and that i really never intended to set the people at war with one another
as an illustration
the next time i met him
which was at springfield
i used this expression
that i claimed no right under the constitution
nor had i any inclination
to enter into the slave states and interfere with the institutions of slavery
he says upon that
lincoln will not enter into the slave states
but will go to the banks of the ohio
on this side
and shoot over
he runs on
step by step
in the horse chestnut style of argument
until in the springfield speech he says
unless he shall be successful in firing his batteries until he shall have extinguished slavery in all the states the union shall be dissolved
now
i don't think that was exactly the way to treat a kind
intelligent gentleman
i know if i had asked the judge to show when or where it was i had said that
if i didn't succeed in firing into the slave states until slavery should be extinguished
the union should be dissolved
he could not have shown it
i understand what he would do
he would say
i don't mean to quote from you
but this was the result of what you say
but i have the right to ask
and i do ask now
did you not put it in such a form that an ordinary reader or listener would take it as an expression from me
in a speech at springfield
on the night of the 17th
i thought i might as well attend to my own business a little
and i recalled his attention as well as i could to this charge of conspiracy to nationalize slavery
i called his attention to the fact that he had acknowledged in my hearing twice that he had carefully read the speech
in the language of the lawyers
as he had twice read the speech
and still had put in no plea or answer
i took a default on him
i insisted that i had a right then to renew that charge of conspiracy
ten days afterward i met the judge at clinton
that is to say
i was on the ground
but not in the discussion
and heard him make a speech
then he comes in with his plea to this charge
for the first time and his plea when put in
as well as i can recollect it
amounted to this
that he never had any talk with judge taney or the president of the united states with regard to the dred scott decision before it was made
i lincoln ought to know that the man who makes a charge without knowing it to be true falsifies as much as he who knowingly tells a falsehood and
that he would pronounce the whole thing a falsehood but
he would make no personal application of the charge of falsehood
not because of any regard for the kind
intelligent gentleman
but because of his own personal self respect
i have understood since then but turning to judge douglas will not hold the judge to it if he is not willing that he has broken through the self respect
and has got to saying the thing out
the judge nods to me that it is so
it is fortunate for me that i can keep as good humored as i do
when the judge acknowledges that he has been trying to make a question of veracity with me
i know the judge is a great man
while i am only a small man
but i feel that i have got him
i demur to that plea
i waive all objections that it was not filed till after default was taken
and demur to it upon the merits
what if judge douglas never did talk with chief justice taney and the president before the dred scott decision was made
does it follow that he could not have had as perfect an understanding without talking as with it
i am not disposed to stand upon my legal advantage
i am disposed to take his denial as being like an answer in chancery
that he neither had any knowledge
or belief in the existence of such a conspiracy
i am disposed to take his answer as being as broad as though he had put it in these words
and now
i ask
even if he had done so
have not i a right to prove it on him
and to offer the evidence of more than two witnesses
by whom to prove it and if the evidence proves the existence of the conspiracy
does his broader answer denying all knowledge
or belief
disturb the fact
it can only show that he was used by conspirators
and was not a leader of them
in regard to his reminding me of the moral rule that persons who tell what they do not know to be true falsify as much as those who knowingly tell falsehoods
i remember the rule
and it must be borne in mind that in what i have read to you
i do not say that i know such a conspiracy to exist
to that i reply
i believe it
if the judge says that i do not believe it
then he says what he does not know
and falls within his own rule
that he who asserts a thing which he does not know to be true
falsifies as much as he who knowingly tells a falsehood
i want to call your attention to a little discussion on that branch of the case
and the evidence which brought my mind to the conclusion which i expressed as my belief
in arraying that evidence i had stated anything which was false or erroneous
it needed but that judge douglas should point it out
and i would have taken it back
with all the kindness in the world
i do not deal in that way
if i have brought forward anything not a fact
if he will point it out
it will not even ruffle me to take it back
but if he will not point out anything erroneous in the evidence
is it not rather for him to show
by a comparison of the evidence
that i have reasoned falsely
than to call the kind
intelligent gentleman a liar
if i have reasoned to a false conclusion
it is the vocation of an able debater to show by argument that i have wandered to an erroneous conclusion
i want to ask your attention to a portion of the nebraska bill
which judge douglas has quoted
it being the true intent and meaning of this act
not to legislate slavery into any territory or state
nor to exclude it therefrom
but to leave the people thereof perfectly free to form and regulate their domestic institutions in their own way
subject only to the constitution of the united states
thereupon judge douglas and others began to argue in favor of popular sovereignty
the right of the people to have slaves if they wanted them
and to exclude slavery if they did not want them
said
in substance
a senator from ohio mr
i believe
we more than suspect that you do not mean to allow the people to exclude slavery if they wish to and if you do mean it
accept an amendment which i propose
expressly authorizing the people to exclude slavery
i believe i have the amendment here before me
which was offered
and under which the people of the territory
through their representatives
if they saw fit
prohibit the existence of slavery therein
and now i state it as a fact
to be taken back if there is any mistake about it
that judge douglas and those acting with him voted that amendment down
i now think that those men who voted it down had a real reason for doing so
they know what that reason was
it looks to us
since we have seen the dred scott decision pronounced
holding that under the constitution the people cannot exclude slavery
i say it looks to outsiders
intelligent gentlemen
as though the niche was left as a place to put that dred scott decision in
a niche which would have been spoiled by adopting the amendment
and now
i say again
if this was not the reason
it will avail the judge much more to calmly and good humoredly point out to these people what that other reason was for voting the amendment down
swelling himself up
to vociferate that he may be provoked to call somebody a liar
there is in that same quotation from the nebraska bill this clause
it being the true intent and meaning of this bill not to legislate slavery into any territory or state
i have always been puzzled to know what business the word state had in that connection
judge douglas knows
he put it there
he knows what he put it there for
we outsiders cannot say what he put it there for
the law they were passing was not about states
and was not making provisions for states
what was it placed there for
after seeing the dred scott decision
which holds that the people cannot exclude slavery from a territory
if another dred scott decision shall come
holding that they cannot exclude it from a state
we shall discover that when the word was originally put there
it was in view of something which was to come in due time
we shall see that it was the other half of something
i now say again
if there is any different reason for putting it there
judge douglas
in a good humored way
without calling anybody a liar
can tell what the reason was
when the judge spoke at clinton
he came very near making a charge of falsehood against me
he used
as i found it printed in a newspaper
i remember
was very nearly like the real speech
the following language
i did not answer the charge of conspiracy before
for the reason that i did not suppose there was a man in america with a heart so corrupt as to believe such a charge could be true
i have too much respect for mr
lincoln to suppose he is serious in making the charge
i confess this is rather a curious view
that out of respect for me he should consider i was making what i deemed rather a grave charge in fun
i confess it strikes me rather strangely
but i let it pass
as the judge did not for a moment believe that there was a man in america whose heart was so corrupt as to make such a charge
and as he places me among the men in america who have hearts base enough to make such a charge
i hope he will excuse me if i hunt out another charge very like this and if it should turn out that in hunting i should find that other
and it should turn out to be judge douglas himself who made it
i hope he will reconsider this question of the deep corruption of heart he has thought fit to ascribe to me
in judge douglas's speech of march 22
which i hold in my hand
he says
in this connection there is another topic to which i desire to allude
i seldom refer to the course of newspapers
or notice the articles which they publish in regard to myself but the course of the washington union has been so extraordinary for the last two or three months
that i think it well enough to make some allusion to it
it has read me out of the democratic party every other day
at least for two or three months
and keeps reading me out
as if it had not succeeded
still continues to read me out
using such terms as 'traitor
 'renegade
 'deserter
 and other kind and polite epithets of that nature
i have no vindication to make of my democracy against the washington union
or any other newspapers
i am willing to allow my history and action for the last twenty years to speak for themselves as to my political principles and my fidelity to political obligations
the washington union has a personal grievance
when its editor was nominated for public printer
i declined to vote for him
and stated that at some time i might give my reasons for doing so
since i declined to give that vote
this scurrilous abuse
these vindictive and constant attacks have been repeated almost daily on me
will any friend from michigan read the article to which i allude
this is a part of the speech
you must excuse me from reading the entire article of the washington union
as mr
stuart read it for mr
the judge goes on and sums up
as i think
you here find several distinct propositions advanced boldly by the washington union editorially
and apparently authoritatively and any man who questions any of them is denounced as an abolitionist
a free soiler
a fanatic
the propositions are
that the primary object of all government at its original institution is the protection of person and property second
that the constitution of the united states declares that the citizens of each state shall be entitled to all the privileges and immunities of citizens in the several states and that
all state laws
whether organic or otherwise
which prohibit the citizens of one state from settling in another with their slave property
and especially declaring it forfeited
are direct violations of the original intention of the government and constitution of the united states and
that the emancipation of the slaves of the northern states was a gross outrage of the rights of property
inasmuch as it was involuntarily done on the part of the owner
remember that this article was published in the union on the 17th of november
and on the 18th appeared the first article giving the adhesion of the union
to the lecompton constitution
it was in these words
kansas and her constitution
the vexed question is settled
the problem is saved
the dead point of danger is passed
all serious trouble to kansas affairs is over and gone
and a column nearly of the same sort
when you come to look into the lecompton constitution
you find the same doctrine incorporated in it which was put forth editorially in the union
what is it
article 7
section i
the right of property is before and higher than any constitutional sanction and the right of the owner of a slave to such slave and its increase is the same and as inviolable as the right of the owner of any property whatever
then in the schedule is a provision that the constitution may be amended after 1864 by a two thirds vote
but no alteration shall be made to affect the right of property in the ownership of slaves
it will be seen by these clauses in the lecompton constitution that they are identical in spirit with the authoritative article in the washington union of the day previous to its indorsement of this constitution
i pass over some portions of the speech
and i hope that any one who feels interested in this matter will read the entire section of the speech
and see whether i do the judge injustice
he proceeds
when i saw that article in the union of the 17th of november
followed by the glorification of the lecompton constitution on the 10th of november
and this clause in the constitution asserting the doctrine that a state has no right to prohibit slavery within its limits
i saw that there was a fatal blow being struck at the sovereignty of the states of this union
i stop the quotation there
again requesting that it may all be read
i have read all of the portion i desire to comment upon
what is this charge that the judge thinks i must have a very corrupt heart to make
it was a purpose on the part of certain high functionaries to make it impossible for the people of one state to prohibit the people of any other state from entering it with their property
so called
and making it a slave state
in other words
it was a charge implying a design to make the institution of slavery national
and now i ask your attention to what judge douglas has himself done here
i know he made that part of the speech as a reason why he had refused to vote for a certain man for public printer but when we get at it
the charge itself is the very one i made against him
that he thinks i am so corrupt for uttering
whom does he make that charge against
does he make it against that newspaper editor merely
no he says it is identical in spirit with the lecompton constitution
and so the framers of that constitution are brought in with the editor of the newspaper in that fatal blow being struck
he did not call it a conspiracy
in his language
it is a fatal blow being struck
and if the words carry the meaning better when changed from a conspiracy into a fatal blow being struck
i will change my expression
and call it fatal blow being struck
we see the charge made not merely against the editor of the union
but all the framers of the lecompton constitution and not only so
but the article was an authoritative article
by whose authority
is there any question but he means it was by the authority of the president and his cabinet
the administration
is there any sort of question but he means to make that charge
then there are the editors of the union
the framers of the lecompton constitution
the president of the united states and his cabinet
and all the supporters of the lecompton constitution
in congress and out of congress
who are all involved in this fatal blow being struck
i commend to judge douglas's consideration the question of how corrupt a man's heart must be to make such a charge
my friends
i have but one branch of the subject
in the little time i have left
to which to call your attention and as i shall come to a close at the end of that branch
it is probable that i shall not occupy quite all the time allotted to me
although on these questions i would like to talk twice as long as i have
i could not enter upon another head and discuss it properly without running over my time
i ask the attention of the people here assembled and elsewhere to the course that judge douglas is pursuing every day as bearing upon this question of making slavery national
not going back to the records
but taking the speeches he makes
the speeches he made yesterday and day before
and makes constantly all over the country
i ask your attention to them
in the first place
what is necessary to make the institution national
not war
there is no danger that the people of kentucky will shoulder their muskets
with a young nigger stuck on every bayonet
march into illinois and force them upon us
there is no danger of our going over there and making war upon them
then what is necessary for the nationalization of slavery
it is simply the next dred scott decision
it is merely for the supreme court to decide that no state under the constitution can exclude it
just as they have already decided that under the constitution neither congress nor the territorial legislature can do it
when that is decided and acquiesced in
the whole thing is done
this being true
and this being the way
as i think
that slavery is to be made national
let us consider what judge douglas is doing every day to that end
in the first place
let us see what influence he is exerting on public sentiment
in this and like communities
public sentiment is everything
with public sentiment
nothing can fail without it
nothing can succeed
he who moulds public sentiment goes deeper than he who enacts statutes or pronounces decisions
he makes statutes and decisions possible or impossible to be executed
this must be borne in mind
as also the additional fact that judge douglas is a man of vast influence
so great that it is enough for many men to profess to believe anything when they once find out judge douglas professes to believe it
consider also the attitude he occupies at the head of a large party
a party which he claims has a majority of all the voters in the country
this man sticks to a decision which forbids the people of a territory from excluding slavery
and he does so
not because he says it is right in itself
he does not give any opinion on that
but because it has been decided by the court and being decided by the court
he is
and you are
bound to take it in your political action as law
not that he judges at all of its merits
but because a decision of the court is to him a thus saith the lord
he places it on that ground alone and you will bear in mind that thus committing himself unreservedly to this decision commits him to the next one just as firmly as to this
he did not commit himself on account of the merit or demerit of the decision
but it is a thus saith the lord
the next decision
as much as this
will be a thus saith the lord
there is nothing that can divert or turn him away from this decision
it is nothing that i point out to him that his great prototype
general jackson
did not believe in the binding force of decisions
it is nothing to him that jefferson did not so believe
i have said that i have often heard him approve of jackson's course in disregarding the decision of the supreme court pronouncing a national bank constitutional
he says i did not hear him say so
he denies the accuracy of my recollection
i say he ought to know better than i
but i will make no question about this thing
though it still seems to me that i heard him say it twenty times
i will tell him
that he now claims to stand on the cincinnati platform
which affirms that congress cannot charter a national bank
in the teeth of that old standing decision that congress can charter a bank
and i remind him of another piece of history on the question of respect for judicial decisions
and it is a piece of illinois history belonging to a time when the large party to which judge douglas belonged were displeased with a decision of the supreme court of illinois
because they had decided that a governor could not remove a secretary of state
you will find the whole story in ford's history of illinois
and i know that judge douglas will not deny that he was then in favor of over slaughing that decision by the mode of adding five new judges
so as to vote down the four old ones
not only so
but it ended in the judge's sitting down on that very bench as one of the five new judges to break down the four old ones it was in this way precisely that he got his title of judge
when the judge tells me that men appointed conditionally to sit as members of a court will have to be catechized beforehand upon some subject
i say
you know
judge you have tried it
when he says a court of this kind will lose the confidence of all men
will be prostituted and disgraced by such a proceeding
i say
you know best
judge you have been through the mill
but i cannot shake judge douglas's teeth loose from the dred scott decision
like some obstinate animal i mean no disrespect that will hang on when he has once got his teeth fixed
you may cut off a leg
or you may tear away an arm
still he will not relax his hold
and so i may point out to the judge
and say that he is bespattered all over
from the beginning of his political life to the present time
with attacks upon judicial decisions i may cut off limb after limb of his public record
and strive to wrench him from a single dictum of the court
yet i cannot divert him from it
he hangs
to the last
to the dred scott decision
these things show there is a purpose strong as death and eternity for which he adheres to this decision
and for which he will adhere to all other decisions of the same court
a hibernian
give us something besides dred scott
yes no doubt you want to hear something that don't hurt
having spoken of the dred scott decision
one more word
and i am done
henry clay
my beau ideal of a statesman
the man for whom i fought all my humble life
henry clay once said of a class of men who would repress all tendencies to liberty and ultimate emancipation that they must
if they would do this
go back to the era of our independence
and muzzle the cannon which thunders its annual joyous return they must blow out the moral lights around us they must penetrate the human soul
and eradicate there the love of liberty and then
and not till then
could they perpetuate slavery in this country
to my thinking
judge douglas is
by his example and vast influence
doing that very thing in this community
when he says that the negro has nothing in the declaration of independence
henry clay plainly understood the contrary
judge douglas is going back to the era of our revolution
to the extent of his ability
muzzling the cannon which thunders its annual joyous return
when he invites any people
willing to have slavery
to establish it
he is blowing out the moral lights around us
when he says he cares not whether slavery is voted down or up
that it is a sacred right of self government
he is
in my judgment
penetrating the human soul and eradicating the light of reason and the love of liberty in this american people
and now i will only say that when
by all these means and appliances
judge douglas shall succeed in bringing public sentiment to an exact accordance with his own views when these vast assemblages shall echo back all these sentiments when they shall come to repeat his views and to avow his principles
and to say all that he says on these mighty questions
then it needs only the formality of the second dred scott decision
which he indorses in advance
to make slavery alike lawful in all the states
old as well as new
north as well as south
my friends
that ends the chapter
the judge can take his half hour
second joint debate
at freeport
august 27
1858 ladies and gentlemen
on saturday last
judge douglas and myself first met in public discussion
he spoke one hour
i an hour and a half
and he replied for half an hour
the order is now reversed
i am to speak an hour
he an hour and a half
and then i am to reply for half an hour
i propose to devote myself during the first hour to the scope of what was brought within the range of his half hour speech at ottawa
of course there was brought within the scope in that half hour's speech something of his own opening speech
in the course of that opening argument judge douglas proposed to me seven distinct interrogatories
in my speech of an hour and a half
i attended to some other parts of his speech
and incidentally
as i thought
intimated to him that i would answer the rest of his interrogatories on condition only that he should agree to answer as many for me
he made no intimation at the time of the proposition
nor did he in his reply allude at all to that suggestion of mine
i do him no injustice in saying that he occupied at least half of his reply in dealing with me as though i had refused to answer his interrogatories
i now propose that i will answer any of the interrogatories
upon condition that he will answer questions from me not exceeding the same number
i give him an opportunity to respond
the judge remains silent
i now say that i will answer his interrogatories
whether he answers mine or not and that after i have done so
i shall propound mine to him
i have supposed myself
since the organization of the republican party at bloomington
in may
bound as a party man by the platforms of the party
then and since
if in any interrogatories which i shall answer i go beyond the scope of what is within these platforms
it will be perceived that no one is responsible but myself
having said thus much
i will take up the judge's interrogatories as i find them printed in the chicago times
and answer them seriatim
in order that there may be no mistake about it
i have copied the interrogatories in writing
and also my answers to them
the first one of these interrogatories is in these words
question 1
i desire to know whether lincoln to day stands
as he did in 1854
in favor of the unconditional repeal of the fugitive slave law
answer
i do not now
nor ever did
stand in favor of the unconditional repeal of the fugitive slave law
i desire him to answer whether he stands pledged to day
as he did in 1854
against the admission of any more slave states into the union
even if the people want them
answer
i do not now
nor ever did
stand pledged against the admission of any more slave states into the union
i want to know whether he stands pledged against the admission of a new state into the union with such a constitution as the people of that state may see fit to make
answer
i do not stand pledged against the admission of a new state into the union
with such a constitution as the people of that state may see fit to make
i want to know whether he stands to day pledged to the abolition of slavery in the district of columbia
answer
i do not stand to day pledged to the abolition of slavery in the district of columbia
i desire him to answer whether he stands pledged to the prohibition of the slave trade between the different states
answer
i do not stand pledged to the prohibition of the slave trade between the different states
i desire to know whether he stands pledged to prohibit slavery in all the territories of the united states
north as well as south of the missouri compromise line
answer
i am impliedly
if not expressly
pledged to a belief in the right and duty of congress to prohibit slavery in all the united states 'territories
i desire him to answer whether he is opposed to the acquisition of any new territory unless slavery is first prohibited therein
answer
i am not generally opposed to honest acquisition of territory and
in any given case
i would or would not oppose such acquisition
accordingly as i might think such acquisition would or would not aggravate the slavery question among ourselves
my friends
it will be perceived
upon an examination of these questions and answers
that so far i have only answered that i was not pledged to this
or the other
the judge has not framed his interrogatories to ask me anything more than this
and i have answered in strict accordance with the interrogatories
and have answered truly
that i am not pledged at all upon any of the points to which i have answered
but i am not disposed to hang upon the exact form of his interrogatory
i am rather disposed to take up at least some of these questions
and state what i really think upon them
as to the first one
in regard to the fugitive slave law
i have never hesitated to say
and i do not now hesitate to say
that i think
under the constitution of the united states
the people of the southern states are entitled to a congressional fugitive slave law
having said that
i have had nothing to say in regard to the existing fugitive slave law
further than that i think it should have been framed so as to be free from some of the objections that pertain to it
without lessening its efficiency
and inasmuch as we are not now in an agitation in regard to an alteration or modification of that law
i would not be the man to introduce it as a new subject of agitation upon the general question of slavery
in regard to the other question
of whether i am pledged to the admission of any more slave states into the union
i state to you very frankly that i would be exceedingly sorry ever to be put in a position of having to pass upon that question
i should be exceedingly glad to know that there would never be another slave state admitted into the union but i must add that if slavery shall be kept out of the territories during the territorial existence of any one given territory
and then the people shall
having a fair chance and a clear field
when they come to adopt the constitution
do such an extraordinary thing as to adopt a slave constitution
uninfluenced by the actual presence of the institution among them
i see no alternative
if we own the country
but to admit them into the union
the third interrogatory is answered by the answer to the second
it being
as i conceive
the same as the second
the fourth one is in regard to the abolition of slavery in the district of columbia
in relation to that
i have my mind very distinctly made up
i should be exceedingly glad to see slavery abolished in the district of columbia
i believe that congress possesses the constitutional power to abolish it
yet as a member of congress
i should not
with my present views
be in favor of endeavoring to abolish slavery in the district of columbia
unless it would be upon these conditions
that the abolition should be gradual second
that it should be on a vote of the majority of qualified voters in the district and third
that compensation should be made to unwilling owners
with these three conditions
i confess i would be exceedingly glad to see congress abolish slavery in the district of columbia
in the language of henry clay
sweep from our capital that foul blot upon our nation
in regard to the fifth interrogatory
i must say here that
as to the question of the abolition of the slave trade between the different states
i can truly answer
as i have
that i am pledged to nothing about it
it is a subject to which i have not given that mature consideration that would make me feel authorized to state a position so as to hold myself entirely bound by it
in other words
that question has never been prominently enough before me to induce me to investigate whether we really have the constitutional power to do it
i could investigate it if i had sufficient time to bring myself to a conclusion upon that subject but i have not done so
and i say so frankly to you here
and to judge douglas
i must say
that if i should be of opinion that congress does possess the constitutional power to abolish the slave trade among the different states
i should still not be in favor of the exercise of that power
unless upon some conservative principle as i conceive it
akin to what i have said in relation to the abolition of slavery in the district of columbia
my answer as to whether i desire that slavery should be prohibited in all the territories of the united states is full and explicit within itself
and cannot be made clearer by any comments of mine
so i suppose in regard to the question whether i am opposed to the acquisition of any more territory unless slavery is first prohibited therein
my answer is such that i could add nothing by way of illustration
or making myself better understood
than the answer which i have placed in writing
now in all this the judge has me
and he has me on the record
i suppose he had flattered himself that i was really entertaining one set of opinions for one place
and another set for another place that i was afraid to say at one place what i uttered at another
what i am saying here i suppose i say to a vast audience as strongly tending to abolitionism as any audience in the state of illinois
and i believe i am saying that which
if it would be offensive to any persons and render them enemies to myself
would be offensive to persons in this audience
i now proceed to propound to the judge the interrogatories
so far as i have framed them
i will bring forward a new installment when i get them ready
i will bring them forward now only reaching to number four
the first one is
question 1
if the people of kansas shall
by means entirely unobjectionable in all other respects
adopt a state constitution
and ask admission into the union under it
before they have the requisite number of inhabitants according to the english bill
some ninety three thousand
will you vote to admit them
can the people of a united states territory
in any lawful way
against the wish of any citizen of the united states
exclude slavery from its limits prior to the formation of a state constitution
if the supreme court of the united states shall decide that states cannot exclude slavery from their limits
are you in favor of acquiescing in
and following such decision as a rule of political action
are you in favor of acquiring additional territory
in disregard of how such acquisition may affect the nation on the slavery question
as introductory to these interrogatories which judge douglas propounded to me at ottawa
he read a set of resolutions which he said judge trumbull and myself had participated in adopting
in the first republican state convention
held at springfield in october
he insisted that i and judge trumbull
and perhaps the entire republican party
were responsible for the doctrines contained in the set of resolutions which he read
and i understand that it was from that set of resolutions that he deduced the interrogatories which he propounded to me
using these resolutions as a sort of authority for propounding those questions to me
i say here to day that i do not answer his interrogatories because of their springing at all from that set of resolutions which he read
i answered them because judge douglas thought fit to ask them
i do not now
nor ever did
recognize any responsibility upon myself in that set of resolutions
when i replied to him on that occasion
i assured him that i never had anything to do with them
i repeat here to today that i never in any possible form had anything to do with that set of resolutions it turns out
i believe
that those resolutions were never passed in any convention held in springfield
it turns out that they were never passed at any convention or any public meeting that i had any part in
i believe it turns out
in addition to all this
that there was not
in the fall of 1854
any convention holding a session in springfield
calling itself a republican state convention yet it is true there was a convention
or assemblage of men calling themselves a convention
at springfield
that did pass some resolutions
but so little did i really know of the proceedings of that convention
or what set of resolutions they had passed
though having a general knowledge that there had been such an assemblage of men there
that when judge douglas read the resolutions
i really did not know but they had been the resolutions passed then and there
i did not question that they were the resolutions adopted
for i could not bring myself to suppose that judge douglas could say what he did upon this subject without knowing that it was true
i contented myself
on that occasion
with denying
as i truly could
all connection with them
not denying or affirming whether they were passed at springfield
it turns out that he had got hold of some resolutions passed at some convention or public meeting in kane county
i wish to say here
that i don't conceive that in any fair and just mind this discovery relieves me at all
i had just as much to do with the convention in kane county as that at springfield
i am as much responsible for the resolutions at kane county as those at springfield
the amount of the responsibility being exactly nothing in either case no more than there would be in regard to a set of resolutions passed in the moon
i allude to this extraordinary matter in this canvass for some further purpose than anything yet advanced
judge douglas did not make his statement upon that occasion as matters that he believed to be true
but he stated them roundly as being true
in such form as to pledge his veracity for their truth
when the whole matter turns out as it does
and when we consider who judge douglas is
that he is a distinguished senator of the united states that he has served nearly twelve years as such that his character is not at all limited as an ordinary senator of the united states
but that his name has become of world wide renown
it is most extraordinary that he should so far forget all the suggestions of justice to an adversary
or of prudence to himself
as to venture upon the assertion of that which the slightest investigation would have shown him to be wholly false
i can only account for his having done so upon the supposition that that evil genius which has attended him through his life
giving to him an apparent astonishing prosperity
such as to lead very many good men to doubt there being any advantage in virtue over vice
i say i can only account for it on the supposition that that evil genius has as last made up its mind to forsake him
and i may add that another extraordinary feature of the judge's conduct in this canvass made more extraordinary by this incident is
that he is in the habit
in almost all the speeches he makes
of charging falsehood upon his adversaries
myself and others
i now ask whether he is able to find in anything that judge trumbull
for instance
has said
or in anything that i have said
a justification at all compared with what we have
in this instance
for that sort of vulgarity
i have been in the habit of charging as a matter of belief on my part that
in the introduction of the nebraska bill into congress
there was a conspiracy to make slavery perpetual and national
i have arranged from time to time the evidence which establishes and proves the truth of this charge
i recurred to this charge at ottawa
i shall not now have time to dwell upon it at very great length but inasmuch as judge douglas
in his reply of half an hour
made some points upon me in relation to it
i propose noticing a few of them
the judge insists that
in the first speech i made
in which i very distinctly made that charge
he thought for a good while i was in fun
that i was playful that i was not sincere about it and that he only grew angry and somewhat excited when he found that i insisted upon it as a matter of earnestness
he says he characterized it as a falsehood so far as i implicated his moral character in that transaction
i did not know
till he presented that view
that i had implicated his moral character
he is very much in the habit
when he argues me up into a position i never thought of occupying
of very cosily saying he has no doubt lincoln is conscientious in saying so
he should remember that i did not know but what he was altogether conscientious in that matter
i can conceive it possible for men to conspire to do a good thing
and i really find nothing in judge douglas's course of arguments that is contrary to or inconsistent with his belief of a conspiracy to nationalize and spread slavery as being a good and blessed thing and so i hope he will understand that i do not at all question but that in all this matter he is entirely conscientious
but to draw your attention to one of the points i made in this case
beginning at the beginning
when the nebraska bill was introduced
or a short time afterward
by an amendment
i believe
it was provided that it must be considered the true intent and meaning of this act not to legislate slavery into any state or territory
or to exclude it therefrom
but to leave the people thereof perfectly free to form and regulate their own domestic institutions in their own way
subject only to the constitution of the united states
i have called his attention to the fact that when he and some others began arguing that they were giving an increased degree of liberty to the people in the territories over and above what they formerly had on the question of slavery
a question was raised whether the law was enacted to give such unconditional liberty to the people and to test the sincerity of this mode of argument
of ohio
introduced an amendment
in which he made the law if the amendment were adopted expressly declare that the people of the territory should have the power to exclude slavery if they saw fit
i have asked attention also to the fact that judge douglas and those who acted with him voted that amendment down
notwithstanding it expressed exactly the thing they said was the true intent and meaning of the law
i have called attention to the fact that in subsequent times a decision of the supreme court has been made
in which it has been declared that a territorial legislature has no constitutional right to exclude slavery
and i have argued and said that for men who did
intend that the people of the territory should have the right to exclude slavery absolutely and unconditionally
the voting down of chase's amendment is wholly inexplicable
it is a puzzle
a riddle
but i have said
that with men who did look forward to such a decision
or who had it in contemplation that such a decision of the supreme court would or might be made
the voting down of that amendment would be perfectly rational and intelligible
it would keep congress from coming in collision with the decision when it was made
anybody can conceive that if there was an intention or expectation that such a decision was to follow
it would not be a very desirable party attitude to get into for the supreme court all or nearly all its members belonging to the same party to decide one way
when the party in congress had decided the other way
hence it would be very rational for men expecting such a decision to keep the niche in that law clear for it
after pointing this out
i tell judge douglas that it looks to me as though here was the reason why chase's amendment was voted down
i tell him that
as he did it
and knows why he did it
if it was done for a reason different from this
he knows what that reason was and can tell us what it was
i tell him
it will be vastly more satisfactory to the country for him to give some other plausible
intelligible reason why it was voted down than to stand upon his dignity and call people liars
on saturday he did make his answer and what do you think it was
he says if i had only taken upon myself to tell the whole truth about that amendment of chase's
no explanation would have been necessary on his part or words to that effect
i say here that i am quite unconscious of having suppressed anything material to the case
and i am very frank to admit if there is any sound reason other than that which appeared to me material
it is quite fair for him to present it
what reason does he propose
that when chase came forward with his amendment expressly authorizing the people to exclude slavery from the limits of every territory
general cass proposed to chase
if he chase would add to his amendment that the people should have the power to introduce or exclude
they would let it go
this is substantially all of his reply
and because chase would not do that
they voted his amendment down
it turns out
i believe
upon examination
that general cass took some part in the little running debate upon that amendment
and then ran away and did not vote on it at all
is not that the fact
so confident
as i think
was general cass that there was a snake somewhere about
he chose to run away from the whole thing
this is an inference i draw from the fact that
though he took part in the debate
his name does not appear in the ayes and noes
but does judge douglas's reply amount to a satisfactory answer
cries of yes
yes
and no
no
there is some little difference of opinion here
but i ask attention to a few more views bearing on the question of whether it amounts to a satisfactory answer
the men who were determined that that amendment should not get into the bill
and spoil the place where the dred scott decision was to come in
sought an excuse to get rid of it somewhere
one of these ways one of these excuses was to ask chase to add to his proposed amendment a provision that the people might introduce slavery if they wanted to
they very well knew chase would do no such thing
that mr
chase was one of the men differing from them on the broad principle of his insisting that freedom was better than slavery
a man who would not consent to enact a law
penned with his own hand
by which he was made to recognize slavery on the one hand
and liberty on the other
as precisely equal and when they insisted on his doing this
they very well knew they insisted on that which he would not for a moment think of doing
and that they were only bluffing him
i believe i have not
since he made his answer
had a chance to examine the journals or congressional globe and therefore speak from memory i believe the state of the bill at that time
according to parliamentary rules
was such that no member could propose an additional amendment to chase's amendment
i rather think this is the truth
the judge shakes his head
very well
i would like to know
if they wanted chase's amendment fixed over
why somebody else could not have offered to do it
if they wanted it amended
why did they not offer the amendment
why did they not put it in themselves
but to put it on the other ground
suppose that there was such an amendment offered
and chase's was an amendment to an amendment until one is disposed of by parliamentary law
you cannot pile another on
then all these gentlemen had to do was to vote chase's on
and then
in the amended form in which the whole stood
add their own amendment to it
if they wanted to put it in that shape
this was all they were obliged to do
and the ayes and noes show that there were thirty six who voted it down
against ten who voted in favor of it
the thirty six held entire sway and control
they could in some form or other have put that bill in the exact shape they wanted
if there was a rule preventing their amending it at the time
they could pass that
and then
chase's amendment being merged
put it in the shape they wanted
they did not choose to do so
but they went into a quibble with chase to get him to add what they knew he would not add
and because he would not
they stand upon the flimsy pretext for voting down what they argued was the meaning and intent of their own bill
they left room thereby for this dred scott decision
which goes very far to make slavery national throughout the united states
i pass one or two points i have
because my time will very soon expire but i must be allowed to say that judge douglas recurs again
as he did upon one or two other occasions
to the enormity of lincoln
an insignificant individual like lincoln
upon his ipse dixit charging a conspiracy upon a large number of members of congress
the supreme court
and two presidents
to nationalize slavery
i want to say that
in the first place
i have made no charge of this sort upon my ipse dixit
i have only arrayed the evidence tending to prove it
and presented it to the understanding of others
saying what i think it proves
but giving you the means of judging whether it proves it or not
this is precisely what i have done
i have not placed it upon my ipse dixit at all
on this occasion
i wish to recall his attention to a piece of evidence which i brought forward at ottawa on saturday
showing that he had made substantially the same charge against substantially the same persons
excluding his dear self from the category
i ask him to give some attention to the evidence which i brought forward that he himself had discovered a fatal blow being struck against the right of the people to exclude slavery from their limits
which fatal blow he assumed as in evidence in an article in the washington union
published by authority
i ask by whose authority
he discovers a similar or identical provision in the lecompton constitution
made by whom
the framers of that constitution
advocated by whom
by all the members of the party in the nation
who advocated the introduction of kansas into the union under the lecompton constitution
i have asked his attention to the evidence that he arrayed to prove that such a fatal blow was being struck
and to the facts which he brought forward in support of that charge
being identical with the one which he thinks so villainous in me
he pointed it
not at a newspaper editor merely
but at the president and his cabinet and the members of congress advocating the lecompton constitution and those framing that instrument
i must again be permitted to remind him that although my ipse dixit may not be as great as his
yet it somewhat reduces the force of his calling my attention to the enormity of my making a like charge against him
go on
judge douglas
lincoln's rejoinder
my friends
it will readily occur to you that i cannot
in half an hour
notice all the things that so able a man as judge douglas can say in an hour and a half and i hope
if there be anything that he has said upon which you would like to hear something from me
but which i omit to comment upon
you will bear in mind that it would be expecting an impossibility for me to go over his whole ground
i can but take up some of the points that he has dwelt upon
and employ my half hour specially on them
the first thing i have to say to you is a word in regard to judge douglas's declaration about the vulgarity and blackguardism in the audience
that no such thing
as he says
was shown by any democrat while i was speaking
i only wish
by way of reply on this subject
to say that while i was speaking
i used no vulgarity or blackguardism toward any democrat
my friends
i come to all this long portion of the judge's speech
perhaps half of it
which he has devoted to the various resolutions and platforms that have been adopted in the different counties in the different congressional districts
and in the illinois legislature
which he supposes are at variance with the positions i have assumed before you to day
it is true that many of these resolutions are at variance with the positions i have here assumed
all i have to ask is that we talk reasonably and rationally about it
i happen to know
the judge's opinion to the contrary notwithstanding
that i have never tried to conceal my opinions
nor tried to deceive any one in reference to them
he may go and examine all the members who voted for me for united states senator in 1855
after the election of 1854
they were pledged to certain things here at home
and were determined to have pledges from me and if he will find any of these persons who will tell him anything inconsistent with what i say now
i will resign
or rather retire from the race
and give him no more trouble
the plain truth is this
at the introduction of the nebraska policy
we believed there was a new era being introduced in the history of the republic
which tended to the spread and perpetuation of slavery
but in our opposition to that measure we did not agree with one another in everything
the people in the north end of the state were for stronger measures of opposition than we of the central and southern portions of the state
but we were all opposed to the nebraska doctrine
we had that one feeling and that one sentiment in common
you at the north end met in your conventions and passed your resolutions
we in the middle of the state and farther south did not hold such conventions and pass the same resolutions
although we had in general a common view and a common sentiment
so that these meetings which the judge has alluded to
and the resolutions he has read from
were local
and did not spread over the whole state
we at last met together in 1886
from all parts of the state
and we agreed upon a common platform
who held more extreme notions
either yielded those notions
if not wholly yielding them
agreed to yield them practically
for the sake of embodying the opposition to the measures which the opposite party were pushing forward at that time
we met you then
and if there was anything yielded
it was for practical purposes
we agreed then upon a platform for the party throughout the entire state of illinois
and now we are all bound
as a party
to that platform
and i say here to you
if any one expects of me in case of my election that i will do anything not signified by our republican platform and my answers here to day
i tell you very frankly that person will be deceived
i do not ask for the vote of any one who supposes that i have secret purposes or pledges that i dare not speak out
cannot the judge be satisfied
if he fears
in the unfortunate case of my election
that my going to washington will enable me to advocate sentiments contrary to those which i expressed when you voted for and elected me
i assure him that his fears are wholly needless and groundless
is the judge really afraid of any such thing
i'll tell you what he is afraid of
he is afraid we'll all pull together
this is what alarms him more than anything else
for my part
i do hope that all of us
entertaining a common sentiment in opposition to what appears to us a design to nationalize and perpetuate slavery
will waive minor differences on questions which either belong to the dead past or the distant future
and all pull together in this struggle
what are your sentiments
if it be true that on the ground which i occupy ground which i occupy as frankly and boldly as judge douglas does his
my views
though partly coinciding with yours
are not as perfectly in accordance with your feelings as his are
i do say to you in all candor
go for him
and not for me
i hope to deal in all things fairly with judge douglas
and with the people of the state
in this contest
and if i should never be elected to any office
i trust i may go down with no stain of falsehood upon my reputation
notwithstanding the hard opinions judge douglas chooses to entertain of me
the judge has again addressed himself to the abolition tendencies of a speech of mine made at springfield in june last
i have so often tried to answer what he is always saying on that melancholy theme that i almost turn with disgust from the discussion
from the repetition of an answer to it
i trust that nearly all of this intelligent audience have read that speech
if you have
i may venture to leave it to you to inspect it closely
and see whether it contains any of those bugaboos which frighten judge douglas
the judge complains that i did not fully answer his questions
if i have the sense to comprehend and answer those questions
i have done so fairly
if it can be pointed out to me how i can more fully and fairly answer him
i aver i have not the sense to see how it is to be done
he says i do not declare i would in any event vote for the admission of a slave state into the union
if i have been fairly reported
he will see that i did give an explicit answer to his interrogatories i did not merely say that i would dislike to be put to the test
but i said clearly
if i were put to the test
and a territory from which slavery had been excluded should present herself with a state constitution sanctioning slavery
a most extraordinary thing
and wholly unlikely to happen
i did not see how i could avoid voting for her admission
but he refuses to understand that i said so
and he wants this audience to understand that i did not say so
yet it will be so reported in the printed speech that he cannot help seeing it
he says if i should vote for the admission of a slave state i would be voting for a dissolution of the union
because i hold that the union cannot permanently exist half slave and half free
i repeat that i do not believe this government can endure permanently half slave and half free yet i do not admit
nor does it at all follow
that the admission of a single slave state will permanently fix the character and establish this as a universal slave nation
the judge is very happy indeed at working up these quibbles
before leaving the subject of answering questions
i aver as my confident belief
when you come to see our speeches in print
that you will find every question which he has asked me more fairly and boldly and fully answered than he has answered those which i put to him
is not that so
the two speeches may be placed side by side
and i will venture to leave it to impartial judges whether his questions have not been more directly and circumstantially answered than mine
judge douglas says he made a charge upon the editor of the washington union
of entertaining a purpose to rob the states of their power to exclude slavery from their limits
i undertake to say
and i make the direct issue
that he did not make his charge against the editor of the union alone
i will undertake to prove by the record here that he made that charge against more and higher dignitaries than the editor of the washington union
i am quite aware that he was shirking and dodging around the form in which he put it
but i can make it manifest that he leveled his fatal blow against more persons than this washington editor
will he dodge it now by alleging that i am trying to defend mr
buchanan against the charge
not at all
am i not making the same charge myself
i am trying to show that you
judge douglas
are a witness on my side
i am not defending buchanan
and i will tell judge douglas that in my opinion
when he made that charge
he had an eye farther north than he has to day
he was then fighting against people who called him a black republican and an abolitionist
it is mixed all through his speech
and it is tolerably manifest that his eye was a great deal farther north than it is to day
the judge says that though he made this charge
toombs got up and declared there was not a man in the united states
except the editor of the union
who was in favor of the doctrines put forth in that article
and thereupon i understand that the judge withdrew the charge
although he had taken extracts from the newspaper
and then from the lecompton constitution
to show the existence of a conspiracy to bring about a fatal blow
by which the states were to be deprived of the right of excluding slavery
it all went to pot as soon as toombs got up and told him it was not true
it reminds me of the story that john phoenix
the california railroad surveyor
he says they started out from the plaza to the mission of dolores
they had two ways of determining distances
one was by a chain and pins taken over the ground
the other was by a go it ometer
an invention of his own
a three legged instrument
with which he computed a series of triangles between the points
at night he turned to the chain man to ascertain what distance they had come
and found that by some mistake he had merely dragged the chain over the ground
without keeping any record
by the go it ometer
he found he had made ten miles
being skeptical about this
he asked a drayman who was passing how far it was to the plaza
the drayman replied it was just half a mile and the surveyor put it down in his book
just as judge douglas says
after he had made his calculations and computations
he took toombs's statement
i have no doubt that after judge douglas had made his charge
he was as easily satisfied about its truth as the surveyor was of the drayman's statement of the distance to the plaza
yet it is a fact that the man who put forth all that matter which douglas deemed a fatal blow at state sovereignty was elected by the democrats as public printer
you may take judge douglas's speech of march 22
beginning about the middle of page 21
and reading to the bottom of page 24
and you will find the evidence on which i say that he did not make his charge against the editor of the union alone
i cannot stop to read it
but i will give it to the reporters
judge douglas said
you here find several distinct propositions advanced boldly by the washington union editorially
and apparently authoritatively
and every man who questions any of them is denounced as an abolitionist
a free soiler
a fanatic
the propositions are
that the primary object of all government at its original institution is the protection of persons and property second
that the constitution of the united states declares that the citizens of each state shall be entitled to all the privileges and immunities of citizens in the several states and that
all state laws
whether organic or otherwise
which prohibit the citizens of one state from settling in another with their slave property
and especially declaring it forfeited
are direct violations of the original intention of the government and constitution of the united states and
that the emancipation of the slaves of the northern states was a gross outrage on the rights of property
in as much as it was involuntarily done on the part of the owner
remember that this article was published in the union on the 17th of november
and on the 18th appeared the first article giving the adhesion of the union to the lecompton constitution
it was in these words
kansas and her constitution
the vexed question is settled
the problem is solved
the dead point of danger is passed
all serious trouble to kansas affairs is over and gone
and a column
of the same sort
when you come to look into the lecompton constitution
you find the same doctrine incorporated in it which was put forth editorially in the union
what is it
article 7
section i
the right of property is before and higher than any constitutional sanction and the right of the owner of a slave to such slave and its increase is the same and as invariable as the right of the owner of any property whatever
 then in the schedule is a provision that the constitution may be amended after 1864 by a two thirds vote
but no alteration shall be made to affect the right of property in the ownership of slaves
 it will be seen by these clauses in the lecompton constitution that they are identical in spirit with this authoritative article in the washington union of the day previous to its indorsement of this constitution
when i saw that article in the union of the 17th of november
followed by the glorification of the lecompton constitution on the 18th of november
and this clause in the constitution asserting the doctrine that a state has no right to prohibit slavery within its limits
i saw that there was a fatal blow being struck at the sovereignty of the states of this union
here he says
you here find several distinct propositions advanced boldly
and apparently authoritatively
by whose authority
judge douglas
he says in another place
it will be seen by these clauses in the lecompton constitution that they are identical in spirit with this authoritative article
by whose authority
who do you mean to say authorized the publication of these articles
he knows that the washington union is considered the organ of the administration
i demand of judge douglas by whose authority he meant to say those articles were published
if not by the authority of the president of the united states and his cabinet
i defy him to show whom he referred to
if not to these high functionaries in the federal government
more than this
he says the articles in that paper and the provisions of the lecompton constitution are identical
and
being identical
he argues that the authors are co operating and conspiring together
he does not use the word conspiring
but what other construction can you put upon it
he winds up
when i saw that article in the union of the 17th of november
followed by the glorification of the lecompton constitution on the 18th of november
and this clause in the constitution asserting the doctrine that a state has no right to prohibit slavery within its limits
i saw that there was a fatal blow being struck at the sovereignty of the states of this union
i ask him if all this fuss was made over the editor of this newspaper
it would be a terribly fatal blow indeed which a single man could strike
when no president
no cabinet officer
no member of congress
was giving strength and efficiency to the movement
out of respect to judge douglas's good sense i must believe he did n't manufacture his idea of the fatal character of that blow out of such a miserable scapegrace as he represents that editor to be
but the judge's eye is farther south now
it was very peculiarly and decidedly north
his hope rested on the idea of visiting the great black republican party
and making it the tail of his new kite
he knows he was then expecting from day to day to turn republican
and place himself at the head of our organization
he has found that these despised black republicans estimate him by a standard which he has taught them none too well
hence he is crawling back into his old camp
and you will find him eventually installed in full fellowship among those whom he was then battling
and with whom he now pretends to be at such fearful variance
third joint debate
at jonesboro
september 15
1858 mr
lincoln's reply
ladies and gentlemen
there is very much in the principles that judge douglas has here enunciated that i most cordially approve
and over which i shall have no controversy with him
in so far as he has insisted that all the states have the right to do exactly as they please about all their domestic relations
including that of slavery
i agree entirely with him
he places me wrong in spite of all i can tell him
though i repeat it again and again
insisting that i have no difference with him upon this subject
i have made a great many speeches
some of which have been printed
and it will be utterly impossible for him to find anything that i have ever put in print contrary to what i now say upon this subject
i hold myself under constitutional obligations to allow the people in all the states
without interference
direct or indirect
to do exactly as they please and i deny that i have any inclination to interfere with them
even if there were no such constitutional obligation
i can only say again that i am placed improperly altogether improperly
in spite of all i can say when it is insisted that i entertain any other view or purposes in regard to that matter
while i am upon this subject
i will make some answers briefly to certain propositions that judge douglas has put
he says
why can't this union endure permanently half slave and half free
i have said that i supposed it could not
and i will try
before this new audience
to give briefly some of the reasons for entertaining that opinion
another form of his question is
why can't we let it stand as our fathers placed it
that is the exact difficulty between us
i say that judge douglas and his friends have changed it from the position in which our fathers originally placed it
i say
in the way our father's originally left the slavery question
the institution was in the course of ultimate extinction
and the public mind rested in the belief that it was in the course of ultimate extinction
i say when this government was first established it was the policy of its founders to prohibit the spread of slavery into the new territories of the united states
where it had not existed
but judge douglas and his friends have broken up that policy
and placed it upon a new basis
by which it is to become national and perpetual
all i have asked or desired anywhere is that it should be placed back again upon the basis that the fathers of our government originally placed it upon
i have no doubt that it would become extinct
for all time to come
if we but readopted the policy of the fathers
by restricting it to the limits it has already covered
restricting it from the new territories
i do not wish to dwell at great length on this branch of the subject at this time
but allow me to repeat one thing that i have stated before
brooks the man who assaulted senator sumner on the floor of the senate
and who was complimented with dinners
and silver pitchers
and gold headed canes
and a good many other things for that feat in one of his speeches declared that when this government was originally established
nobody expected that the institution of slavery would last until this day
that was but the opinion of one man
but it was such an opinion as we can never get from judge douglas or anybody in favor of slavery
in the north
at all
you can sometimes get it from a southern man
he said at the same time that the framers of our government did not have the knowledge that experience has taught us that experience and the invention of the cotton gin have taught us that the perpetuation of slavery is a necessity
he insisted
upon its being changed from the basis upon which the fathers of the government left it to the basis of its perpetuation and nationalization
i insist that this is the difference between judge douglas and myself
that judge douglas is helping that change along
i insist upon this government being placed where our fathers originally placed it
i remember judge douglas once said that he saw the evidences on the statute books of congress of a policy in the origin of government to divide slavery and freedom by a geographical line that he saw an indisposition to maintain that policy
and therefore he set about studying up a way to settle the institution on the right basis
the basis which he thought it ought to have been placed upon at first and in that speech he confesses that he seeks to place it
not upon the basis that the fathers placed it upon
but upon one gotten up on original principles
when he asks me why we cannot get along with it in the attitude where our fathers placed it
he had better clear up the evidences that he has himself changed it from that basis
that he has himself been chiefly instrumental in changing the policy of the fathers
any one who will read his speech of the 22d of last march will see that he there makes an open confession
showing that he set about fixing the institution upon an altogether different set of principles
i think i have fully answered him when he asks me why we cannot let it alone upon the basis where our fathers left it
by showing that he has himself changed the whole policy of the government in that regard
in regard to this matter about a contract that was made between judge trumbull and myself
and all that long portion of judge douglas's speech on this subject
i wish simply to say what i have said to him before
that he cannot know whether it is true or not
and i do know that there is not a word of truth in it
and i have told him so before
i don't want any harsh language indulged in
but i do not know how to deal with this persistent insisting on a story that i know to be utterly without truth
it used to be a fashion amongst men that when a charge was made
some sort of proof was brought forward to establish it
and if no proof was found to exist
the charge was dropped
i don't know how to meet this kind of an argument
i don't want to have a fight with judge douglas
and i have no way of making an argument up into the consistency of a corn cob and stopping his mouth with it
all i can do is good humoredly to say that
from the beginning to the end of all that story about a bargain between judge trumbull and myself
there is not a word of truth in it
i can only ask him to show some sort of evidence of the truth of his story
he brings forward here and reads from what he contends is a speech by james h
charging such a bargain between trumbull and myself
my own opinion is that matheny did do some such immoral thing as to tell a story that he knew nothing about
i believe he did
i contradicted it instantly
and it has been contradicted by judge trumbull
while nobody has produced any proof
because there is none
whether the speech which the judge brings forward here is really the one matheny made
i do not know
and i hope the judge will pardon me for doubting the genuineness of this document
since his production of those springfield resolutions at ottawa
i do not wish to dwell at any great length upon this matter
i can say nothing when a long story like this is told
except it is not true
and demand that he who insists upon it shall produce some proof
that is all any man can do
and i leave it in that way
for i know of no other way of dealing with it
in an argument on the lines of
you did
i did not
it bears on the former to prove his point
not on the negative to prove that he did not even if he easily can do so
the judge has gone over a long account of the old whig and democratic parties
and it connects itself with this charge against trumbull and myself
he says that they agreed upon a compromise in regard to the slavery question in 1850 that in a national democratic convention resolutions were passed to abide by that compromise as a finality upon the slavery question
he also says that the whig party in national convention agreed to abide by and regard as a finality the compromise of 1850
i understand the judge to be altogether right about that i understand that part of the history of the country as stated by him to be correct i recollect that i
as a member of that party
acquiesced in that compromise
i recollect in the presidential election which followed
when we had general scott up for the presidency
judge douglas was around berating us whigs as abolitionists
precisely as he does to day
not a bit of difference
i have often heard him
we could do nothing when the old whig party was alive that was not abolitionism
but it has got an extremely good name since it has passed away
it almost a natural law that
when dead no matter how bad we were we are automatically beatified
when that compromise was made it did not repeal the old missouri compromise
it left a region of united states territory half as large as the present territory of the united states
north of the line of 36 degrees 30 minutes
in which slavery was prohibited by act of congress
this compromise did not repeal that one
it did not affect or propose to repeal it
but at last it became judge douglas's duty
as he thought and i find no fault with him
as chairman of the committee on territories
to bring in a bill for the organization of a territorial government
first of one
then of two territories north of that line
when he did so
it ended in his inserting a provision substantially repealing the missouri compromise
that was because the compromise of 1850 had not repealed it
and now i ask why he could not have let that compromise alone
we were quiet from the agitation of the slavery question
we were making no fuss about it
all had acquiesced in the compromise measures of 1850
we never had been seriously disturbed by any abolition agitation before that period
when he came to form governments for the territories north of the line of 36 degrees 30 minutes
why could he not have let that matter stand as it was standing
was it necessary to the organization of a territory
not at all
iowa lay north of the line
and had been organized as a territory and come into the union as a state without disturbing that compromise
there was no sort of necessity for destroying it to organize these territories
it would take up all my time to meet all the little quibbling arguments of judge douglas to show that the missouri compromise was repealed by the compromise of 1850
my own opinion is
that a careful investigation of all the arguments to sustain the position that that compromise was virtually repealed by the compromise of 1850 would show that they are the merest fallacies
i have the report that judge douglas first brought into congress at the time of the introduction of the nebraska bill
which in its original form did not repeal the missouri compromise
and he there expressly stated that he had forborne to do so because it had not been done by the compromise of 1850
i close this part of the discussion on my part by asking him the question again
when we had peace under the missouri compromise
could you not have let it alone
in complaining of what i said in my speech at springfield
in which he says i accepted my nomination for the senatorship where
by the way
he is at fault
for if he will examine it
he will find no acceptance in it
he again quotes that portion in which i said that a house divided against itself cannot stand
let me say a word in regard to that matter
he tries to persuade us that there must be a variety in the different institutions of the states of the union that that variety necessarily proceeds from the variety of soil
of the face of the country
and the difference in the natural features of the states
i agree to all that
have these very matters ever produced any difficulty amongst us
not at all
have we ever had any quarrel over the fact that they have laws in louisiana designed to regulate the commerce that springs from the production of sugar
or because we have a different class relative to the production of flour in this state
have they produced any differences
not at all
they are the very cements of this union
they don't make the house a house divided against itself
they are the props that hold up the house and sustain the union
but has it been so with this element of slavery
have we not always had quarrels and difficulties over it
and when will we cease to have quarrels over it
like causes produce like effects
it is worth while to observe that we have generally had comparative peace upon the slavery question
and that there has been no cause for alarm until it was excited by the effort to spread it into new territory
whenever it has been limited to its present bounds
and there has been no effort to spread it
there has been peace
all the trouble and convulsion has proceeded from efforts to spread it over more territory
it was thus at the date of the missouri compromise
it was so again with the annexation of texas so with the territory acquired by the mexican war and it is so now
whenever there has been an effort to spread it
there has been agitation and resistance
i appeal to this audience very few of whom are my political friends
as national men
whether we have reason to expect that the agitation in regard to this subject will cease while the causes that tend to reproduce agitation are actively at work
will not the same cause that produced agitation in 1820
when the missouri compromise was formed
that which produced the agitation upon the annexation of texas
and at other times
work out the same results always
do you think that the nature of man will be changed
that the same causes that produced agitation at one time will not have the same effect at another
this has been the result so far as my observation of the slavery question and my reading in history extends
what right have we then to hope that the trouble will cease
that the agitation will come to an end
until it shall either be placed back where it originally stood
and where the fathers originally placed it
on the other hand
until it shall entirely master all opposition
this is the view i entertain
and this is the reason why i entertained it
as judge douglas has read from my springfield speech
my friends
there is one other thing that i feel myself under some sort of obligation to mention
judge douglas has here to day in a very rambling way
i was about saying spoken of the platforms for which he seeks to hold me responsible
he says
why can't you come out and make an open avowal of principles in all places alike
and he reads from an advertisement that he says was used to notify the people of a speech to be made by judge trumbull at waterloo
in commenting on it he desires to know whether we cannot speak frankly and manfully
as he and his friends do
i ask
do his friends speak out their own sentiments
a convention of his party in this state met on the 21st of april at springfield
and passed a set of resolutions which they proclaim to the country as their platform
this does constitute their platform
and it is because judge douglas claims it is his platform that these are his principles and purposes that he has a right to declare he speaks his sentiments frankly and manfully
on the 9th of june colonel john dougherty
governor reynolds
and others
calling themselves national democrats
met in springfield and adopted a set of resolutions which are as easily understood
as plain and as definite in stating to the country and to the world what they believed in and would stand upon
as judge douglas's platform now
what is the reason that judge douglas is not willing that colonel dougherty and governor reynolds should stand upon their own written and printed platform as well as he upon his
why must he look farther than their platform when he claims himself to stand by his platform
in reference to our platform
on the 16th of june the republicans had their convention and published their platform
which is as clear and distinct as judge douglas's
in it they spoke their principles as plainly and as definitely to the world
what is the reason that judge douglas is not willing i should stand upon that platform
why must he go around hunting for some one who is supporting me or has supported me at some time in his life
and who has said something at some time contrary to that platform
does the judge regard that rule as a good one
if it turn out that the rule is a good one for me that i am responsible for any and every opinion that any man has expressed who is my friend
then it is a good rule for him
i ask
is it not as good a rule for him as it is for me
in my opinion
it is not a good rule for either of us
do you think differently
i do not
judge douglas says he does not think differently
i am glad of it
then can he tell me why he is looking up resolutions of five or six years ago
and insisting that they were my platform
notwithstanding my protest that they are not
and never were my platform
and my pointing out the platform of the state convention which he delights to say nominated me for the senate
i cannot see what he means by parading these resolutions
if it is not to hold me responsible for them in some way
if he says to me here that he does not hold the rule to be good
one way or the other
i do not comprehend how he could answer me more fully if he answered me at greater length
i will therefore put in as my answer to the resolutions that he has hunted up against me
what i
as a lawyer
would call a good plea to a bad declaration
i understand that it is an axiom of law that a poor plea may be a good plea to a bad declaration
i think that the opinions the judge brings from those who support me
yet differ from me
is a bad declaration against me but if i can bring the same things against him
i am putting in a good plea to that kind of declaration
and now i propose to try it
at freeport
judge douglas occupied a large part of his time in producing resolutions and documents of various sorts
as i understood
to make me somehow responsible for them and i propose now doing a little of the same sort of thing for him
in 1850 a very clever gentleman by the name of thompson campbell
a personal friend of judge douglas and myself
a political friend of judge douglas and opponent of mine
was a candidate for congress in the galena district
he was interrogated as to his views on this same slavery question
i have here before me the interrogatories
and campbell's answers to them i will read them
will you
if elected
vote for and cordially support a bill prohibiting slavery in the territories of the united states
will you vote for and support a bill abolishing slavery in the district of columbia
will you oppose the admission of any slave states which may be formed out of texas or the territories
will you vote for and advocate the repeal of the fugitive slave law passed at the recent session of congress
will you advocate and vote for the election of a speaker of the house of representatives who shall be willing to organize the committees of that house so as to give the free states their just influence in the business of legislation
what are your views
not only as to the constitutional right of congress to prohibit the slave trade between the states
but also as to the expediency of exercising that right immediately
campbell's reply
to the first and second interrogatories
i answer unequivocally in the affirmative
to the third interrogatory i reply
that i am opposed to the admission of any more slave states into the union
that may be formed out of texas or any other territory
to the fourth and fifth interrogatories i unhesitatingly answer in the affirmative
to the sixth interrogatory i reply
that so long as the slave states continue to treat slaves as articles of commerce
the constitution confers power on congress to pass laws regulating that peculiar commerce
and that the protection of human rights imperatively demands the interposition of every constitutional means to prevent this most inhuman and iniquitous traffic
i want to say here that thompson campbell was elected to congress on that platform
as the democratic candidate in the galena district
against martin p
judge douglas
give me the date of the letter
the time campbell ran was in 1850
i have not the exact date here
it was some time in 1850 that these interrogatories were put and the answer given
campbell was elected to congress
and served out his term
i think a second election came up before he served out his term
and he was not re elected
whether defeated or not nominated
i do not know
campbell was nominated for re election by the democratic party
by acclamation
at the end of his term his very good friend judge douglas got him a high office from president pierce
and sent him off to california
is not that the fact
just at the end of his term in congress it appears that our mutual friend judge douglas got our mutual friend campbell a good office
and sent him to california upon it
and not only so
but on the 27th of last month
when judge douglas and myself spoke at freeport in joint discussion
there was his same friend campbell
come all the way from california
to help the judge beat me and there was poor martin p
sweet standing on the platform
trying to help poor me to be elected
that is true of one of judge douglas's friends
so again
in that same race of 1850
there was a congressional convention assembled at joliet
and it nominated r
molony for congress
and unanimously adopted the following resolution
that we are uncompromisingly opposed to the extension of slavery and while we would not make such opposition a ground of interference with the interests of the states where it exists
yet we moderately but firmly insist that it is the duty of congress to oppose its extension into territory now free
by all means compatible with the obligations of the constitution
and with good faith to our sister states that these principles were recognized by the ordinance of 1787
which received the sanction of thomas jefferson
who is acknowledged by all to be the great oracle and expounder of our faith
subsequently the same interrogatories were propounded to dr
molony which had been addressed to campbell as above
with the exception of the 6th
respecting the interstate slave trade
to which dr
the democratic nominee for congress
replied as follows
i received the written interrogatories this day
as you will see by the la salle democrat and ottawa free trader
i took at peru on the 5th
and at ottawa on the 7th
the affirmative side of interrogatories 1st and 2d and in relation to the admission of any more slave states from free territory
my position taken at these meetings
as correctly reported in said papers
was emphatically and distinctly opposed to it
in relation to the admission of any more slave states from texas
whether i shall go against it or not will depend upon the opinion that i may hereafter form of the true meaning and nature of the resolutions of annexation
by said resolutions
the honor and good faith of the nation is pledged to admit more slave states from texas when she texas may apply for the admission of such state
then i should
if in congress
vote for their admission
but if not so pledged and bound by sacred contract
then a bill for the admission of more slave states from texas would never receive my vote
to your fourth interrogatory i answer most decidedly in the affirmative
and for reasons set forth in my reported remarks at ottawa last monday
to your fifth interrogatory i also reply in the affirmative most cordially
and that i will use my utmost exertions to secure the nomination and election of a man who will accomplish the objects of said interrogatories
i most cordially approve of the resolutions adopted at the union meeting held at princeton on the 27th september ult
all i have to say in regard to dr
molony is that he was the regularly nominated democratic candidate for congress in his district was elected at that time at the end of his term was appointed to a land office at danville
i never heard anything of judge douglas's instrumentality in this
he held this office a considerable time
and when we were at freeport the other day there were handbills scattered about notifying the public that after our debate was over r
molony would make a democratic speech in favor of judge douglas
that is all i know of my own personal knowledge
it is added here to this resolution
and truly i believe
that among those who participated in the joliet convention
and who supported its nominee
with his platform as laid down in the resolution of the convention and in his reply as above given
we call at random the following names
all of which are recognized at this day as leading democrats
cook county
charles mcdonell
arno voss
thomas hoyne
isaac cook
i reckon we ought to except cook
joel a
elijah wilcox
enos w
neil donnelly
la salle
john hise
william reddick
william reddick
another one of judge douglas's friends that stood on the stand with him at ottawa
at the time the judge says my knees trembled so that i had to be carried away
the names are all here
du page
nathan allen
de kalb
here is another set of resolutions which i think are apposite to the matter in hand
on the 28th of february of the same year a democratic district convention was held at naperville to nominate a candidate for circuit judge
among the delegates were bowen and kelly of will captain naper
nathan allen
of du page w
and enos w
smith of mchenry j
horssnan and others of winnebago
colonel strode presided over the convention
the following resolutions were unanimously adopted
the first on motion of p
the second on motion of william m
that this convention is in favor of the wilmot proviso
both in principle and practice
and that we know of no good reason why any person should oppose the largest latitude in free soil
free territory and free speech
that in the opinion of this convention
the time has arrived when all men should be free
whites as well as others
judge douglas
what is the date of those resolutions
i understand it was in 1850
but i do not know it
i do not state a thing and say i know it
when i do not
but i have the highest belief that this is so
i know of no way to arrive at the conclusion that there is an error in it
i mean to put a case no stronger than the truth will allow
but what i was going to comment upon is an extract from a newspaper in de kalb county and it strikes me as being rather singular
i confess
under the circumstances
there is a judge mayo in that county
who is a candidate for the legislature
for the purpose
if he secures his election
of helping to re elect judge douglas
he is the editor of a newspaper de kalb county sentinel
and in that paper i find the extract i am going to read
it is part of an editorial article in which he was electioneering as fiercely as he could for judge douglas and against me
it was a curious thing
i think
to be in such a paper
i will agree to that
and the judge may make the most of it
our education has been such that we have been rather in favor of the equality of the blacks that is
that they should enjoy all the privileges of the whites where they reside
we are aware that this is not a very popular doctrine
we have had many a confab with some who are now strong 'republicans' we taking the broad ground of equality
and they the opposite ground
we were brought up in a state where blacks were voters
and we do not know of any inconvenience resulting from it
though perhaps it would not work as well where the blacks are more numerous
we have no doubt of the right of the whites to guard against such an evil
if it is one
our opinion is that it would be best for all concerned to have the colored population in a state by themselves in this i agree with him but if within the jurisdiction of the united states
we say by all means they should have the right to have their senators and representatives in congress
and to vote for president
with us 'worth makes the man
and want of it the fellow
 we have seen many a 'nigger' that we thought more of than some white men
that is one of judge douglas's friends
i do not want to leave myself in an attitude where i can be misrepresented
so i will say i do not think the judge is responsible for this article but he is quite as responsible for it as i would be if one of my friends had said it
i think that is fair enough
i have here also a set of resolutions passed by a democratic state convention in judge douglas's own good state of vermont
that i think ought to be good for him too
that liberty is a right inherent and inalienable in man
and that herein all men are equal
that we claim no authority in the federal government to abolish slavery in the several states
but we do claim for it constitutional power perpetually to prohibit the introduction of slavery into territory now free
and abolish it wherever
under the jurisdiction of congress
it exists
that this power ought immediately to be exercised in prohibiting the introduction and existence of slavery in new mexico and california
in abolishing slavery and the slave trade in the district of columbia
on the high seas
and wherever else
under the constitution
it can be reached
that no more slave states should be admitted into the federal union
that the government ought to return to its ancient policy
not to extend
or encourage
but to limit
and discourage slavery
at freeport i answered several interrogatories that had been propounded to me by judge douglas at the ottawa meeting
the judge has not yet seen fit to find any fault with the position that i took in regard to those seven interrogatories
which were certainly broad enough
in all conscience
to cover the entire ground
in my answers
which have been printed
and all have had the opportunity of seeing
i take the ground that those who elect me must expect that i will do nothing which will not be in accordance with those answers
i have some right to assert that judge douglas has no fault to find with them
but he chooses to still try to thrust me upon different ground
without paying any attention to my answers
the obtaining of which from me cost him so much trouble and concern
at the same time i propounded four interrogatories to him
claiming it as a right that he should answer as many interrogatories for me as i did for him
and i would reserve myself for a future instalment when i got them ready
the judge
in answering me upon that occasion
put in what i suppose he intends as answers to all four of my interrogatories
the first one of these interrogatories i have before me
and it is in these words
question 1
if the people of kansas shall
by means entirely unobjectionable in all other respects
adopt a state constitution
and ask admission into the union under it
before they have the requisite number of inhabitants according to the english bill
some ninety three thousand
will you vote to admit them
as i read the judge's answer in the newspaper
and as i remember it as pronounced at the time
he does not give any answer which is equivalent to yes or no
i will or i won't
he answers at very considerable length
rather quarreling with me for asking the question
and insisting that judge trumbull had done something that i ought to say something about
and finally getting out such statements as induce me to infer that he means to be understood he will
in that supposed case
vote for the admission of kansas
i only bring this forward now for the purpose of saying that if he chooses to put a different construction upon his answer
he may do it
but if he does not
i shall from this time forward assume that he will vote for the admission of kansas in disregard of the english bill
he has the right to remove any misunderstanding i may have
i only mention it now
that i may hereafter assume this to be the true construction of his answer
if he does not now choose to correct me
the second interrogatory that i propounded to him was this
question 2
can the people of a united states territory
in any lawful way
against the wish of any citizen of the united states
exclude slavery from its limits prior to the formation of a state constitution
to this judge douglas answered that they can lawfully exclude slavery from the territory prior to the formation of a constitution
he goes on to tell us how it can be done
as i understand him
he holds that it can be done by the territorial legislature refusing to make any enactments for the protection of slavery in the territory
and especially by adopting unfriendly legislation to it
for the sake of clearness
i state it again
that they can exclude slavery from the territory
by withholding what he assumes to be an indispensable assistance to it in the way of legislation and
by unfriendly legislation
if i rightly understand him
i wish to ask your attention for a while to his position
in the first place
the supreme court of the united states has decided that any congressional prohibition of slavery in the territories is unconstitutional that they have reached this proposition as a conclusion from their former proposition
that the constitution of the united states expressly recognizes property in slaves
and from that other constitutional provision
that no person shall be deprived of property without due process of law
hence they reach the conclusion that as the constitution of the united states expressly recognizes property in slaves
and prohibits any person from being deprived of property without due process of law
to pass an act of congress by which a man who owned a slave on one side of a line would be deprived of him if he took him on the other side
is depriving him of that property without due process of law
that i understand to be the decision of the supreme court
i understand also that judge douglas adheres most firmly to that decision and the difficulty is
how is it possible for any power to exclude slavery from the territory
unless in violation of that decision
that is the difficulty
in the senate of the united states
in 1850
judge trumbull
in a speech substantially
if not directly
put the same interrogatory to judge douglas
as to whether the people of a territory had the lawful power to exclude slavery prior to the formation of a constitution
judge douglas then answered at considerable length
and his answer will be found in the congressional globe
under date of june 9th
the judge said that whether the people could exclude slavery prior to the formation of a constitution or not was a question to be decided by the supreme court
he put that proposition
as will be seen by the congressional globe
in a variety of forms
all running to the same thing in substance
that it was a question for the supreme court
i maintain that when he says
after the supreme court have decided the question
that the people may yet exclude slavery by any means whatever
he does virtually say that it is not a question for the supreme court
he shifts his ground
i appeal to you whether he did not say it was a question for the supreme court
has not the supreme court decided that question
when he now says the people may exclude slavery
does he not make it a question for the people
does he not virtually shift his ground and say that it is not a question for the court
but for the people
this is a very simple proposition
a very plain and naked one
it seems to me that there is no difficulty in deciding it
in a variety of ways he said that it was a question for the supreme court
he did not stop then to tell us that
whatever the supreme court decides
the people can by withholding necessary police regulations keep slavery out
he did not make any such answer i submit to you now whether the new state of the case has not induced the judge to sheer away from his original ground
would not this be the impression of every fair minded man
i hold that the proposition that slavery cannot enter a new country without police regulations is historically false
it is not true at all
i hold that the history of this country shows that the institution of slavery was originally planted upon this continent without these police regulations
which the judge now thinks necessary for the actual establishment of it
not only so
but is there not another fact
how came this dred scott decision to be made
it was made upon the case of a negro being taken and actually held in slavery in minnesota territory
claiming his freedom because the act of congress prohibited his being so held there
will the judge pretend that dred scott was not held there without police regulations
there is at least one matter of record as to his having been held in slavery in the territory
not only without police regulations
but in the teeth of congressional legislation supposed to be valid at the time
this shows that there is vigor enough in slavery to plant itself in a new country even against unfriendly legislation
it takes not only law
but the enforcement of law to keep it out
that is the history of this country upon the subject
i wish to ask one other question
it being understood that the constitution of the united states guarantees property in slaves in the territories
if there is any infringement of the right of that property
would not the united states courts
organized for the government of the territory
apply such remedy as might be necessary in that case
it is a maxim held by the courts that there is no wrong without its remedy and the courts have a remedy for whatever is acknowledged and treated as a wrong
i will ask you
my friends
if you were elected members of the legislature
what would be the first thing you would have to do before entering upon your duties
swear to support the constitution of the united states
suppose you believe
as judge douglas does
that the constitution of the united states guarantees to your neighbor the right to hold slaves in that territory that they are his property
how can you clear your oaths unless you give him such legislation as is necessary to enable him to enjoy that property
what do you understand by supporting the constitution of a state
or of the united states
is it not to give such constitutional helps to the rights established by that constitution as may be practically needed
can you
if you swear to support the constitution
and believe that the constitution establishes a right
clear your oath
without giving it support
do you support the constitution if
knowing or believing there is a right established under it which needs specific legislation
you withhold that legislation
do you not violate and disregard your oath
i can conceive of nothing plainer in the world
there can be nothing in the words support the constitution
if you may run counter to it by refusing support to any right established under the constitution
and what i say here will hold with still more force against the judge's doctrine of unfriendly legislation
how could you
having sworn to support the constitution
and believing it guaranteed the right to hold slaves in the territories
assist in legislation intended to defeat that right
that would be violating your own view of the constitution
not only so
but if you were to do so
how long would it take the courts to hold your votes unconstitutional and void
not a moment
i would ask
is not congress itself under obligation to give legislative support to any right that is established under the united states constitution
i repeat the question
is not congress itself bound to give legislative support to any right that is established in the united states constitution
a member of congress swears to support the constitution of the united states
and if he sees a right established by that constitution which needs specific legislative protection
can he clear his oath without giving that protection
let me ask you why many of us who are opposed to slavery upon principle give our acquiescence to a fugitive slave law
why do we hold ourselves under obligations to pass such a law
and abide by it when it is passed
because the constitution makes provision that the owners of slaves shall have the right to reclaim them
it gives the right to reclaim slaves and that right is
as judge douglas says
a barren right
unless there is legislation that will enforce it
the mere declaration
no person held to service or labor in one state under the laws thereof
escaping into another
shall in consequence of any law or regulation therein be discharged from such service or labor
but shall be delivered up on claim of the party to whom such service or labor may be due
is powerless without specific legislation to enforce it
on what ground would a member of congress
who is opposed to slavery in the abstract
vote for a fugitive law
as i would deem it my duty to do
because there is a constitutional right which needs legislation to enforce it
and although it is distasteful to me
i have sworn to support the constitution and having so sworn
i cannot conceive that i do support it if i withhold from that right any necessary legislation to make it practical
and if that is true in regard to a fugitive slave law
is the right to have fugitive slaves reclaimed any better fixed in the constitution than the right to hold slaves in the territories
for this decision is a just exposition of the constitution
as judge douglas thinks
is the one right any better than the other
is there any man who
while a member of congress
would give support to the one any more than the other
if i wished to refuse to give legislative support to slave property in the territories
if a member of congress
i could not do it
holding the view that the constitution establishes that right
if i did it at all
it would be because i deny that this decision properly construes the constitution
but if i acknowledge
with judge douglas
that this decision properly construes the constitution
i cannot conceive that i would be less than a perjured man if i should refuse in congress to give such protection to that property as in its nature it needed
at the end of what i have said here i propose to give the judge my fifth interrogatory
which he may take and answer at his leisure
my fifth interrogatory is this
if the slaveholding citizens of a united states territory should need and demand congressional legislation for the protection of their slave property in such territory
would you
as a member of congress
vote for or against such legislation
judge douglas
will you repeat that
i want to answer that question
if the slaveholding citizens of a united states territory should need and demand congressional legislation for the protection of their slave property in such territory
would you
as a member of congress
vote for or against such legislation
i am aware that in some of the speeches judge douglas has made
he has spoken as if he did not know or think that the supreme court had decided that a territorial legislature cannot exclude slavery
precisely what the judge would say upon the subject whether he would say definitely that he does not understand they have so decided
or whether he would say he does understand that the court have so decided
i do not know but i know that in his speech at springfield he spoke of it as a thing they had not decided yet and in his answer to me at freeport
he spoke of it
so far
as i can comprehend it
as a thing that had not yet been decided
i hold that if the judge does entertain that view
i think that he is not mistaken in so far as it can be said that the court has not decided anything save the mere question of jurisdiction
i know the legal arguments that can be made
that after a court has decided that it cannot take jurisdiction in a case
it then has decided all that is before it
and that is the end of it
a plausible argument can be made in favor of that proposition but i know that judge douglas has said in one of his speeches that the court went forward
like honest men as they were
and decided all the points in the case
if any points are really extra judicially decided
because not necessarily before them
then this one as to the power of the territorial legislature
to exclude slavery is one of them
as also the one that the missouri compromise was null and void
they are both extra judicial
or neither is
according as the court held that they had no jurisdiction in the case between the parties
because of want of capacity of one party to maintain a suit in that court
i want
if i have sufficient time
to show that the court did pass its opinion but that is the only thing actually done in the case
if they did not decide
they showed what they were ready to decide whenever the matter was before them
what is that opinion
after having argued that congress had no power to pass a law excluding slavery from a united states territory
they then used language to this effect
that inasmuch as congress itself could not exercise such a power
it followed as a matter of course that it could not authorize a territorial government to exercise it for the territorial legislature can do no more than congress could do
thus it expressed its opinion emphatically against the power of a territorial legislature to exclude slavery
leaving us in just as little doubt on that point as upon any other point they really decided
my fellow citizens
i will detain you only a little while longer my time is nearly out
i find a report of a speech made by judge douglas at joliet
since we last met at freeport
i believe
in the missouri republican
on the 9th of this month
in which judge douglas says
you know at ottawa i read this platform
and asked him if he concurred in each and all of the principles set forth in it
he would not answer these questions
at last i said frankly
i wish you to answer them
because when i get them up here where the color of your principles are a little darker than in egypt
i intend to trot you down to jonesboro
the very notice that i was going to take him down to egypt made him tremble in his knees so that he had to be carried from the platform
he laid up seven days
and in the meantime held a consultation with his political physicians they had lovejoy and farnsworth and all the leaders of the abolition party
they consulted it all over
and at last lincoln came to the conclusion that he would answer
so he came up to freeport last friday
now
that statement altogether furnishes a subject for philosophical contemplation
i have been treating it in that way
and i have really come to the conclusion that i can explain it in no other way than by believing the judge is crazy
if he was in his right mind i cannot conceive how he would have risked disgusting the four or five thousand of his own friends who stood there and knew
as to my having been carried from the platform
that there was not a word of truth in it
judge douglas
did n't they carry you off
there that question illustrates the character of this man douglas exactly
he smiles now
and says
did n't they carry you off
but he said then he had to be carried off and he said it to convince the country that he had so completely broken me down by his speech that i had to be carried away
now he seeks to dodge it
and asks
did n't they carry you off
yes
they did
judge douglas
why didn't you tell the truth
i would like to know why you did n't tell the truth about it
and then again he laid up seven days
he put this in print for the people of the country to read as a serious document
i think if he had been in his sober senses he would not have risked that barefacedness in the presence of thousands of his own friends who knew that i made speeches within six of the seven days at henry
marshall county
hancock county
and macomb
mcdonough county
including all the necessary travel to meet him again at freeport at the end of the six days
now i say there is no charitable way to look at that statement
except to conclude that he is actually crazy
there is another thing in that statement that alarmed me very greatly as he states it
that he was going to trot me down to egypt
thereby he would have you infer that i would not come to egypt unless he forced me that i could not be got here unless he
had hauled me down here
that statement he makes
in the teeth of the knowledge that i had made the stipulation to come down here and that he himself had been very reluctant to enter into the stipulation
more than all this
judge douglas
when he made that statement
must have been crazy and wholly out of his sober senses
or else he would have known that when he got me down here
that promise that windy promise of his powers to annihilate me
would n't amount to anything
how little do i look like being carried away trembling
let the judge go on and after he is done with his half hour
i want you all
if i can't go home myself
to let me stay and rot here and if anything happens to the judge
if i cannot carry him to the hotel and put him to bed
let me stay here and rot
i say
here is something extraordinary in this statement
i ask you if you know any other living man who would make such a statement
i will ask my friend casey
over there
if he would do such a thing
would he send that out and have his men take it as the truth
did the judge talk of trotting me down to egypt to scare me to death
i know this people better than he does
i was raised just a little east of here
i am a part of this people
but the judge was raised farther north
and perhaps he has some horrid idea of what this people might be induced to do
but really i have talked about this matter perhaps longer than i ought
for it is no great thing and yet the smallest are often the most difficult things to deal with
the judge has set about seriously trying to make the impression that when we meet at different places i am literally in his clutches that i am a poor
decrepit mouse
and that i can do nothing at all
this is one of the ways he has taken to create that impression
i don't know any other way to meet it except this
i don't want to quarrel with him to call him a liar but when i come square up to him i don't know what else to call him if i must tell the truth out
i want to be at peace
and reserve all my fighting powers for necessary occasions
my time now is very nearly out
and i give up the trifle that is left to the judge
to let him set my knees trembling again
if he can
set my knees trembling again
if he can

except that you are to judge
and are not to allow your force to be disposed otherwise than so as to give the greatest protection to this capital which may be possible from that distance
to the secretary of war
the president having shown this to me
i suggested that it is dangerous to direct a subordinate not to obey the orders of his superior in any case
and that to give instructions to general mcclellan to this same end and furnish general mcdowell with a copy thereof would effect the object desired by the president
he desired me to say that the sketch of instructions to general mcclellan herewith he thought made this addition unnecessary

may 17
1862 no commanding general shall do such a thing upon my responsibility without consulting me
from secretary stanton to general mcclellan
may 18
your despatch to the president
asking reinforcements
has been received and carefully considered
the president is not willing to uncover the capital entirely and it is believed that
even if this were prudent
it would require more time to effect a junction between your army and that of the rappahannock by the way of the potomac and york rivers than by a land march
in order
to increase the strength of the attack upon richmond at the earliest moment
general mcdowell has been ordered to march upon that city by the shortest route
he is ordered
keeping himself always in position to save the capital from all possible attack
so to operate as to put his left wing in communication with your right wing
and you are instructed to co operate so as to establish this communication as soon as possible by extending your right wing to the north of richmond
it is believed that this communication can be safely established either north or south of the pamunkey river
in any event
you will be able to prevent the main body of the enemy's forces from leaving richmond and falling in overwhelming force upon general mcdowell
he will move with between thirty five and forty thousand men
a copy of the instructions to general mcdowell are with this
the specific task assigned to his command has been to provide against any danger to the capital of the nation
at your earnest call for reinforcements
he is sent forward to co operate in the reduction of richmond
but charged
in attempting this
not to uncover the city of washington and you will give no order
either before or after your junction
which can put him out of position to cover this city
you and he will communicate with each other by telegraph or otherwise as frequently as may be necessary for efficient cooperation
when general mcdowell is in position on your right
his supplies must be drawn from west point
and you will instruct your staff officers to be prepared to supply him by that route
the president desires that general mcdowell retain the command of the department of the rappahannock and of the forces with which he moves forward

the three states of georgia

comprising the military department of the south
having deliberately declared themselves no longer under the protection of the united states of america

it became a military necessity to declare martial law
this was accordingly done on the 25th day of april
slavery and martial law in a free country are altogether incompatible

proclaim and declare that the government of the united states
had no knowledge
or belief of an intention on the part of general hunter to issue such a proclamation nor has it yet any authentic information that the document is genuine
and further
that neither general hunter nor any other commander or person has been authorized by the government of the united states to make a proclamation declaring the slaves of any state free and that the supposed proclamation now in question
whether genuine or false
is altogether void so far as respects such a declaration
i further make known that whether it be competent for me
as commander in chief of the army and navy
to declare the slaves of any state or states free
and whether
at any time
in any case
it shall have become a necessity indispensable to the maintenance of the government to exercise such supposed power
are questions which under my responsibility i reserve to myself
and which i cannot feel justified in leaving to the decision of commanders in the field
these are totally different questions from those of police regulations in armies and camps
on the sixth day of march last
by special message
i recommended to congress the adoption of a joint resolution
to be substantially as follows
that the united states ought to co operate with any state which may adopt gradual abolishment of slavery
giving to such state pecuniary aid
to be used by such state
in its discretion
to compensate for the inconvenience
public and private
produced by such change of system
the resolution in the language above quoted was adopted by large majorities in both branches of congress
and now stands an authentic
and solemn proposal of the nation to the states and people most immediately interested in the subject matter
to the people of those states i now earnestly appeal
i do not argue i beseech you to make arguments for yourselves
you cannot
if you would
be blind to the signs of the times
i beg of you a calm and enlarged consideration of them
if it may be
far above personal and partisan politics
this proposal makes common cause for a common object
casting no reproaches upon any
it acts not the pharisee
the change it contemplates would come gently as the dews of heaven
not rending or wrecking anything
will you not embrace it
so much good has not been done

we have so thinned our line to get troops for other places that it was broken yesterday at front royal
with a probable loss to us of one regiment infantry
two companies cavalry
putting general banks in some peril
the enemy's forces under general anderson now opposing general mcdowell's advance have as their line of supply and retreat the road to richmond
in conjunction with mcdowell's movement against anderson
you could send a force from your right to cut off the enemy's supplies from richmond
preserve the railroad bridges across the two forks of the pamunkey
and intercept the enemy's retreat
you will prevent the army now opposed to you from receiving an accession of numbers of nearly 15
000 men and if you succeed in saving the bridges you will secure a line of railroad for supplies in addition to the one you now have
can you not do this almost as well as not while you are building the chickahominy bridges
mcdowell and shields both say they can
and positively will
move monday morning
i wish you to move cautiously and safely
you will have command of mcdowell

several despatches from assistant secretary scott and one from governor morton asking reinforcements for you have been received
i beg you to be assured we do the best we can
i mean to cast no blame where i tell you each of our commanders along our line from richmond to corinth supposes himself to be confronted by numbers superior to his own
under this pressure we thinned the line on the upper potomac
until yesterday it was broken with heavy loss to us
and general banks put in great peril
out of which he is not yet extricated
and may be actually captured
we need men to repair this breach

major general mcdowell
general fremont has been ordered by telegraph to move from franklin on harrisonburg to relieve general banks
and capture or destroy jackson's and ewell's forces
you are instructed
laying aside for the present the movement on richmond
to put 20
000 men in motion at once for the shenandoah
moving on the line or in advance of the line of the manassas gap railroad
your object will be to capture the forces of jackson and ewell
either in co operation with general fremont
in case want of supplies or of transportation
interferes with his movements
it is believed that the force which you move will be sufficient to accomplish this object alone
the information thus far received here makes it probable that if the enemy operate actively against general banks
you will not be able to count upon much assistance from him
but may even have to release him
reports received this moment are that banks is fighting with ewell eight miles from winchester

the enemy is moving north in sufficient force to drive general banks before him precisely in what force we cannot tell
he is also threatening leesburg and geary
on the manassas gap railroad
from both north and south in precisely what force we cannot tell
i think the movement is a general and concerted one
such as would not be if he was acting upon the purpose of a very desperate defense of richmond
i think the time is near when you must either attack richmond or give up the job and come to the defense of washington

it now appears that banks got safely into winchester last night

this justifies the inference that he is pressed by numbers superior to his own

your despatch received
general banks was at strasburg
with about 6
000 men
shields having been taken from him to swell a column for mcdowell to aid you at richmond
and the rest of his force scattered at various places
on the 23d a rebel force of 7000 to 10
000 fell upon one regiment and two companies guarding the bridge at front royal
destroying it entirely crossed the shenandoah
and on the 24th yesterday pushed to get north of banks
on the road to winchester
banks ran a race with them
beating them into winchester yesterday evening
this morning a battle ensued between the two forces
in which banks was beaten back into full retreat toward martinsburg
and probably is broken up into a total rout
on the manassas gap railroad
just now reports that jackson is now near front royal
with 10
following up and supporting
as i understand
the forces now pursuing banks
also that another force of 10
000 is near orleans
following on in the same direction
stripped here
as we are here
it will be all we can do to prevent them crossing the potomac at harper's ferry or above
we have about 20
000 of mcdowell's force moving back to the vicinity of front royal
and general fremont
who was at franklin
is moving to harrisonburg both these movements intended to get in the enemy's rear
one more of mcdowell's brigades is ordered through here to harper's ferry the rest of his force remains for the present at fredericksburg
we are sending such regiments and dribs from here and baltimore as we can spare to harper's ferry
supplying their places in some sort by calling in militia from the adjacent states
we also have eighteen cannon on the road to harper's ferry
of which arm there is not a single one yet at that point
this is now our situation
if mcdowell's force was now beyond our reach
we should be utterly helpless
apprehension of something like this
and no unwillingness to sustain you
has always been my reason for withholding mcdowell's force from you
please understand this
and do the best you can with the force you have
history of conspiracy of rebellion message to congress
may 16
1862 to the senate and house of representatives
the insurrection which is yet existing in the united states and aims at the overthrow of the federal constitution and the union
was clandestinely prepared during the winter of 1860 and 1861
and assumed an open organization in the form of a treasonable provisional government at montgomery
in alabama on the 18th day of february
on the 12th day of april
the insurgents committed the flagrant act of civil war by the bombardment and the capture of fort sumter
which cut off the hope of immediate conciliation
immediately afterward all the roads and avenues to this city were obstructed
and the capital was put into the condition of a siege
the mails in every direction were stopped and the lines of telegraph cut off by the insurgents
and military and naval forces which had been called out by the government for the defense of washington were prevented from reaching the city by organized and combined treasonable resistance in the state of maryland
there was no adequate and effective organization for the public defense
congress had indefinitely adjourned
there was no time to convene them
it became necessary for me to choose whether
using only the existing means
and processes which congress had provided
i should let the government fall at once into ruin or whether
availing myself of the broader powers conferred by the constitution in cases of insurrection
i would make an effort to save it
with all its blessings
for the present age and for posterity
i thereupon summoned my constitutional advisers
the heads of all the departments
to meet on sunday
the 20th day of april
at the office of the navy department
and then and there
with their unanimous concurrence
i directed that an armed revenue cutter should proceed to sea to afford protection to the commercial marine
and especially the california treasure ships then on their way to this coast
i also directed the commandant of the navy yard at boston to purchase or charter and arm as quickly as possible five steamships for purposes of public defense
i directed the commandant of the navy yard at philadelphia to purchase or charter and arm an equal number for the same purpose
i directed the commandant at new york to purchase or charter and arm an equal number
i directed commander gillis to purchase or charter and arm and put to sea two other vessels
similar directions were given to commodore dupont
with a view to the opening of passages by water to and from the capital
i directed the several officers to take the advice and obtain the aid and efficient services
in the matter
of his excellency edwin d
the governor of new york
or in his absence george d
william m
and moses h
who were by my directions especially empowered by the secretary of the navy to act for his department in that crisis in matters pertaining to the forwarding of troops and supplies for the public defense
the several departments of the government at that time contained so large a number of disloyal persons that it would have been impossible to provide safely through official agents only for the performance of the duties thus confided to citizens favorably known for their ability
and patriotism
the several orders issued upon these occurrences were transmitted by private messengers
who pursued a circuitous way to the seaboard cities
inland across the states of pennsylvania and ohio and the northern lakes
i believe by these and other similar measures taken in that crisis
some of which were without any authority of law
the government was saved from overthrow
i am not aware that a dollar of the public funds thus confided without authority of law to unofficial persons was either lost or wasted
although apprehensions of such misdirection occurred to me as objections to those extraordinary proceedings
and were necessarily overruled
i recall these transactions now because my attention has been directed to a resolution which was passed by the house of representatives on the 30th day of last month
which is in these words
that simon cameron
late secretary of war by investing alexander cummings with the control of large sums of the public money and authority to purchase military supplies without restriction
without requiring from him any guaranty for the faithful performance of his duties
when the services of competent public officers were available
and by involving the government in a vast number of contracts with persons not legitimately engaged in the business pertaining to the subject matter of such contracts
especially in the purchase of arms for future delivery
has adopted a policy highly injurious to the public service
and deserves the censure of the house
congress will see that i should be wanting equally in candor and in justice if i should leave the censure expressed in this resolution to rest exclusively or chiefly upon mr
the same sentiment is unanimously entertained by the heads of department who participated in the proceedings which the house of representatives have censured
it is due to mr
cameron to say that although he fully approved the proceedings they were not moved nor suggested by himself
and that not only the president
but all the other heads of departments
were at least equally responsible with him for whatever error
or fault was committed in the premises

which i respectfully ask for it at your hands
to general j
washington june 13
1862 major general fremont
we cannot afford to keep your force and banks's and mcdowell's engaged in keeping jackson south of strasburg and front royal
you fought jackson alone and worsted him
he can have no substantial reinforcements so long as a battle is pending at richmond
surely you and banks in supporting distance are capable of keeping him from returning to winchester
but if sigel be sent forward to you
and mcdowell as he must be put to other work
jackson will break through at front royal again
he is already on the right side of the shenandoah to do it
and on the wrong side of it to attack you
the orders already sent you and banks place you and him in the proper positions for the work assigned you
jackson cannot move his whole force on either of you before the other can learn of it and go to his assistance
he cannot divide his force
sending part against each of you
because he will be too weak for either
please do as i directed in the order of the 8th and my despatch of yesterday
the 12th
and neither you nor banks will be overwhelmed by jackson
by proper scout lookouts
and beacons of smoke by day and fires by night you can always have timely notice of the enemy's approach
i know not as to you
but by some this has been too much neglected
to general j
fremont war department
washington city
june 15
major general fremont
my dear sir
your letter of the 12th by colonel zagonyi is just received
in answer to the principal part of it
i repeat the substance of an order of the 8th and one or two telegraphic despatches sent you since
we have no definite power of sending reinforcements so that we are compelled rather to consider the proper disposal of the forces we have than of those we could wish to have
we may be able to send you some dribs by degrees
but i do not believe we can do more
as you alone beat jackson last sunday
i argue that you are stronger than he is to day
unless he has been reinforced and that he cannot have been materially reinforced
because such reinforcement could only have come from richmond
and he is much more likely to go to richmond than richmond is to come to him
neither is very likely
i think jackson's game his assigned work now is to magnify the accounts of his numbers and reports of his movements
and thus by constant alarms keep three or four times as many of our troops away from richmond as his own force amounts to
thus he helps his friends at richmond three or four times as much as if he were there
our game is not to allow this
by the order of the 8th
i directed you to halt at harrisonburg
rest your force
and get it well in hand
the objects being to guard against jackson's returning by the same route to the upper potomac over which you have just driven him out
and at the same time give some protection against a raid into west virginia
already i have given you discretion to occupy mount jackson instead
on full consideration
you think best
i do not believe jackson will attack you
but certainly he cannot attack you by surprise and if he comes upon you in superior force
you have but to notify us
fall back cautiously
and banks will join you in due time
but while we know not whether jackson will move at all
or by what route
we cannot safely put you and banks both on the strasburg line
and leave no force on the front royal line the very line upon which he prosecuted his late raid
the true policy is to place one of you on one line and the other on the other in such positions that you can unite once you actually find jackson moving upon it
and this is precisely what we are doing
this protects that part of our frontier
so to speak
and liberates mcdowell to go to the assistance of mcclellan
i have arranged this
and am very unwilling to have it deranged
while you have only asked for sigel
i have spoken only of banks
and this because sigel's force is now the principal part of bank's force
about transferring general schenck's commands
the purchase of supplies
and the promotion and appointment of officers
mentioned in your letter
i will consult with the secretary of war to morrow
yours truly

i am ready to come to a fair settlement of accounts with you on the fulfilment of understandings
early in march last
when i assigned you to the command of the mountain department
i did tell you i would give you all the force i could
and that i hoped to make it reach 35
you at the same time told me that within a reasonable time you would seize the railroad at or east of knoxville
if you could
there was then in the department a force supposed to be 25
the exact number as well known to you as to me
after looking about two or three days
you called and distinctly told me that if i would add the blenker division to the force already in the department
you would undertake the job
the blenker division contained 10
and at the expense of great dissatisfaction to general mcclellan i took it from his army and gave it to you
my promise was literally fulfilled
i have given you all i could
and i have given you very nearly
if not quite
now for yours
on the 23d of may
largely over two months afterward
you were at franklin
not within 300 miles of knoxville
nor within 80 miles of any part of the railroad east of it
and not moving forward
but telegraphing here that you could not move for lack of everything
do not misunderstand me
i do not say you have not done all you could
i presume you met unexpected difficulties and i beg you to believe that as surely as you have done your best
so have i
i have not the power now to fill up your corps to 35
i am not demanding of you to do the work of 35
i am only asking of you to stand cautiously on the defensive
get your force in order
and give such protection as you can to the valley of the shenandoah and to western virginia
have you received the orders
and will you act upon them

mount jackson
your long letter is received
the information you give is valuable
you say it is fortunate that fremont did not intercept jackson that jackson had the superior force
and would have overwhelmed him
if this is so
how happened it that fremont fairly fought and routed him on the 8th
or is the account that he did fight and rout him false and fabricated
both general fremont and you speak of jackson having beaten shields
by our accounts he did not beat shields
he had no engagement with shields
he did meet and drive back with disaster about 2000 of shields's advance till they were met by an additional brigade of shields's
when jackson himself turned and retreated
shields himself and more than half his force were not nearer than twenty miles to any of it

met 10
000 to 15
000 passing through the latter place to join jackson

treaty with mexico message to the senate
june 23
to the senate of the united states
on the 7th day of december
i submitted to the senate the project of a treaty between the united states and mexico which had been proposed to me by mr
our minister to mexico
and respectfully requested the advice of the senate thereupon
on the 25th day of february last a resolution was adopted by the senate to the effect
that it is not advisable to negotiate a treaty that will require the united states to assume any portion of the principal or interest of the debt of mexico
or that will require the concurrence of european powers
this resolution having been duly communicated to me
notice thereof was immediately given by the secretary of state to mr
and he was informed that he was to consider his instructions upon the subject referred to modified by this resolution and would govern his course accordingly
that despatch failed to reach mr
by reason of the disturbed condition of mexico
until a very recent date
corwin being without instructions
or thus practically left without instructions
to negotiate further with mexico
in view of the very important events occurring there
he has thought that the interests of the united states would be promoted by the conclusion of two treaties which should provide for a loan to that republic
he has therefore signed such treaties
and they having been duly ratified by the government of mexico
he has transmitted them to me for my consideration
the action of the senate is of course conclusive against an acceptance of the treaties on my part
i have
thought it just to our excellent minister in mexico and respectful to the government of that republic to lay the treaties before the senate
together with the correspondence which has occurred in relation to them
in performing this duty i have only to add that the importance of the subject thus submitted to the senate
can not be over estimated
and i shall cheerfully receive and consider with the highest respect any further advice the senate may think proper to give upon the subject
veto of a currency bill message to the senate
june 23
to the senate of the united states
the bill which has passed the house of representatives and the senate
entitled an act to repeal that part of an act of congress which prohibits the circulation of bank notes of a less denomination than five dollars in the district of columbia
has received my attentive consideration
and i now return it to the senate
in which it originated
with the following objections
the bill proposes to repeal the existing legislation prohibiting the circulation of bank notes of a less denomination than five dollars within the district of columbia
without permitting the issuing of such bills by banks not now legally authorized to issue them
in my judgment
it will be found impracticable
in the present condition of the currency
to make such a discrimination
the banks have generally suspended specie payments
and a legal sanction given to the circulation of the irredeemable notes of one class of them will almost certainly be so extended
in practical operation
as to include those of all classes
whether authorized or unauthorized
if this view be correct
the currency of the district
should this act become a law
will certainly and greatly deteriorate
to the serious injury of honest trade and honest labor
this bill seems to contemplate no end which cannot be otherwise more certainly and beneficially attained
during the existing war it is peculiarly the duty of the national government to secure to the people a sound circulating medium
this duty has been
under existing circumstances
satisfactorily performed
in part at least
by authorizing the issue of united states notes
receivable for all government dues except customs
and made a legal tender for all debts
public and private
except interest on public debt
the object of the bill submitted to me namely
that of providing a small note currency during the present suspension can be fully accomplished by authorizing the issue
as part of any new emission of united states notes made necessary by the circumstances of the country
of notes of a similar character
but of less denomination than five dollars
such an issue would answer all the beneficial purposes of the bill
would save a considerable amount to the treasury in interest
would greatly facilitate payments to soldiers and other creditors of small sums
and would furnish to the people a currency as safe as their own government
entertaining these objections to the bill
i feel myself constrained to withhold from it my approval and return it for the further consideration and action of congress

the enemy have concentrated in such force at richmond as to render it absolutely necessary
in the opinion of the president
for you immediately to detach 25
000 of your force and forward it by the nearest and quickest route by way of baltimore and washington to richmond
it is believed that the quickest route would be by way of columbus
and up the ohio river
but in detaching your force the president directs that it be done in such a way as to enable you to hold your ground and not interfere with the movement against chattanooga and east tennessee
this condition being observed
the forces to be detached and the routes they are to be sent are left to your own judgment
the direction to send these forces immediately is rendered imperative by a serious reverse suffered by general mcclellan before richmond yesterday
the full extent of which is not yet known
you will acknowledge the receipt of this despatch
stating the day and hour it is received
and inform me what your action will be

lincoln to secretary seward

june 28
1862 hon
my dear sir
my view of the present condition of the war is about as follows
the evacuation of corinth and our delay by the flood in the chickahominy have enabled the enemy to concentrate too much force in richmond for mcclellan to successfully attack
in fact there soon will be no substantial rebel force anywhere else
but if we send all the force from here to mcclellan
the enemy will
before we can know of it
send a force from richmond and take washington
or if a large part of the western army be brought here to mcclellan
they will let us have richmond
and retake tennessee
what should be done is to hold what we have in the west
open the mississippi
and take chattanooga and east tennessee without more
a reasonable force should in every event be kept about washington for its protection
then let the country give us a hundred thousand new troops in the shortest possible time
added to mcclellan directly or indirectly
will take richmond without endangering any other place which we now hold
and will substantially end the war
i expect to maintain this contest until successful
or till i die
or am conquered
or my term expires
or congress or the country forsake me and i would publicly appeal to the country for this new force were it not that i fear a general panic and stampede would follow
so hard it is to have a thing understood as it really is
i think the new force should be all
or nearly all
principally because such can be raised most cheaply and quickly

astor house

not much more than when you left
fulton of baltimore american is now with us
he left white house at 11 a
he conversed fully with a paymaster who was with porter's force during the fight of friday and fell back to nearer mcclellan's quarters just a little sooner than porter did
seeing the whole of it stayed on the richmond side of the chickahominy over night
and left for white house at 5 a
he says porter retired in perfect order under protection of the guns arranged for the purpose
under orders and not from necessity and with all other of our forces
except what was left on purpose to go to white house
was safely in pontoons over the chickahominy before morning
and that there was heavy firing on the richmond side
begun at 5 and ceased at 7 a
on the whole
i think we have had the better of it up to that point of time
what has happened since we still know not
as we have no communication with general mcclellan
a despatch from colonel ingalls shows that he thinks mcclellan is fighting with the enemy at richmond to day
and will be to morrow
we have no means of knowing upon what colonel ingalls founds his opinion
confirmed about saving all property
not a single unwounded straggler came back to white house from the field
and the number of wounded reaching there up to 11 a
saturday was not large
to what the president has above stated i will only add one or two points that may be satisfactory for you to know
all the sick and wounded were safely removed second
a despatch from burnside shows that he is from white house not a man left behind in condition to afford efficient support
and is probably doing so
the despatch from colonel ingalls impresses me with the conviction that the movement was made by general mcclellan to concentrate on richmond
and was successful to the latest point of which we have any information
fulton says that on friday night
between twelve and one o'clock
general mcclellan telegraphed commodore goldsborough that the result of the movement was satisfactory to him
from these and the facts stated by the president
my inference is that general mcclellan will probably be in richmond within two days
edwin m
secretary of war
unfortunately mcclellan did not do any of the things he was ordered
and that it was very likely possible to do
it is still some mystery what he was doing all these days other than hiding in the woods and staying out of communication so he would not receive any more uncomfortable orders
this was another place where the north was close to wining the war and did not

we are yet without communication with general mcclellan
and this absence of news is our point of anxiety
up to the latest point to which we are posted he effected everything in such exact accordance with his plan
contingently announced to us before the battle began
that we feel justified to hope that he has not failed since
he had a severe engagement in getting the part of his army on this side of the chickahominy over to the other side
in which the enemy lost certainly as much as we did
we are not dissatisfied with this
only that the loss of enemies does not compensate for the loss of friends
the enemy cannot come below white house certainly is not there now
and probably has abandoned the whole line

to the governors of the several states
the capture of new orleans
and corinth by the national forces has enabled the insurgents to concentrate a large force at and about richmond
which place we must take with the least possible delay in fact
there will soon be no formidable insurgent force except at richmond
with so large an army there
the enemy can threaten us on the potomac and elsewhere
until we have re established the national authority
all these places must be held
and we must keep a respectable force in front of washington
but this
from the diminished strength of our army by sickness and casualties
renders an addition to it necessary in order to close the struggle which has been prosecuted for the last three months with energy and success
rather than hazard the misapprehension of our military condition and of groundless alarm by a call for troops by proclamation
i have deemed it best to address you in this form
to accomplish the object stated we require without delay 150
000 men
including those recently called for by the secretary of war

your telegram of this date just received
the chattanooga expedition must not on any account be given up
the president regards that and the movement against east tennessee as one of the most important movements of the war
and its occupation nearly as important as the capture of richmond
he is not pleased with the tardiness of the movement toward chattanooga
and directs that no force be sent here if you cannot do it without breaking up the operations against that point and east tennessee
infantry only are needed our cavalry and artillery are strong enough
the first reports from richmond were more discouraging than the truth warranted
if the advantage is not on our side
it is balanced
general mcclellan has moved his whole force on the line of the james river
and is supported there by our gunboats but he must be largely strengthened before advancing
and hence the call on you
which i am glad you answered so promptly

in view of the present state of the important military movements now in progress

that you at once call upon the several states for such number of men as may be required to fill up all military organizations now in the field
and add to the armies heretofore organized such additional number of men as may
in your judgment
be necessary to garrison and hold all the numerous cities and military positions that have been captured by our armies
and to speedily crush the rebellion that still exists in several of the southern states
thus practically restoring to the civilized world our great and good government
all believe that the decisive moment is near at hand
and to that end the people of the united states are desirous to aid promptly in furnishing all reinforcements that you may deem needful to sustain our government

we then learned that you had requested him to go to goldsborough upon which we said to him our order was intended for your benefit
and we did not wish to be in conflict with your views
we hope you will have help from him soon
today we have ordered general hunter to send you all he can spare
at last advices general halleck thinks he cannot send reinforcements without endangering all he has gained

major general mcclellan
i understand your position as stated in your letter and by general marcy
to reinforce you so as to enable you to resume the offensive within a month
or even six weeks
is impossible
in addition to that arrived and now arriving from the potomac about 10
000 men
i suppose
and about 10
000 i hope you will have from burnside very soon
and about 5000 from hunter a little later
i do not see how i can send you another man within a month
under these circumstances the defensive for the present must be your only care
save the army first
where you are
if you can secondly
by removal
if you must
on the ground
must be the judge as to which you will attempt
and of the means for effecting it
i but give it as my opinion that with the aid of the gunboats and the reinforcements mentioned above you can hold your present position provided
and so long as
you can keep the james river open below you
if you are not tolerably confident you can keep the james river open
you had better remove as soon as possible
i do not remember that you have expressed any apprehension as to the danger of having your communication cut on the river below you
yet i do not suppose it can have escaped your attention
yours very truly
if at any time you feel able to take the offensive
you are not restrained from doing so

this introduces governor william sprague

he is now governor for the third time

he has my cheerful consent to go
but not my direction
he wishes to get you and part of your force
one or both
to come here
you already know i should be exceedingly glad of this if
in your judgment
it could be without endangering positions and operations in the southwest and i now repeat what i have more than once said by telegraph
do not come or send a man if
in your judgment
it will endanger any point you deem important to hold
or endangers or delays the chattanooga expedition
still
please give my friend

but think camp is getting worse
general porter
very good
general franklin
not good
the president
where is the enemy now
general mcclellan
from four to five miles from us on all the roads i think nearly the whole army both hills
the president
to the corps commanders where and in what condition do you believe the enemy to be now
general sumner
i think they have retired from our front were very much damaged
especially in their best troops
in the late actions
from superiority of arms
general heintzelman
don't think they are in force in our vicinity
general keyes
think he has withdrawn
and think preparing to go to washington
general porter
believe he is mainly near richmond
he feels he dare not attack us here
general franklin
i learn he has withdrawn from our front and think that is probable
the president
to the corps commanders what is the aggregate of your killed
and missing from the attack on the 26th ultimo till now
general sumner

not large 745
general keyes
less than 500

if you desired could you remove the army safely
general mcclellan
it would be a delicate and very difficult matter
the president
to the corps commanders if it were desired to get the army away
could it be safely effected
general sumner
i think we could
but i think we give up the cause if we do
general heintzelman
perhaps we could
but i think it would be ruinous to the country
general keyes
i think it could if done quickly
general porter
impossible move the army and ruin the country
general franklin
i think we could
and that we had better think rappahannock the true line
the president
to the corps commanders is the army secure in its present position
general sumner
perfectly so
in my judgment
general heintzelman
i think it is safe
general keyes
with help of general b
burnside can hold position
general porter
perfectly so
not only
but we are ready to begin moving forward

lincoln order concerning the southwest branch of the pacific railroad
in the judgment of the president
the public safety does require that the railroad line called and known as the southwest branch of the pacific railroad in the state of missouri be repaired
and completed from rolla to lebanon
in the direction to springfield
in the said state
the same being necessary to the successful and economical conduct of the war and to the maintenance of the authority of the government in the southwest
under and in virtue of the act of congress entitled an act to authorize the president of the united states in certain cases to take possession of railroad and telegraph lines
and for other purposes
approved january 31
it is ordered
that the portion of the said railroad line which reaches from rolla to lebanon be repaired
and completed
so as to be made available for the military uses of the government
as speedily as may be
inasmuch as upon the part of the said line from rolla to the stream called little piney a considerable portion of the necessary work has already been done by the railroad company
and the road to this extent may be completed at comparatively small cost
it is ordered that the said line from rolla to and across little piney be first completed
and as soon as possible
the secretary of war is charged with the execution of this order
and to facilitate the speedy execution of the work
he is directed
at his discretion
to take possession and control of the whole or such part of the said railroad line
and the whole or such part of the rolling stock
and all their appendages and appurtenances
as he may judge necessary or convenient for the early completion of the road from rolla to lebanon
done at the city of washington

appeal to border states in favor of compensated emancipation
july 12
after the adjournment of congress now very near
i shall have no opportunity of seeing you for several months
believing that you of the border states hold more power for good than any other equal number of members
i feel it a duty which i cannot justifiably waive to make this appeal to you
i intend no reproach or complaint when i assure you that
in my opinion
if you all had voted for the resolution in the gradual emancipation message of last march
the war would now be substantially ended
and the plan therein proposed is yet one of the most potent and swift means of ending it
let the states which are in rebellion see definitely and certainly that in no event will the states you represent ever join their proposed confederacy
and they cannot much longer maintain the contest
but you cannot divest them of their hope to ultimately have you with them so long as you show a determination to perpetuate the institution within your own states
beat them at elections
as you have overwhelmingly done
nothing daunted
they still claim you as their own
you and i know what the lever of their power is
break that lever before their faces
and they can shake you no more forever
most of you have treated me with kindness and consideration and i trust you will not now think i improperly touch what is exclusively your own
for the sake of the whole country
i ask
can you
for your states
do better than to take the course i urge
discarding punctilio and maxims adapted to more manageable times
and looking only to the unprecedentedly stern facts of our case
can you do better in any possible event
you prefer that the constitutional relation of the states to the nation shall be practically restored without disturbance of the institution and if this were done
my whole duty in this respect
under the constitution and my oath of office
would be performed
but it is not done
and we are trying to accomplish it by war
the incidents of the war cannot be avoided
if the war continues long
as it must if the object be not sooner attained
the institution in your states will be extinguished by mere friction and abrasion by the mere incidents of the war
it will be gone
and you will have nothing valuable in lieu of it
much of its value is gone already
how much better for you and for your people to take the step which at once shortens the war and secures substantial compensation for that which is sure to be wholly lost in any other event
how much better to thus save the money which else we sink forever in war
how much better to do it while we can
lest the war ere long render us pecuniarily unable to do it
how much better for you as seller
and the nation as buyer
to sell out and buy out that without which the war could never have been
than to sink both the thing to be sold and the price of it in cutting one another's throats
i do not speak of emancipation at once
but of a decision at once to emancipate gradually
room in south america for colonization can be obtained cheaply and in abundance
and when numbers shall be large enough to be company and encouragement for one another
the freed people will not be so reluctant to go
i am pressed with a difficulty not yet mentioned one which threatens division among those who
are none too strong
an instance of it is known to you
general hunter is an honest man
he was
and i hope still is
my friend
i valued him none the less for his agreeing with me in the general wish that all men everywhere could be free
he proclaimed all men free within certain states
and i repudiated the proclamation
he expected more good and less harm from the measure than i could believe would follow
in repudiating it
i gave dissatisfaction
if not offence
to many whose support the country cannot afford to lose
and this is not the end of it
the pressure in this direction is still upon me
and is increasing
by conceding what i now ask you can relieve me
much more
can relieve the country in this important point
upon these considerations
i have again begged your attention to the message of march last
before leaving the capital
consider and discuss it among yourselves
you are patriots and statesmen
and as such i pray you consider this proposition and
at the least
commend it to the consideration of your states and people
as you would perpetuate popular government for the best people in the world
i beseech you that you do in nowise omit this
our common country is in great peril
demanding the loftiest views and boldest action to bring a speedy relief
once relieved
its form of government is saved to the world its beloved history and cherished memories are vindicated
and its happy future fully assured and rendered inconceivably grand
to you
more than to any others
the privilege is given to assure that happiness and swell that grandeur
and to link your own names therewith forever

act of compensated emancipation message to congress
july 4
fellow citizens of the senate and house of representatives
herewith is the draft of the bill to compensate any state which may abolish slavery within its limits
the passage of which
substantially as presented
i respectfully and earnestly recommend
be it enacted by the senate and house of representatives of the united states of america in congress assembled
that whenever the president of the united states shall be satisfied that any state shall have lawfully abolished slavery within and through out such state
either immediately or gradually
it shall be the duty of the president
assisted by the secretary of the treasury
to prepare and deliver to each state an amount of six per cent
interest bearing bonds of the united states equal to the aggregate value at dollars per head of all the slaves within such state
as reported by the census of 1860 the whole amount for any one state to be delivered at once if the abolishment be immediate
or in equal annual instalments if it be gradual
interest to begin running on each bond at the time of delivery
and not before
and be it further enacted
that if any state
having so received any such bonds
shall at any time afterwards by law reintroduce or tolerate slavery within its limits
contrary to the act of abolishment upon which such bonds shall have been received
said bonds so received by said state shall at once be null and void
in whosesoever hands they may be
and such state shall refund to the united states all interest which may have been paid on such bonds

message to congress
july 17
fellow citizens of the senate and house of representatives
considering the bill for an act to suppress insurrection
to punish treason and rebellion
to seize and confiscate the property of rebels
and for other purposes
and the joint resolution explanatory of said act as being substantially one
i have approved and signed both
before i was informed of the passage of the resolution i had prepared the draft of a message stating objections to the bill becoming a law
a copy of which draft is herewith transmitted
fellow citizens of the house of representatives
i herewith return to your honorable body
in which it originated
the bill for an act entitled an act to suppress treason and rebellion
to seize and confiscate the property of rebels
and for other purposes
together with my objections to its becoming a law
there is much in the bill to which i perceive no objection
it is wholly prospective
and touches neither person nor property of any loyal citizen
in which particulars it is just and proper
the first and second sections provide for the conviction and punishment of persons who shall be guilty of treason and persons who shall incite
set on foot
or engage in any rebellion or insurrection against the authority of the united states or the laws thereof
or shall give aid and comfort thereto
or shall engage in or give aid and comfort to any such existing rebellion or insurrection
by fair construction persons within these sections are not to be punished without regular trials in duly constituted courts
under the forms and all the substantial provisions of law and of the constitution applicable to their several cases
to this i perceive no objection
especially as such persons would be within the general pardoning power and also the special provision for pardon and amnesty contained in this act
it is also provided that the slaves of persons convicted under these sections shall be free
i think there is an unfortunate form of expression rather than a substantial objection in this
it is startling to say that congress can free a slave within a state
and yet if it were said the ownership of the slave had first been transferred to the nation and that congress had then liberated him the difficulty would at once vanish
and this is the real case
the traitor against the general government forfeits his slave at least as justly as he does any other property
and he forfeits both to the government against which be offends
the government
so far as there can be ownership
thus owns the forfeited slaves
and the question for congress in regard to them is
shall they be made free or be sold to new masters
i perceive no objection to congress deciding in advance that they shall be free
to the high honor of kentucky
as i am informed
she is the owner of some slaves by escheat
and has sold none
but liberated all
i hope the same is true of some other states
i do not believe it will be physically possible for the general government to return persons so circumstanced to actual slavery
i believe there would be physical resistance to it which could neither be turned aside by argument nor driven away by force
in this view i have no objection to this feature of the bill
another matter involved in these two sections
and running through other parts of the act
will be noticed hereafter
i perceive no objection to the third or fourth sections
so far as i wish to notice the fifth and sixth sections
they may be considered together
that the enforcement of these sections would do no injustice to the persons embraced within them
is clear
that those who make a causeless war should be compelled to pay the cost of it
is too obviously just to be called in question
to give governmental protection to the property of persons who have abandoned it
and gone on a crusade to overthrow the same government
is absurd
if considered in the mere light of justice
the severest justice may not always be the best policy
the principle of seizing and appropriating the property of the persons embraced within these sections is certainly not very objectionable
but a justly discriminating application of it would be very difficult and
to a great extent
and would it not be wise to place a power of remission somewhere
so that these persons may know they have something to lose by persisting and something to gain by desisting
a man without hope is a most dangerous man he has nothing to lose
i am not sure whether such power of remission is or is not in section thirteen
without any special act of congress
i think our military commanders
when in military phrase
they are within the enemy's country
should
in an orderly manner
seize and use whatever of real or personal property may be necessary or convenient for their commands at the same time preserving
in some way
the evidence of what they do
what i have said in regard to slaves
while commenting on the first and second sections
is applicable to the ninth
with the difference that no provision is made in the whole act for determining whether a particular individual slave does or does not fall within the classes defined in that section
he is to be free upon certain conditions but whether those conditions do or do not pertain to him no mode of ascertaining is provided
this could be easily supplied
to the tenth section i make no objection
the oath therein required seems to be proper
and the remainder of the section is substantially identical with a law already existing
the eleventh section simply assumes to confer discretionary power upon the executive
without the law
i have no hesitation to go as far in the direction indicated as i may at any time deem expedient
and i am ready to say now i think it is proper for our military commanders to employ
as laborers
as many persons of african descent as can be used to advantage
the twelfth and thirteenth sections are something better than unobjectionable and the fourteenth is entirely proper
if all other parts of the act shall stand
that to which i chiefly object pervades most parts of the act
but more distinctly appears in the first
and eighth sections
it is the sum of those provisions which results in the divesting of title forever
for the causes of treason and ingredients of treason
not amounting to the full crime
it declares forfeiture extending beyond the lives of the guilty parties whereas the constitution of the united states declares that no attainder of treason shall work corruption of blood or forfeiture except during the life of the person attainted
true
there is to be no formal attainder in this case still
i think the greater punishment cannot be constitutionally inflicted
in a different form
for the same offence
with great respect i am constrained to say i think this feature of the act is unconstitutional
it would not be difficult to modify it
i may remark that the provision of the constitution
put in language borrowed from great britain
applies only in this country
as i understand
to real or landed estate
this act in rem forfeits property for the ingredients of treason without a conviction of the supposed criminal
or a personal hearing given him in any proceeding
that we may not touch property lying within our reach
because we cannot give personal notice to an owner who is absent endeavoring to destroy the government
is certainly not satisfactory
the owner may not be thus engaged and i think a reasonable time should be provided for such parties to appear and have personal hearings
similar provisions are not uncommon in connection with proceedings in rem
for the reasons stated
i return the bill to the house in which it originated

order in regard to behavior of aliens war department
adjutant general's office
july 21
the following order has been received from the president of the united states
representations have been made to the president by the ministers of various foreign powers in amity with the united states that subjects of such powers have during the present insurrection been obliged or required by military authorities to take an oath of general or qualified allegiance to this government
it is the duty of all aliens residing in the united states to submit to and obey the laws and respect the authority of the government
for any proceeding or conduct inconsistent with this obligation and subversive of that authority they may rightfully be subjected to military restraints when this may be necessary
but they cannot be required to take an oath of allegiance to this government
because it conflicts with the duty they owe to their own sovereigns
all such obligations heretofore taken are therefore remitted and annulled
military commanders will abstain from imposing similar obligations in future
and will in lieu thereof adopt such other restraints of the character indicated as they shall find necessary
and effectual for the public safety
it is further directed that whenever any order shall be made affecting the personal liberty of an alien reports of the same and of the causes thereof shall be made to the war department for the consideration of the department of state
by order of the secretary of war
order authorizing employment of contrabands

that military commanders within the states of virginia

none shall be destroyed in wantonness or malice
that military and naval commanders shall employ as laborers within and from said states so many persons of african descent as can be advantageously used for military or naval purposes
giving them reasonable wages for their labor
that as to both property and persons of african descent accounts shall be kept sufficiently accurate and in detail to show quantities and amounts and from whom both property and such persons shall have come
as a basis upon which compensation can be made in proper cases and the several departments of this government shall attend to and perform their appropriate parts toward the execution of these orders

reverdy johnson
my dear sir
yours of the 16th is received
you are ready to say i apply to friends what is due only to enemies
i distrust the wisdom if not the sincerity of friends who would hold my hands while my enemies stab me
this appeal of professed friends has paralyzed me more in this struggle than any other one thing
you remember telling me
the day after the baltimore mob in april
that it would crush all union feeling in maryland for me to attempt bringing troops over maryland soil to washington
i brought the troops notwithstanding
and yet there was union feeling enough left to elect a legislature the next autumn
which in turn elected a very excellent union united states senator
i am a patient man always willing to forgive on the christian terms of repentance
and also to give ample time for repentance
i must save this government
if possible
what i cannot do
of course
i will not do but it may as well be understood
once for all
that i shall not surrender this game leaving any available card unplayed
yours truly
to cuthbert bullitt
washington
july 28
cuthbert bullitt
new orleans
the copy of a letter addressed to yourself by mr
thomas j
durant has been shown to me
the writer appears to be an able
a dispassionate
and an entirely sincere man
the first part of the letter is devoted to an effort to show that the secession ordinance of louisiana was adopted against the will of a majority of the people
this is probably true
and in that fact may be found some instruction
why did they allow the ordinance to go into effect
why did they not assert themselves
why stand passive and allow themselves to be trodden down by minority
why did they not hold popular meetings and have a convention of their own to express and enforce the true sentiment of the state
if preorganization was against them then
why not do this now that the united states army is present to protect them
the paralysis the dead palsy of the government in this whole struggle is that this class of men will do nothing for the government
nothing for themselves
except demanding that the government shall not strike its open enemies
lest they be struck by accident
durant complains that in various ways the relation of master and slave is disturbed by the presence of our army
and he considers it particularly vexatious that this
in part
is done under cover of an act of congress
while constitutional guaranties are suspended on the plea of military necessity
the truth is
that what is done and omitted about slaves is done and omitted on the same military necessity
it is a military necessity to have men and money and we can get neither in sufficient numbers or amounts if we keep from or drive from our lines slaves coming to them
durant cannot be ignorant of the pressure in this direction
nor of my efforts to hold it within bounds till he and such as he shall have time to help themselves
i am not posted to speak understandingly on all the police regulations of which mr
durant complains
if experience shows any one of them to be wrong
let them be set right
i think i can perceive in the freedom of trade which mr
durant urges that he would relieve both friends and enemies from the pressure of the blockade
by this he would serve the enemy more effectively than the enemy is able to serve himself
i do not say or believe that to serve the enemy is the purpose
of mr
or that he is conscious of any purpose other than national and patriotic ones
if there were a class of men who
having no choice of sides in the contest
were anxious only to have quiet and comfort for themselves while it rages
and to fall in with the victorious side at the end of it without loss to themselves
their advice as to the mode of conducting the contest would be precisely such as his is
he speaks of no duty apparently thinks of none resting upon union men
he even thinks it injurious to the union cause that they should be restrained in trade and passage without taking sides
they are to touch neither a sail nor a pump
but to be merely passengers deadheads at that to be carried snug and dry throughout the storm
and safely landed right side up
even a mutineer is to go untouched
lest these sacred passengers receive an accidental wound
of course the rebellion will never be suppressed in louisiana if the professed union men there will neither help to do it nor permit the government to do it without their help
i think the true remedy is very different from what is suggested by mr
it does not lie in rounding the rough angles of the war
but in removing the necessity for the war
the people of louisiana who wish protection to person and property have but to reach forth their hands and take it
let them in good faith reinaugurate the national authority
and set up a state government conforming thereto under the constitution
they know how to do it and can have the protection of the army while doing it
the army will be withdrawn so soon as such state government can dispense with its presence and the people of the state can then
upon the old constitutional terms
govern themselves to their own liking
this is very simple and easy
if they will not do this if they prefer to hazard all for the sake of destroying the government it is for them to consider whether it is probable i will surrender the government to save them from losing all
if they decline what i suggest
you scarcely need to ask what i will do
what would you do in my position
would you drop the war where it is
or would you prosecute it in future with elder stalk squirts charged with rose water
would you deal lighter blows rather than heavier ones
would you give up the contest
leaving any available means unapplied
i am in no boastful mood
i shall not do more than i can
and i shall do all i can
to save the government
which is my sworn duty as well as my personal inclination
i shall do nothing in malice
what i deal with is too vast for malicious dealing
yours truly

governors of all loyal states
it would be of great service here for us to know
as fully as you can tell
what progress is made and making in recruiting for old regiments in your state
also about what day the first regiments can move with you
what the second
what the third
and so on
this information is important to us in making calculations
please give it as promptly and accurately as you call
broken eggs cannot be mended extract from letter to august belmont
july 31
broken eggs cannot be mended but louisiana has nothing to do now but to take her place in the union as it was
barring the already broken eggs
the sooner she does so
the smaller will be the amount of that which will be past mending
this government cannot much longer play a game in which it stakes all
and its enemies stake nothing
those enemies must understand that they cannot experiment for ten years trying to destroy the government
and if they fail
still come back into the union unhurt
if they expect in any contingency to ever have the union as it was
i join with the writer in saying
now is the time
how much better it would have been for the writer to have gone at this
under the protection of the army at new orleans
than to have sat down in a closet writing complaining letters northward

dear sir your very acceptable letter
dated orbe
canton de vaud
18th of july
is received
the moral effect was the worst of the affair before richmond
and that has run its course downward
we are now at a stand
and shall soon be rising again
as we hope
i believe it is true that
in men and material
the enemy suffered more than we in that series of conflicts
while it is certain that he is less able to bear it
with us every soldier is a man of character
and must be treated with more consideration than is customary in europe
hence our great army
for slighter causes than could have prevailed there
has dwindled rapidly
bringing the necessity for a new call earlier than was anticipated
we shall easily obtain the new levy
be not alarmed if you shall learn that we shall have resorted to a draft for part of this
it seems strange even to me
but it is true
that the government is now pressed to this course by a popular demand
thousands who wish not to personally enter the service are nevertheless anxious to pay and send substitutes
provided they can have assurance that unwilling persons
similarly situated
will be compelled to do likewise
besides this
volunteers mostly choose to enter newly forming regiments
while drafted men can be sent to fill up the old ones
wherein man for man they are quite doubly as valuable
you ask
why is it that the north with her great armies so often is found with inferiority of numbers face to face with the armies of the south
while i painfully know the fact
a military man
which i am not
would better answer the question
the fact i know has not been overlooked
and i suppose the cause of its continuance lies mainly in the other facts that the enemy holds the interior and we the exterior lines
and that we operate where the people convey information to the enemy
while he operates where they convey none to us
i have received the volume and letter which you did me the honor of addressing to me
and for which please accept my sincere thanks
you are much admired in america for the ability of your writings
and much loved for your generosity to us and your devotion to liberal principles generally
you are quite right as to the importance to us
for its bearing upon europe
that we should achieve military successes
and the same is true for us at home as well as abroad
yet it seems unreasonable that a series of successes
extending through half a year
and clearing more than 100
000 square miles of country
should help us so little
while a single half defeat should hurt us so much
but let us be patient
i am very happy to know that my course has not conflicted with your judgment of propriety and policy i can only say that i have acted upon my best convictions
without selfishness or malice
and that by the help of god i shall continue to do so
please be assured of my highest respect and esteem
speech at a war meeting
august 6
1862 fellow citizens
i believe there is no precedent for my appearing before you on this occasion
but it is also true that there is no precedent for your being here yourselves
and i offer in justification of myself and of you that
upon examination
i have found nothing in the constitution against it
have an impression that there are younger gentlemen who will entertain you better and better address your understanding than i will or could
and therefore i propose but to detain you a moment longer
i am very little inclined on any occasion to say anything unless i hope to produce some good by it
the only thing i think of just now not likely to be better said by some one else is a matter in which we have heard some other persons blamed for what i did myself there has been a very widespread attempt to have a quarrel between general mcclellan and the secretary of war now
i occupy a position that enables me to believe that these two gentlemen are not nearly so deep in the quarrel as some presuming to be their friends
general mcclellan's attitude is such that in the very selfishness of his nature he cannot but wish to be successful and i hope he will and the secretary of war is precisely in the same situation
if the military commanders in the field cannot be successful
not only the secretary of war
but myself
for the time being the master of both
cannot but be failures
i know general mcclellan wishes to be successful
and i know he does not wish it any more than the secretary of war for him
and both of them together no more than i wish it
sometimes we have a dispute about how many men general mcclellan has had
and those who would disparage him say he has had a very large number
and those who would disparage the secretary of war insist that general mcclellan has had a very small number
the basis for this is
there is always a wide difference
and on this occasion perhaps a wider one
between the grand total on mcclellan's rolls and the men actually fit for duty and those who would disparage him talk of the grand total on paper
and those who would disparage the secretary of war talk of those at present fit for duty
general mcclellan has sometimes asked for things that the secretary of war did not give him
general mcclellan is not to blame for asking for what he wanted and needed
and the secretary of war is not to blame for not giving when he had none to give
and i say here
so far as i know
the secretary of war has withheld no one thing at any time in my power to give him
i have no accusation against him
i believe he is a brave and able man
and i stand here
as justice requires me to do
to take upon myself what has been charged on the secretary of war as withholding from him
i have talked longer than i expected to do
and now i avail myself of my privilege of saying no more

address on colonization to a deputation of colored men
august 14
this afternoon the president of the united states gave an audience to a committee of colored men at the white house
they were introduced by rev
commissioner of emigration
the chairman
remarked that they were there by invitation to hear what the executive had to say to them
having all been seated
the president
after a few preliminary observations
informed them that a sum of money had been appropriated by congress
and placed at his disposition
for the purpose of aiding the colonization
in some country
of the people
or a portion of them
of african descent
thereby making it his duty
as it had for a long time been his inclination
to favor that cause
and why
he asked
should the people of your race be colonized
and where
why should they leave this country
this is
the first question for proper consideration
you and we are different races
we have between us a broader difference than exists between almost any other two races
whether it is right or wrong i need not discuss but this physical difference is a great disadvantage to us both
as i think
your race suffer very greatly
many of them
by living among us
while ours suffer from your presence
in a word
we suffer on each side
if this is admitted
it affords a reason
at least
why we should be separated
you here are free men
i suppose
a voice yes
perhaps you have long been free
or all your lives
your race are suffering
in my judgment
the greatest wrong inflicted on any people
but even when you cease to be slaves
you are yet far removed from being placed on an equality with the white race
you are cut off from many of the advantages which the other race enjoys
the aspiration of men is to enjoy equality with the best when free
but on this broad continent not a single man of your race is made the equal of a single man of ours
go where you are treated the best
and the ban is still upon you
i do not propose to discuss this
but to present it as a fact
with which we have to deal
i cannot alter it if i would
it is a fact about which we all think and feel alike
i and you
we look to our condition
owing to the existence of the two races on this continent
i need not recount to you the effects upon white men
growing out of the institution of slavery
i believe in its general evil effects on the white race
see our present condition the country engaged in war white men cutting one another's throats none knowing how far it will extend and then consider what we know to be the truth
but for your race among us there could not be war
although many men engaged on either side do not care for you one way or the other
nevertheless i repeat
without the institution of slavery and the colored race as a basis
the war could not have an existence
it is better for us both
to be separated
i know that there are free men among you
even if they could better their condition
are not as much inclined to go out of the country as those who
being slaves
could obtain their freedom on this condition
i suppose one of the principal difficulties in the way of colonization is that the free colored man cannot see that his comfort would be advanced by it
you may believe that you can live in washington
or elsewhere in the united states
the remainder of your life
as easily
perhaps more so
than you can in any foreign country and hence you may come to the conclusion that you have nothing to do with the idea of going to a foreign country
this is i speak in no unkind sense an extremely selfish view of the case
you ought to do something to help those who are not so fortunate as yourselves
there is an unwillingness on the part of our people
harsh as it may be
for you free colored people to remain with us
if you could give a start to the white people
you would open a wide door for many to be made free
if we deal with those who are not free at the beginning
and whose intellects are clouded by slavery
we have very poor material to start with
if intelligent colored men
such as are before me
would move in this matter
much might be accomplished
it is exceedingly important that we have men at the beginning capable of thinking as white men
and not those who have been systematically oppressed
there is much to encourage you
for the sake of your race you should sacrifice something of your present comfort for the purpose of being as grand in that respect as the white people
it is a cheering thought throughout life that something can be done to ameliorate the condition of those who have been subject to the hard usages of the world
it is difficult to make a man miserable while he feels he is worthy of himself and claims kindred to the great god who made him
in the american revolutionary war sacrifices were made by men engaged in it
but they were cheered by the future
general washington himself endured greater physical hardships than if he had remained a british subject
yet he was a happy man because he had engaged in benefiting his race
in doing something for the children of his neighbors
having none of his own
the colony of liberia has been in existence a long time
in a certain sense it is a success
the old president of liberia
has just been with me the first time i ever saw him
he says they have within the bounds of that colony between three and four hundred thousand people
or more than in some of our old states
such as rhode island or delaware
or in some of our newer states
and less than in some of our larger ones
they are not all american colonists or their descendants
something less than 12
000 have been sent thither from this country
many of the original settlers have died yet
like people else where
their offspring outnumber those deceased
the question is
if the colored people are persuaded to go anywhere
why not there
one reason for unwillingness to do so is that some of you would rather remain within reach of the country of your nativity
i do not know how much attachment you may have toward our race
it does not strike me that you have the greatest reason to love them
but still you are attached to them
at all events
the place i am thinking about for a colony is in central america
it is nearer to us than liberia not much more than one fourth as far as liberia
and within seven days' run by steamers
unlike liberia
it is a great line of travel it is a highway
the country is a very excellent one for any people
and with great natural resources and advantages
and especially because of the similarity of climate with your native soil
thus being suited to your physical condition
the particular place i have in view is to be a great highway from the atlantic or caribbean sea to the pacific ocean
and this particular place has all the advantages for a colony
on both sides there are harbors among the finest in the world
there is evidence of very rich coal mines
a certain amount of coal is valuable in any country
why i attach so much importance to coal is
it will afford an opportunity to the inhabitants for immediate employment till they get ready to settle permanently in their homes
if you take colonists where there is no good landing
there is a bad show and so where there is nothing to cultivate and of which to make a farm
but if something is started so that you can get your daily bread as soon as reach you there
it is a great advantage
coal land is the best thing i know of with which to commence an enterprise
to return you have been talked to upon this subject
and told that a speculation is intended by gentlemen who have an interest in the country
including the coal mines
we have been mistaken all our lives if we do not know whites
as well as blacks
look to their self interest
unless among those deficient of intellect
everybody you trade with makes something
you meet with these things here and everywhere
if such persons have what will be an advantage to them
the question is whether it cannot be made of advantage to you
you are intelligent
and know that success does not so much depend on external help as on self reliance
depends upon yourselves
as to the coal mines
i think i see the means available for your self reliance
i shall
if i get a sufficient number of you engaged
have provision made that you shall not be wronged
if you will engage in the enterprise
i will spend some of the money intrusted to me
i am not sure you will succeed
the government may lose the money but we cannot succeed unless we try
and we think with care we can succeed
the political affairs in central america are not in quite as satisfactory a condition as i wish
there are contending factions in that quarter
but it is true all the factions are agreed alike on the subject of colonization
and want it
and are more generous than we are here
to your colored race they have no objection i would endeavor to have you made the equals
and have the best assurance that you should be the equals
of the best
the practical thing i want to ascertain is whether i can get a number of able bodied men
with their wives and children
who are willing to go when i present evidence of encouragement and protection
could i get a hundred tolerably intelligent men
with their wives and children
and able to cut their own fodder
so to speak
can i have fifty
if i could find twenty five able bodied men
with a mixture of women and children good things in the family relation
i think
i could make a successful commencement
i want you to let me know whether this can be done or not
this is the practical part of my wish to see you
these are subjects of very great importance
worthy of a month's study
instead of a speech delivered in an hour
i ask you
to consider seriously
not pertaining to yourselves merely
nor for your race and ours for the present time
but as one of the things
if successfully managed
the good of mankind not confined to the present generation
but as from age to age descends the lay to millions yet to be
till far its echoes roll away into eternity
the above is merely given as the substance of the president's remarks
the chairman of the delegation briefly replied that they would hold a consultation
and in a short time give an answer
the president said
take your full time no hurry at all
the delegation then withdrew

dear sir
i have just read yours of the 19th
addressed to myself through the new york tribune
if there be in it any statements or assumptions of fact which i may know to be erroneous
i do not now and here controvert them
if there be in it any inferences which i may believe to be falsely drawn
i do not now and here argue against them
if there be perceptible in it an impatient and dictatorial tone
i waive it in deference to an old friend
whose heart i have always supposed to be right
as to the policy i seem to be pursuing
as you say
i have not meant to leave any one in doubt
i would save the union
i would save it the shortest way under the constitution
the sooner the national authority can be restored
the nearer the union will be
the union as it was
if there be those who would not save the union unless they could at the same time save slavery
i do not agree with them
if there be those who would not save the union unless they could at the same time destroy slavery
i do not agree with them
my paramount object in this struggle is to save the union
and is not either to save or destroy slavery
if i could save the union without freeing any slave
i would do it and if i could save it by freeing all the slaves
i would do it and if i could do it by freeing some and leaving others alone
i would also do that
what i do about slavery and the colored race
i do because i believe it helps to save this union and what i forbear
i forbear because i do not believe it would help to save the union
i shall do less whenever i shall believe what i am doing hurts the cause
and i shall do more whenever i shall believe doing more will help the cause
i shall try to correct errors when shown to be errors and i shall adopt new views so fast as they shall appear to be true views
i have here stated my purpose according to my view of official duty
and i intend no modification of my oft expressed personal wish that all men
could be free

his excellency andrew g
governor of pennsylvania
the application made to me by your adjutant general for authority to call out the militia of the state of pennsylvania has received careful consideration
it is my anxious desire to afford
as far as possible
the means and power of the federal government to protect the state of pennsylvania from invasion by the rebel forces and since
in your judgment
the militia of the state are required
and have been called upon by you
to organize for home defense and protection
i sanction the call that you have made
and will receive them into the service and pay of the united states to the extent they can be armed
and usefully employed
the arms and equipments now belonging to the general government will be needed for the troops called out for the national armies
so that arms can only be furnished for the quota of militia furnished by the draft of nine months' men
heretofore ordered
but as arms may be supplied by the militia under your call
with the 30
000 in your arsenal
will probably be sufficient for the purpose contemplated by your call
you will be authorized to provide such equipments as may be required
according to the regulations of the united states service
upon being turned over to the united states quartermaster's department
will be paid for at regulation prices
or the rates allowed by the department for such articles
railroad transportation will also be paid for
as in other cases
such general officers will be supplied as the exigencies of the service will permit

i have advices that jackson is crossing the potomac at williamsport
and probably the whole rebel army will be down from maryland

corroborates the idea that the enemy is crossing the potomac
please do not let him get off without being hurt
but he did
reply to request the president issue a proclamation of emancipation
a committee from the religious denominations of chicago
september 13
the subject presented in the memorial is one upon which i have thought much for weeks past
and i may even say for months
i am approached with the most opposite opinions and advice
and that by religious men
who are equally certain that they represent the divine will
i am sure that either the one or the other class is mistaken in that belief
and perhaps in some respects both
i hope it will not be irreverent for me to say that if it is probable that god would reveal his will to others
on a point so connected with my duty
it might be supposed he would reveal it directly to me for
unless i am more deceived in myself than i often am
it is my earnest desire to know the will of providence in this matter
and if i can learn what it is i will do it
these are not
the days of miracles
and i suppose it will be granted that i am not to expect a direct revelation
i must study the plain physical facts of the case
ascertain what is possible
and learn what appears to be wise and right
the subject is difficult
and good men do not agree
for instance
the other day
four gentlemen of standing and intelligence from new york called as a delegation on business connected with the war but before leaving two of them earnestly besought me to proclaim general emancipation
upon which the other two at once attacked them
you know also that the last session of congress had a decided majority of antislavery men
yet they could not unite on this policy
and the same is true of the religious people
the rebel soldiers are praying with a great deal more earnestness
i fear
than our own troops
and expecting god to favor their side
for one of our soldiers who had been taken prisoner told senator wilson a few days since that he met nothing so discouraging as the evident sincerity of those he was among in their prayers
but we will talk over the merits of the case
what good would a proclamation of emancipation from me do
especially as we are now situated
i do not want to issue a document that the whole world will see must necessarily be inoperative
like the pope's bull against the comet
would my word free the slaves
when i cannot even enforce the constitution in the rebel states
is there a single court
or magistrate or individual that would be influenced by it there
and what reason is there to think it would have any greater effect upon the slaves than the late law of congress
which i approved
and which offers protection and freedom to the slaves of rebel masters who come within our lines
yet i cannot learn that that law has caused a single slave to come over to us
and suppose they could be induced by a proclamation of freedom from me to throw themselves upon us
what should we do with them
how can we feed and care for such a multitude
general butler wrote me a few days since that he was issuing more rations to the slaves who have rushed to him than to all the white troops under his command
they eat
and that is all though it is true general butler is feeding the whites also by the thousand for it nearly amounts to a famine there
the pressure of the war should call off our forces from new orleans to defend some other point
what is to prevent the masters from reducing the blacks to slavery again
for i am told that whenever the rebels take any black prisoners
free or slave
they immediately auction them off
they did so with those they took from a boat that was aground in the tennessee river a few days ago
and then i am very ungenerously attacked for it
for instance
after the late battles at and near bull run
an expedition went out from washington under a flag of truce to bury the dead and bring in the wounded
and the rebels seized the blacks who went along to help
and sent them into slavery
horace greeley said in his paper that the government would probably do nothing about it
what could i do
tell me
if you please
what possible result of good would follow the issuing of such a proclamation as you desire
i raise no objections against it on legal or constitutional grounds for
as commander in chief of the army and navy
in time of war i suppose i have a right to take any measure which may best subdue the enemy nor do i urge objections of a moral nature
in view of possible consequences of insurrection and massacre at the south
i view this matter as a practical war measure
to be decided on according to the advantages or disadvantages it may offer to the suppression of the rebellion
i admit that slavery is the root of the rebellion
or at least its sine qua non
the ambition of politicians may have instigated them to act
but they would have been impotent without slavery as their instrument
i will also concede that emancipation would help us in europe
and convince them that we are incited by something more than ambition
i grant
that it would help somewhat at the north
though not so much
i fear
as you and those you represent imagine
some additional strength would be added in that way to the war
and then
it would weaken the rebels by drawing off their laborers
which is of great importance but i am not so sure we could do much with the blacks
if we were to arm them
i fear that in a few weeks the arms would be in the hands of the rebels and
thus far we have not had arms enough to equip our white troops
i will mention another thing
though it meet only your scorn and contempt
there are fifty thousand bayonets in the union armies from the border slave states
it would be a serious matter if
in consequence of a proclamation such as you desire
they should go over to the rebels
i do not think they all would not so many
as a year ago
or as six months ago not so many to day as yesterday
every day increases their union feeling
they are also getting their pride enlisted
and want to beat the rebels
let me say one thing more
i think you should admit that we already have an important principle to rally and unite the people
in the fact that constitutional government is at stake
this is a fundamental idea going down about as deep as anything
do not misunderstand me because i have mentioned these objections
they indicate the difficulties that have thus far prevented my action in some such way as you desire
i have not decided against a proclamation of liberty to the slaves
but hold the matter under advisement and i can assure you that the subject is on my mind
by day and night
more than any other
whatever shall appear to be god's will
i will do
i trust that in the freedom with which i have canvassed your views i have not in any respect injured your feelings

the president of the united states of america
a proclamation
abraham lincoln
president of the united states of america and commander in chief of the army and navy thereof
do hereby proclaim and declare that hereafter
as heretofore
the war will be prosecuted for the object of practically restoring the constitutional relation between the united states and each of the states and the people thereof in which states that relation is or may be suspended or disturbed
that it is my purpose
upon the next meeting of congress
to again recommend the adoption of a practical measure tendering pecuniary aid to the free acceptance or rejection of all slave states
so called
the people whereof may not then be in rebellion against the united states
and which states may then have voluntarily adopted
or thereafter may voluntarily adopt
immediate or gradual abolishment of slavery within their respective limits and that the effort to colonize persons of african descent with their consent upon this continent or elsewhere
with the previously obtained consent of the governments existing there
will be continued
that on the 1st day of january
all persons held as slaves within any state or designated part of a state the people whereof shall then be in rebellion against the united states shall be then
and forever free and the executive government of the united states
including the military and naval authority thereof
will recognize and maintain the freedom of such persons and will do no act or acts to repress such persons
or any of them
in any efforts they may make for their actual freedom
that the executive will on the 1st day of january aforesaid
by proclamation
designate the states and parts of states
if any
in which the people thereof
shall then be in rebellion against the united states and the fact that any state or the people thereof shall on that day be in good faith represented in the congress of the united states by members chosen thereto at elections wherein a majority of the qualified voters of such state shall have participated shall
in the absence of strong countervailing testimony
be deemed conclusive evidence that such state and the people thereof are not then in rebellion against the united states
that attention is hereby called to an act of congress entitled an act to make an additional article of war
approved march 13
and which act is in the words and figure following
be it enacted by the senate and house of representatives of the united states of america in congress assembled
that hereafter the following shall be promulgated as an additional article of war for the government of the army of the united states and shall be obeyed and observed as such
all officers or persons in the military or naval service of the united states are prohibited from employing any of the forces under their respective commands for the purpose of returning fugitives from service or labor who may have escaped from any person
to whom such service or labor is claimed to be due
and any officer who shall be found guilty by a court martial of violating this article shall be dismissed from the service
and be it further enacted
that this act shall take effect from and after its passage
also to the ninth and tenth sections of an act entitled an act to suppress insurrection
to punish treason and rebellion
to seize and confiscate the property of rebels
and for other purposes
approved july 17
and which sections are in the words and figures following
and be it further enacted
that all slaves of persons who shall hereafter be engaged in rebellion against the government of the united states
or who shall in any way give aid or comfort thereto
escaping from such persons and taking refuge within the lines of the army
and all slaves captured from such persons or deserted by them and coming under the control of the government of the united states
and all slaves of such persons found on or being within any place occupied by rebel forces and afterwards occupied by the forces of the united states
shall be deemed captives of war and shall be forever free of their servitude and not again held as slaves
and be it further enacted
that no slave escaping into any state
or the district of columbia from any other state shall be delivered up or in any way impeded or hindered of his liberty
except for crime
or some offence against the laws
unless the person claiming said fugitive shall first make oath that the person to whom the labor or service of such fugitive is alleged to be due is his lawful owner
and has not borne arms against the united states in the present rebellion
nor in any way given aid and comfort thereto and no person engaged in the military or naval service of the united states shall
under any pretense whatever
assume to decide on the validity of the claim of any person to the service or labor of any other person
or surrender up any such person to the claimant
on pain of being dismissed from the service
and i do hereby enjoin upon and order all persons engaged in the military and naval service of the united states to observe
and enforce
within their respective spheres of service
the act and sections above recited
and the executive will in due time recommend that all citizens of the united states who shall have remained loyal thereto throughout the rebellion shall upon the restoration of the constitutional relation between the united states and their respective states and people
if that relation shall have been suspended or disturbed be compensated for all losses by acts of the united states
including the loss of slaves
in witness whereof
i have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the united states to be affixed

september 24
the president of the united states of america a proclamation whereas it has become necessary to call into service not only volunteers
but also portions of the militia of the states by draft
in order to suppress the insurrection existing in the united states
and disloyal persons are not adequately restrained by the ordinary processes of law from hindering this measure
and from giving aid and comfort in various ways to the insurrection
be it ordered first
that during the existing insurrection
and as a necessary measure for suppressing the same
all rebels and insurgents
their aiders and abettors within the united states
and all persons discouraging volunteer enlistments
resisting militia drafts
or guilty of any disloyal practice affording aid and comfort to rebels against the authority of the united states
shall be subject to martial law
and liable to trial and punishment by courts martial or military commissions
that the writ of habeas corpus is suspended in respect to all persons arrested
or who are now
or hereafter during the rebellion shall be
imprisoned in any fort camp
military prison or other place of confinement by any military authority or by the sentence of any court martial or military commission

reply to serenade
september 24
i appear before you to do little more than acknowledge the courtesy you pay me
and to thank you for it
i have not been distinctly informed why it is that on this occasion you appear to do me this honor
though i suppose it is because of the proclamation
what i did
i did after a very full deliberation
and under a very heavy and solemn sense of responsibility
i can only trust in god i have made no mistake
i shall make no attempt on this occasion to sustain what i have done or said by any comment
it is now for the country and the world to pass judgment and
take action upon it
i will say no more upon this subject
in my position i am environed with difficulties
yet they are scarcely so great as the difficulties of those who upon the battle field are endeavoring to purchase with their blood and their lives the future happiness and prosperity of this country
let us never forget them
on the fourteenth and seventeenth days of this present month there have been battles bravely
and successfully fought
we do not yet know the particulars
let us be sure that
in giving praise to certain individuals
we do no injustice to others
i only ask you
at the conclusion of these few remarks
to give three hearty cheers for all good and brave officers and men who fought those successful battles

major john j
i am informed that
in answer to the question
why was not the rebel army bagged immediately after the battle near sharpsburg
propounded to you by major levi c
judge advocate
you said
that is not the game
the object is
that neither army shall get much advantage of the other that both shall be kept in the field till they are exhausted
when we will make a compromise and save slavery
i shall be very happy if you will
within twenty four hours from the receipt of this
prove to me by major turner that you did not
either literally or in substance
make the answer stated
above delivered to major key at 10

september 27th
at about 11 o'clock a
september 27
major key and major turner appeared before me
major turner says
as i remember it
the conversation was
why did we not bag them after the battle of sharpsburg
 major key's reply was
that was not the game that we should tire the rebels out and ourselves that that was the only way the union could be preserved
we come together fraternally
and slavery be saved
 on cross examination
major turner says he has frequently heard major key converse in regard to the present troubles
and never heard him utter a sentiment unfavorable to the maintenance of the union
he has never uttered anything which he
major t
would call disloyalty
the particular conversation detailed was a private one
indorsement on the above
in my view
it is wholly inadmissible for any gentleman holding a military commission from the united states to utter such sentiments as major key is within proved to have done
let major john j
key be forthwith dismissed from the military service of the united states

my dear sir
your kind letter of the 25th is just received
it is known to some that
while i hope something from the proclamation
my expectations are not as sanguine as are those of some friends
the time for its effect southward has not come but northward the effect should be instantaneous
it is six days old
while commendation in newspapers and by distinguished individuals is all that a vain man could wish
the stocks have declined
and troops come forward more slowly than ever
looked soberly in the face
is not very satisfactory
we have fewer troops in the field at the end of the six days than we had at the beginning the attrition among the old outnumbering the addition by the new
the north responds to the proclamation sufficiently in breath but breath alone kills no rebels
i wish i could write more cheerfully nor do i thank you the less for the kindness of your letter
yours very truly

paroled with terms to prevent their fighting the indians
and evidently seeking to commit us to their right to parole prisoners in that way
my inclination is to send the prisoners back with a definite notice that we will recognize no paroles given to our prisoners by the rebels as extending beyond a prohibition against fighting them
though i wish your opinion upon it
based both upon the general law and our cartel
i wish to avoid violations of the law and bad faith

as the thing
if done at all
should be done at once
president remarks to the army of the potomac at frederick
i am surrounded by soldiers and a little farther off by the citizens of this good city of frederick
nevertheless i can only say
as i did five minutes ago
it is not proper for me to make speeches in my present position
i return thanks to our soldiers for the good services they have rendered
the energy they have shown
the hardships they have endured
and the blood they have shed for this union of ours and i also return thanks
not only to the soldiers
but to the good citizens of frederick
and to the good men
and children in this land of ours
for their devotion to this glorious cause and i say this with no malice in my heart towards those who have done otherwise
may our children and children's children
for a thousand generations
continue to enjoy the benefits conferred upon us by a united country
and have cause yet to rejoice under these glorious institutions
bequeathed to us by washington and his compeers
my friends
soldiers and citizens
i can only say once more farewell
telegram from general halleck to general g
october 6
major general mcclellan
i am instructed to telegraph you as follows
the president directs that you cross the potomac and give battle to the enemy
or drive him south
your army must move now
while the roads are good
if you cross the river between the enemy and washington
and cover the latter by your operation
you can be reinforced by thirty thousand men
if you move up the valley of the shenandoah
not more than twelve or fifteen thousand can be sent you
the president advises the interior line between washington and the enemy
but does not order it
he is very desirous that your army move as soon as possible
you will immediately report what line you adopt
and when you intend to cross the river also to what point the reinforcements are to be sent
it is necessary that the plan of your operations be positively determined on
before orders are given for building bridges and repairing railroads
i am directed to add that the secretary of war and the general in chief fully concur with the president in these directions

you cannot have reflected seriously when you ask that i shall order general morgan's command to kentucky as a favor because they have marched from cumberland gap

buell's old troops
now in pursuit of bragg
have done more hard marching recently and
in fact
if you include marching and fighting
there are scarcely any old troops east or west of the mountains that have not done as hard service
i sincerely wish war was an easier and pleasanter business than it is but it does not admit of holidays

to general g
executive mansion
october 13
my dear sir you remember my speaking to you of what i called your over cautiousness
are you not over cautious when you assume that you cannot do what the enemy is constantly doing
should you not claim to be at least his equal in prowess
and act upon the claim
as i understand
you telegraphed general halleck that you cannot subsist your army at winchester unless the railroad from harper's ferry to that point be put in working order
but the enemy does now subsist his army at winchester
at a distance nearly twice as great from railroad transportation as you would have to do
without the railroad last named
he now wagons from culpepper court house
which is just about twice as far as you would have to do from harper's ferry
he is certainly not more than half as well provided with wagons as you are
i certainly should be pleased for you to have the advantage of the railroad from harper's perry to winchester but it wastes an the remainder of autumn to give it to you
in fact
ignores the question of time
which cannot and must not be ignored
one of the standard maxims of war
as you know
is to operate upon the enemy's communications as much as possible
without exposing your own
you seem to act as if this applies against you
but cannot apply in your favor
change positions with the enemy
and think you not he would break your communication with richmond within the next twenty four hours
you dread his going into pennsylvania
but if he does so in full force
he gives up his communications to you absolutely
and you have nothing to do but to follow and ruin him if he does so with less than full force
fall upon and beat what is left behind all the easier
exclusive of the water line
you are now nearer to richmond than the enemy is
by the route that you can and he must take
why can you not reach there before him
unless you admit that he is more than your equal on a march
his route is the arc of a circle
while yours is the chord
the roads are as good on yours as on his
you know i desired
but did not order
you to cross the potomac below instead of above the shenandoah and blue ridge
my idea was
that this would at once menace the enemy's communications
which i would seize if he would permit
if he should move northward
i would follow him closely
holding his communications
if he should prevent our seizing his communications
and move toward richmond
i would press closely to him
fight him if a favorable opportunity should present
and at least try to beat him to richmond on the inside track
i say try if we never try
we shall never succeed
if he makes a stand at winchester
moving neither north or south
i would fight him there
on the idea that if we cannot beat him when he bears the wastage of coming to us
we never can when we bear the wastage of going to him
this proposition is a simple truth
and is too important to be lost sight of for a moment
in coming to us he tenders us an advantage which we should not waive
we should not so operate as to merely drive him away
as we must beat him somewhere or fail finally
we can do it
if at all
easier near to us than far away
if we cannot beat the enemy where he now is
we never can
he again being within the entrenchments of richmond
the enemy was let back into richmond and it took another two years and thousands of dead for mcclelland cowardice if that was all that it was
i still suspect
and i think the evidence is overwhelming that he was
either secretly a supporter of the south
what is more likely
a politician readying for a different campaign
that of the presidency of the united states
recurring to the idea of going to richmond on the inside track
the facility of supplying from the side away from the enemy is remarkable
as it were
by the different spokes of a wheel extending from the hub toward the rim
and this whether you move directly by the chord or on the inside arc
hugging the blue ridge more closely
the chord line
as you see
carries you by aldie
hay market
and fredericksburg and you see how turnpikes
and finally the potomac
by aquia creek
meet you at all points from washington the same
only the lines lengthened a little
if you press closer to the blue ridge part of the way
the gaps through the blue ridge i understand to be about the following distances from harper's ferry
to wit
5 miles gregory's
13 snicker's
18 ashby's
28 manassas
38 chester
45 and thornton's
i should think it preferable to take the route nearest the enemy
disabling him to make an important move without your knowledge
and compelling him to keep his forces together for dread of you
the gaps would enable you to attack if you should wish
for a great part of the way you would be practically between the enemy and both washington and richmond
enabling us to spare you the greatest number of troops from here
when at length running for richmond ahead of him enables him to move this way
if he does so
turn and attack him in rear
but i think he should be engaged long before such a point is reached
it is all easy if our troops march as well as the enemy
and it is unmanly to say they cannot do it
this letter is in no sense an order

washington city
october 20
the insurrection which has for some time prevailed in several of the states of this union
including louisiana
having temporarily subverted and swept away the civil institutions of that state
including the judiciary and the judicial authorities of the union
so that it has become necessary to hold the state in military occupation
and it being indispensably necessary that there shall be some judicial tribunal existing there capable of administering justice
i have therefore thought it proper to appoint
and i do hereby constitute
a provisional court
which shall be a court of record
for the state of louisiana and i do hereby appoint charles a peabody
of new york
to be a provisional judge to hold said court
with authority to hear
and determine all causes
civil and criminal
including causes in law
and admiralty
and particularly all such powers and jurisdiction as belong to the district and circuit courts of the united states
conforming his proceedings so far as possible to the course of proceedings and practice which has been customary in the courts of the united states and louisiana
his judgment to be final and conclusive
and i do hereby authorize and empower the said judge to make and establish such rules and regulations as may be necessary for the exercise of his jurisdiction
and empower the said judge to appoint a prosecuting attorney
and clerk of the said court
who shall perform the functions of attorney
and clerk according to such proceedings and practice as before mentioned and such rules and regulations as may be made and established by said judge
these appointments are to continue during the pleasure of the president
not extending beyond the military occupation of the city of new orleans or the restoration of the civil authority in that city and in the state of louisiana
these officers shall be paid
out of the contingent fund of the war department
compensation as follows
the judge at the rate of 3500 per annum the prosecuting attorney
including the fees

in reply to mine about horses
of course you know the facts better than i still two considerations remain

yours of yesterday received
most certainly i intend no injustice to any

to be told
after more than five weeks' total inaction of the army
and during which period we have sent to the army every fresh horse we possibly could
amounting in the whole to 7918
that the cavalry horses were too much fatigued to move
presents a very cheerless
almost hopeless

when general mcclellan telegraphed asking general halleck to have the order made
general halleck went to the secretary of war with it
stating his approval of the plan
the secretary assented and general halleck wrote the order
it was a military question
which the secretary supposed the general understood better than he

bearer of this
has some apprehension that federal officers not citizens of louisiana may be set up as candidates for congress in that state
in my view there could be no possible object in such an election
we do not particularly need members of congress from there to enable us to get along with legislation here
what we do want is the conclusive evidence that respectable citizens of louisiana are willing to be members of congress and to swear support to the constitution
and that other respectable citizens there are willing to vote for them and send them
to send a parcel of northern men here as representatives
as would be understood and perhaps really so
at the point of the bayonet
would be disgusting and outrageous and were i a member of congress here
i would vote against admitting any such man to a seat

my dear general banks
early last week you left me in high hope with your assurance that you would be off with your expedition at the end of that week
or early in this
it is now the end of this
and i have just been overwhelmed and confounded with the sight of a requisition made by you which
i am assured
cannot be filled and got off within an hour short of two months
i enclose you a copy of the requisition
in some hope that it is not genuine that you have never seen it
my dear general
this expanding and piling up of impedimenta has been
so far
almost our ruin
and will be our final ruin if it is not abandoned
if you had the articles of this requisition upon the wharf
with the necessary animals to make them of any use
and forage for the animals
you could not get vessels together in two weeks to carry the whole
to say nothing of your twenty thousand men and
having the vessels
you could not put the cargoes aboard in two weeks more
after all
where you are going you have no use for them
when you parted with me you had no such ideas in your mind
i know you had not
or you could not have expected to be off so soon as you said
you must get back to something like the plan you had then
or your expedition is a failure before you start
you must be off before congress meets
you would be better off anywhere
and especially where you are going
for not having a thousand wagons doing nothing but hauling forage to feed the animals that draw them
and taking at least two thousand men to care for the wagons and animals
who otherwise might be two thousand good soldiers
dear general
do not think this is an ill natured letter it is the very reverse
the simple publication of this requisition would ruin you
very truly your friend

general carl schurz
my dear sir i have just received and read your letter of the 20th
the purport of it is that we lost the late elections and the administration is failing because the war is unsuccessful
and that i must not flatter myself that i am not justly to blame for it
i certainly know that if the war fails the administration fails
and that i will be blamed for it
whether i deserve it or not
and i ought to be blamed if i could do better
you think i could do better therefore you blame me already
i think i could not do better therefore i blame you for blaming me
i understand you now to be willing to accept the help of men who are not republicans
provided they have heart in it
agreed
i want no others
but who is to be the judge of hearts
or of heart in it
if i must discard my own judgment and take yours
i must also take that of others and by the time i should reject all i should be advised to reject
i should have none left
republicans or others not even yourself
for be assured
my dear sir
there are men who have heart in it that think you are performing your part as poorly as you think i am performing mine
i certainly have been dissatisfied with the slowness of buell and mcclellan but before i relieved them i had great fears i should not find successors to them who would do better and i am sorry to add that i have seen little since to relieve those fears
i do not see clearly the prospect of any more rapid movements
i fear we shall at last find out that the difficulty is in our case rather than in particular generals
i wish to disparage no one certainly not those who sympathize with me but i must say i need success more than i need sympathy
and that i have not seen the so much greater evidence of getting success from my sympathizers than from those who are denounced as the contrary
it does seem to me that in the field the two classes have been very much alike in what they have done and what they have failed to do
in sealing their faith with their blood
baker and lyon and bohien and richardson
did all that men could do but did they any more than kearny and stevens and reno and mansfield
none of whom were republicans
and some at least of whom have been bitterly and repeatedly denounced to me as secession sympathizers
i will not perform the ungrateful task of comparing cases of failure
in answer to your question
has it not been publicly stated in the newspapers
and apparently proved as a fact
that from the commencement of the war the enemy was continually supplied with information by some of the confidential subordinates of as important an officer as adjutant general thomas
i must say no
as far as my knowledge extends
and i add that if you can give any tangible evidence upon the subject
i will thank you to come to this city and do so
very truly your friend

my dear sir
few things perplex me more than this question between governor gamble and the war department
as to whether the peculiar force organized by the former in missouri are state troops or united states troops
this is either an immaterial or a mischievous question
if no more is desired than to have it settled what name the force is to be called by
it is immaterial
if it is desired for more than the fixing a name
it can only be to get a position from which to draw practical inferences then it is mischievous
instead of settling one dispute by deciding the question
i should merely furnish a nest full of eggs for hatching new disputes
i believe the force is not strictly either state troops or united states troops
it is of mixed character
i therefore think it is safer
when a practical question arises
to decide that question directly
and not indirectly by deciding a general abstraction supposed to include it
and also including a great deal more
without dispute governor gamble appoints the officers of this force
and fills vacancies when they occur
the question now practically in dispute is
can governor gamble make a vacancy by removing an officer or accepting a resignation
while it is proper that this question shall be settled
i do not perceive why either governor gamble or the government here should care which way it is settled
i am perplexed with it only because there seems to be pertinacity about it
it seems to me that it might be either way without injury to the service or that the offer of the secretary of war to let governor gamble make vacancies
and he the secretary to ratify the making of them
ought to be satisfactory

annual message to congress
december 1
fellow citizens of the senate and house of representatives since your last annual assembling another year of health and bountiful harvests has passed and while it has not pleased the almighty to bless us with a return of peace
we can but press on
guided by the best light he gives us
trusting that in his own good time and wise way all will yet be well
the correspondence touching foreign affairs which has taken place during the last year is herewith submitted
in virtual compliance with a request to that effect
made by the house of representatives near the close of the last session of congress
if the condition of our relations with other nations is less gratifying than it has usually been at former periods
it is certainly more satisfactory than a nation so unhappily distracted as we are might reasonably have apprehended
in the month of june last there were some grounds to expect that the maritime powers which
at the beginning of our domestic difficulties
so unwisely and unnecessarily
as we think
recognized the insurgents as a belligerent
would soon recede from that position
which has proved only less injurious to themselves than to our own country
but the temporary reverses which afterward befell the national arms
and which were exaggerated by our own disloyal citizens abroad
have hitherto delayed that act of simple justice
the civil war
which has so radically changed
for the moment
the occupations and habits of the american people
has necessarily disturbed the social condition
and affected very deeply the prosperity
of the nations with which we have carried on a commerce that has been steadily increasing throughout a period of half a century
it has
at the same time
excited political ambitions and apprehensions which have produced a profound agitation throughout the civilized world
in this unusual agitation we have forborne from taking part in any controversy between foreign states
and between parties or factions in such states
we have attempted no propagandism and acknowledged no revolution
but we have left to every nation the exclusive conduct and management of its own affairs
our struggle has been
of course
contemplated by foreign nations with reference less to its own merits than to its supposed and often exaggerated effects and consequences resulting to those nations themselves
complaint on the part of this government
even if it were just
would certainly be unwise
the treaty with great britain for the suppression of the slave trade has been put into operation with a good prospect of complete success
it is an occasion of special pleasure to acknowledge that the execution of it on the part of her majesty's government has been marked with a jealous respect for the authority of the united states and the rights of their moral and loyal citizens
the convention with hanover for the abolition of the state dues has been carried into full effect under the act of congress for that purpose
a blockade of 3000 miles of seacoast could not be established and vigorously enforced in a season of great commercial activity like the present without committing occasional mistakes and inflicting unintentional injuries upon foreign nations and their subjects
a civil war occurring in a country where foreigners reside and carry on trade under treaty stipulations is necessarily fruitful of complaints of the violation of neutral rights
all such collisions tend to excite misapprehensions
and possibly to produce mutual reclamations between nations which have a common interest in preserving peace and friendship
in clear cases of these kinds i have so far as possible heard and redressed complaints which have been presented by friendly powers
there is still
a large and an augmenting number of doubtful cases upon which the government is unable to agree with the governments whose protection is demanded by the claimants
there are
many cases in which the united states or their citizens suffer wrongs from the naval or military authorities of foreign nations which the governments of those states are not at once prepared to redress
i have proposed to some of the foreign states thus interested mutual conventions to examine and adjust such complaints
this proposition has been made especially to great britain
to france
to spain
and to prussia
in each case it has been kindly received
but has not yet been formally adopted
i deem it my duty to recommend an appropriation in behalf of the owners of the norwegian bark admiral p
which vessel was in may
prevented by the commander of the blockading force off charleston from leaving that port with cargo
notwithstanding a similar privilege had shortly before been granted to an english vessel
i have directed the secretary of state to cause the papers in the case to be communicated to the proper committees
applications have been made to me by many free americans of african descent to favor their emigration
with a view to such colonization as was contemplated in recent acts of congress
other parties
at home and abroad some from interested motives
others upon patriotic considerations
and still others influenced by philanthropic sentiments have suggested similar measures
on the other hand
several of the spanish american republics have protested against the sending of such colonies to their respective territories
under these circumstances i have declined to move any such colony to any state without first obtaining the consent of its government
with an agreement on its part to receive and protect such emigrants in all the rights of freemen and i have at the same time offered to the several states situated within the tropics
or having colonies there
to negotiate with them
subject to the advice and consent of the senate
to favor the voluntary emigration of persons of that class to their respective territories
upon conditions which shall be equal
and humane
liberia and haiti are as yet the only countries to which colonists of african descent from here could go with certainty of being received and adopted as citizens and i regret to say such persons contemplating colonization do not seem so willing to migrate to those countries as to some others
nor so willing as i think their interest demands
i believe
opinion among them in this respect is improving
and that ere long there will be an augmented and considerable migration to both these countries from the united states
the new commercial treaty between the united states and the sultan of turkey has been carried into execution
a commercial and consular treaty has been negotiated
subject to the senate's consent
with liberia
and a similar negotiation is now pending with the republic of haiti
a considerable improvement of the national commerce is expected to result from these measures
our relations with great britain
the netherlands
and the other european states remain undisturbed
very favorable relations also continue to be maintained with turkey
and japan
during the last year there has not only been no change of our previous relations with the independent states of our own continent
but more friendly sentiments than have heretofore existed are believed to be entertained by these neighbors
whose safety and progress are so intimately connected with our own
this statement especially applies to mexico
costa rica
and chile
the commission under the convention with the republic of new granada closed its session without having audited and passed upon all the claims which were submitted to it
a proposition is pending to revive the convention
that it may be able to do more complete justice
the joint commission between the united states and the republic of costa rica has completed its labors and submitted its report
i have favored the project for connecting the united states with europe by an atlantic telegraph
and a similar project to extend the telegraph from san francisco to connect by a pacific telegraph with the line which is being extended across the russian empire
the territories of the united states
with unimportant exceptions
have remained undisturbed by the civil war and they are exhibiting such evidence of prosperity as justifies an expectation that some of them will soon be in a condition to be organized as states and be constitutionally admitted into the federal union
the immense mineral resources of some of those territories ought to be developed as rapidly as possible
every step in that direction would have a tendency to improve the revenues of the government and diminish the burdens of the people
it is worthy of your serious consideration whether some extraordinary measures to promote that end cannot be adopted
the means which suggests itself as most likely to be effective is a scientific exploration of the mineral regions in those territories with a view to the publication of its results at home and in foreign countries results which cannot fail to be auspicious
the condition of the finances win claim your most diligent consideration
the vast expenditures incident to the military and naval operations required for the suppression of the rebellion have hitherto been met with a promptitude and certainty unusual in similar circumstances
and the public credit has been fully maintained
the continuance of the war
and the increased disbursements made necessary by the augmented forces now in the field demand your best reflections as to the best modes of providing the necessary revenue without injury to business and with the least possible burdens upon labor
the suspension of specie payments by the banks soon after the commencement of your last session made large issues of united states notes unavoidable
in no other way could the payment of troops and the satisfaction of other just demands be so economically or so well provided for
the judicious legislation of congress
securing the receivability of these notes for loans and internal duties and making them a legal tender for other debts
has made them an universal currency
and has satisfied
partially at least
and for the time
the long felt want of an uniform circulating medium
saving thereby to the people immense sums in discounts and exchanges
a return to specie payments
at the earliest period compatible with due regard to all interests concerned should ever be kept in view
fluctuations in the value of currency are always injurious
and to reduce these fluctuations to the lowest possible point will always be a leading purpose in wise legislation
prompt and certain convertibility
into coin is generally acknowledged to be the best and surest safeguard against them and it is extremely doubtful whether a circulation of united states notes payable in coin and sufficiently large for the wants of the people can be permanently
and safely maintained
is there
any other mode in which the necessary provision for the public wants can be made and the great advantages of a safe and uniform currency secured
i know of none which promises so certain results and is at the same time so unobjectionable as the organization of banking associations
under a general act of congress
well guarded in its provisions
to such associations the government might furnish circulating notes
on the security of united states bonds deposited in the treasury
these notes
prepared under the supervision of proper officers
being uniform in appearance and security and convertible always into coin
would at once protect labor against the evils of a vicious currency and facilitate commerce by cheap and safe exchanges
a moderate reservation from the interest on the bonds would compensate the united states for the preparation and distribution of the notes and a general supervision of the system
and would lighten the burden of that part of the public debt employed as securities
the public credit
would be greatly improved and the negotiation of new loans greatly facilitated by the steady market demand for government bonds which the adoption of the proposed system would create
it is an additional recommendation of the measure
of considerable weight
in my judgment
that it would reconcile as far as possible all existing interests by the opportunity offered to existing institutions to reorganize under the act
substituting only the secured uniform national circulation for the local and various circulation
secured and unsecured
now issued by them
the receipts into the treasury from all sources
including loans and balance from the preceding year
for the fiscal year ending on the 30th june
were 583
of which sum 49
62 were derived from customs 1
73 from the direct tax from public lands
77 from miscellaneous sources
64 from loans in all forms
the remainder
was the balance from last year
the disbursements during the same period were
for congressional
and judicial purposes
29 for foreign intercourse
35 for miscellaneous expenses
including the mints
post office deficiencies
collection of revenue
and other like charges
50 for expenses under the interior department
52 under the war department
36 under the navy department
69 for interest on public debt
45 and for payment of public debt
including reimbursement of temporary loan and redemptions
09 making an aggregate of 570
and leaving a balance in the treasury on the 1st day of july
of 13
it should be observed that the sum of 96
expended for reimbursements and redemption of public debt
being included also in the loans made
may be properly deducted both from receipts and expenditures
leaving the actual receipts for the year 487
and the expenditures 474
other information on the subject of the finances will be found in the report of the secretary of the treasury
to whose statements and views i invite your most candid and considerate attention
the reports of the secretaries of war and of the navy are herewith transmitted
these reports
though lengthy
are scarcely more than brief abstracts of the very numerous and extensive transactions and operations conducted through those departments
nor could i give a summary of them here upon any principle which would admit of its being much shorter than the reports themselves
i therefore content myself with laying the reports before you and asking your attention to them
it gives me pleasure to report a decided improvement in the financial condition of the post office department as compared with several preceding years
the receipts for the fiscal year 1861 amounted to 8
which embraced the revenue from all the states of the union for three quarters of that year
notwithstanding the cessation of revenue from the so called seceded states during the last fiscal year
the increase of the correspondence of the loyal states has been sufficient to produce a revenue during the same year of 8
being only 50
000 less than was derived from all the states of the union during the previous year
the expenditures show a still more favorable result
the amount expended in 1861 was 13
for the last year the amount has been reduced to 11
showing a decrease of about 2
000 in the expenditures as compared with the preceding year
and about 3
000 as compared with the fiscal year 1860
the deficiency in the department for the previous year was 4
for the last fiscal year it was reduced to 2
these favorable results are in part owing to the cessation of mail service in the insurrectionary states and in part to a careful review of all expenditures in that department in the interest of economy
the efficiency of the postal service
it is believed
has also been much improved
the postmaster general has also opened a correspondence through the department of state with foreign governments proposing a convention of postal representatives for the purpose of simplifying the rates of foreign postage and to expedite the foreign mails
this proposition
equally important to our adopted citizens and to the commercial interests of this country
has been favorably entertained and agreed to by all the governments from whom replies have been received
i ask the attention of congress to the suggestions of the postmaster general in his report respecting the further legislation required
in his opinion
for the benefit of the postal service
the secretary of the interior reports as follows in regard to the public lands
the public lands have ceased to be a source of revenue
from the 1st july
to the 30th september
the entire cash receipts from the sale of lands were 137
2 a sum much less than the expenses of our land system during the same period
the homestead law
which will take effect on the 1st of january next
offers such inducements to settlers that sales for cash cannot be expected to an extent sufficient to meet the expenses of the general land office and the cost of surveying and bringing the land into market
the discrepancy between the sum here stated as arising from the sales of the public lands and the sum derived from the same source as reported from the treasury department arises
as i understand
from the fact that the periods of time
though apparently were not really coincident at the beginning point
the treasury report including a considerable sum now which had previously been reported from the interior
sufficiently large to greatly overreach the sum derived from the three months now reported upon by the interior and not by the treasury
the indian tribes upon our frontiers have during the past year manifested a spirit of insubordination
and at several points have engaged in open hostilities against the white settlements in their vicinity
the tribes occupying the indian country south of kansas renounced their allegiance to the united states and entered into treaties with the insurgents
those who remained loyal to the united states were driven from the country
the chief of the cherokees has visited this city for the purpose of restoring the former relations of the tribe with the united states
he alleges that they were constrained by superior force to enter into treaties with the insurgents
and that the united states neglected to furnish the protection which their treaty stipulations required
in the month of august last the sioux indians in minnesota attacked the settlements in their vicinity with extreme ferocity
killing indiscriminately men
and children
this attack was wholly unexpected
and therefore no means of defense had been provided
it is estimated that not less than 800 persons were killed by the indians
and a large amount of property was destroyed
how this outbreak was induced is not definitely known
and suspicions
which may be unjust
need not to be stated
information was received by the indian bureau from different sources about the time hostilities were commenced that a simultaneous attack was to be made upon white settlements by all the tribes between the mississippi river and the rocky mountains
the state of minnesota has suffered great injury from this indian war
a large portion of her territory has been depopulated
and a severe loss has been sustained by the destruction of property
the people of that state manifest much anxiety for the removal of the tribes beyond the limits of the state as a guaranty against future hostilities
the commissioner of indian affairs will furnish full details
i submit for your especial consideration whether our indian system shall not be remodeled
many wise and good men have impressed me with the belief that this can be profitably done
i submit a statement of the proceedings of commissioners
which shows the progress that has been made in the enterprise of constructing the pacific railroad
and this suggests the earliest completion of this road
and also the favorable action of congress upon the projects now pending before them for enlarging the capacities of the great canals in new york and illinois
as being of vital and rapidly increasing importance to the whole nation
and especially to the vast interior region hereinafter to be noticed at some greater length
i purpose having prepared and laid before you at an early day some interesting and valuable statistical information upon this subject
the military and commercial importance of enlarging the illinois and michigan canal and improving the illinois river is presented in the report of colonel webster to the secretary of war
and now transmitted to congress
i respectfully ask attention to it
to carry out the provisions of the act of congress of the 15th of may last
i have caused the department of agriculture of the united states to be organized
the commissioner informs me that within the period of a few months this department has established an extensive system of correspondence and exchanges
both at home and abroad
which promises to effect highly beneficial results in the development of a correct knowledge of recent improvements in agriculture
in the introduction of new products
and in the collection of the agricultural statistics of the different states
that it will soon be prepared to distribute largely seeds
and cuttings
and has already published and liberally diffused much valuable information in anticipation of a more elaborate report
which will in due time be furnished
embracing some valuable tests in chemical science now in progress in the laboratory
the creation of this department was for the more immediate benefit of a large class of our most valuable citizens
and i trust that the liberal basis upon which it has been organized will not only meet your approbation
but that it will realize at no distant day all the fondest anticipations of its most sanguine friends and become the fruitful source of advantage to all our people
on the 22d day of september last a proclamation was issued by the executive
a copy of which is herewith submitted
in accordance with the purpose expressed in the second paragraph of that paper
i now respectfully recall your attention to what may be called compensated emancipation
a nation may be said to consist of its territory
its people
and its laws
the territory is the only part which is of certain durability
one generation passeth away and another generation cometh
but the earth abideth forever
it is of the first importance to duly consider and estimate this ever enduring part
that portion of the earth's surface which is owned and inhabited by the people of the united states is well adapted to be the home of one national family
and it is not well adapted for two or more
its vast extent and its variety of climate and productions are of advantage in this age for one people
whatever they might have been in former ages
and intelligence have brought these to be an advantageous combination for one united people
in the inaugural address i briefly pointed out the total inadequacy of disunion as a remedy for the differences between the people of the two sections
i did so in language which i cannot improve
and which
i beg to repeat
one section of our country believes slavery is right and ought to be extended
while the other believes it is wrong and ought not to be extended
this is the only substantial dispute
the fugitive slave clause of the constitution and the laws for the suppression of the foreign slave trade are each as well enforced
as any law can ever be in a community where the moral sense of the people imperfectly supports the law itself
the great body of the people abide by the dry legal obligation in both cases
and a few break over in each
i think
cannot be perfectly cured
and it would be worse in both cases after the separation of the sections than before
the foreign slave trade
now imperfectly suppressed
would be ultimately revived without restriction in one section
while fugitive slaves
now only partially surrendered
would not be surrendered at all by the other
physically speaking
we can not separate
we can not remove our respective sections from each other nor build an impassable wall between them
a husband and wife may be divorced and go out of the presence and beyond the reach of each other
but the different parts of our country cannot do this
they cannot but remain face to face
and intercourse
either amicable or hostile
must continue between them
is it possible
to make that intercourse more advantageous or more satisfactory after separation than before
can aliens make treaties easier than friends can make laws
can treaties be more faithfully enforced between aliens than laws can among friends
suppose you go to war
you cannot fight always and when
after much loss on both sides and no gain on either
you cease fighting
the identical old questions
as to terms of intercourse
are again upon you
there is no line
straight or crooked
suitable for a national boundary upon which to divide
trace through
from east to west
upon the line between the free and slave country
and we shall find a little more than one third of its length are rivers
easy to be crossed
and populated
or soon to be populated
thickly upon both sides while nearly all its remaining length are merely surveyors' lines
over which people may walk back and forth without any consciousness of their presence
no part of this line can be made any more difficult to pass by writing it down on paper or parchment as a national boundary
the fact of separation
if it comes
gives up on the part of the seceding section the fugitive slave clause along with all other constitutional obligations upon the section seceded from
while i should expect no treaty stipulation would ever be made to take its place
but there is another difficulty
the great interior region bounded east by the alleghenies
north by the british dominions
west by the rocky mountains
and south by the line along which the culture of corn and cotton meets
and which includes part of virginia
part of tennessee
all of kentucky
and the territories of dakota
and part of colorado
already has above 10
000 people
and will have 50
000 within fifty years if not prevented by any political folly or mistake
it contains more than one third of the country owned by the united states certainly more than 1
000 square miles
once half as populous as massachusetts already is
it would have more than 75
000 people
a glance at the map shows that
territorially speaking
it is the great body of the republic
the other parts are but marginal borders to it
the magnificent region sloping west from the rocky mountains to the pacific being the deepest and also the richest in undeveloped resources
in the production of provisions
and all which proceed from them this great interior region is naturally one of the most important in the world
ascertain from statistics the small proportion of the region which has yet been brought into cultivation
and also the large and rapidly increasing amount of products
and we shall be overwhelmed with the magnitude of the prospect presented
and yet this region has no seacoast touches no ocean anywhere
as part of one nation
its people now find
and may forever find
their way to europe by new york
to south america and africa by new orleans
and to asia by san francisco but separate our common country into two nations
as designed by the present rebellion
and every man of this great interior region is thereby cut off from some one or more of these outlets
not perhaps by a physical barrier
but by embarrassing and onerous trade regulations
and this is true
wherever a dividing or boundary line may be fixed
place it between the now free and slave country
or place it south of kentucky or north of ohio
and still the truth remains that none south of it can trade to any port or place north of it
and none north of it can trade to any port or place south of it
except upon terms dictated by a government foreign to them
these outlets
and south
are indispensable to the well being of the people inhabiting and to inhabit this vast interior region
which of the three may be the best is no proper question
all are better than either
and all of right belong to that people and to their successors forever
true to themselves
they will not ask where a line of separation shall be
but will vow rather that there shall be no such line
nor are the marginal regions less interested in these communications to and through them to the great outside world
and each of them
must have access to this egypt of the west without paying toll at the crossing of any national boundary
our national strife springs not from our permanent part not from the land we inhabit not from our national homestead
there is no possible severing of this but would multiply and not mitigate evils among us
in all its adaptations and aptitudes it demands union and abhors separation
in fact
it would ere long force reunion
however much of blood and treasure the separation might have cost
our strife pertains to ourselves to the passing generations of men and it can without convulsion be hushed forever with the passing of one generation
in this view i recommend the adoption of the following resolution and articles amendatory to the constitution of the united states
resolved by the senate and house of representatives of the united states of america
in congress assembled
two thirds of both houses concurring
that the following articles be proposed to the legislatures or conventions of the several states as amendments to the constitution of the united states
all or any of which articles
when ratified by three fourths of the said legislatures or conventions
to be valid as part or parts of the said constitution
every state wherein slavery now exists which shall abolish the same therein at any time or times before the 1st day of january
shall receive compensation from the united states as follows
to wit
the president of the united states shall deliver to every such state bonds of the united states bearing interest at the rate of per cent
per annum to an amount equal to the aggregate sum of for each slave shown to have been therein by the eighth census of the united states
said bonds to be delivered to such state by instalments or in one parcel at the completion of the abolishment
accordingly as the same shall have been gradual or at one time within such state and interest shall begin to run upon any such bond only from the proper time of its delivery as aforesaid
any state having received bonds as aforesaid and afterwards reintroducing or tolerating slavery therein shall refund to the united states the bonds so received
or the value thereof
and all interest paid thereon
all slaves who shall have enjoyed actual freedom by the chances of the war at any time before the end of the rebellion shall be forever free but all owners of such who shall not have been disloyal shall be compensated for them at the same rates as is provided for states adopting abolishment of slavery
but in such way that no slave shall be twice accounted for
congress may appropriate money and otherwise provide for colonizing free colored persons with their own consent at any place or places without the united states
i beg indulgence to discuss these proposed articles at some length
without slavery the rebellion could never have existed without slavery it could not continue
among the friends of the union there is great diversity of sentiment and of policy in regard to slavery and the african race amongst us
some would perpetuate slavery some would abolish it suddenly and without compensation some would abolish it gradually and with compensation some would remove the freed people from us
and some would retain them with us and there are yet other minor diversities
because of these diversities we waste much strength in struggles among ourselves
by mutual concession we should harmonize and act together
this would be compromise
but it would be compromise among the friends and not with the enemies of the union
these articles are intended to embody a plan of such mutual concessions
if the plan shall be adopted
it is assumed that emancipation will follow
at least in several of the states
as to the first article
the main points are
the emancipation secondly
the length of time for consummating it thirty seven years and
the compensation
the emancipation will be unsatisfactory to the advocates of perpetual slavery
but the length of time should greatly mitigate their dissatisfaction
the time spares both races from the evils of sudden derangement in fact
from the necessity of any derangement while most of those whose habitual course of thought will be disturbed by the measure will have passed away before its consummation
they will never see it
another class will hail the prospect of emancipation
but will deprecate the length of time
they will feel that it gives too little to the now living slaves
but it really gives them much
it saves them from the vagrant destitution which must largely attend immediate emancipation in localities where their numbers are very great
and it gives the inspiring assurance that their posterity shall be free forever
the plan leaves to each state choosing to act under it to abolish slavery now or at the end of the century
or at any intermediate tune
or by degrees extending over the whole or any part of the period
and it obliges no two states to proceed alike
it also provides for compensation
and generally the mode of making it
it would seem
must further mitigate the dissatisfaction of those who favor perpetual slavery
and especially of those who are to receive the compensation
doubtless some of those who are to pay and not to receive will object
yet the measure is both just and economical
in a certain sense the liberation of slaves is the destruction of property property acquired by descent or by purchase
the same as any other property
it is no less true for having been often said that the people of the south are not more responsible for the original introduction of this property than are the people of the north and when it is remembered how unhesitatingly we all use cotton and sugar and share the profits of dealing in them
it may not be quite safe to say that the south has been more responsible than the north for its continuance
for a common object this property is to be sacrificed
is it not just that it be done at a common charge
and if with less money
or money more easily paid
we can preserve the benefits of the union by this means than we can by the war alone
is it not also economical to do it
let us consider it
let us ascertain the sum we have expended in the war since compensated emancipation was proposed last march
and consider whether if that measure had been promptly accepted by even some of the slave states the same sum would not have done more to close the war than has been otherwise done
if so
the measure would save money
and in that view would be a prudent and economical measure
certainly it is not so easy to pay something as it is to pay nothing
but it is easier to pay a large sum than it is to pay a larger one
and it is easier to pay any sum when we are able than it is to pay it before we are able
the war requires large sums
and requires them at once
the aggregate sum necessary for compensated emancipation of course would be large
but it would require no ready cash
nor the bonds even any faster than the emancipation progresses
this might not
and probably would not
close before the end of the thirty seven years
at that time we shall probably have a hundred millions of people to share the burden
instead of thirty one millions as now
and not only so
but the increase of our population may be expected to continue for a long time after that period as rapidly as before
because our territory will not have become full
i do not state this inconsiderately
at the same ratio of increase which we have maintained
on an average
from our first national census
in 1790
until that of 1860
we should in 1900 have a population of 103
and why may we not continue that ratio far beyond that period
our abundant room
our broad national homestead
is our ample resource
were our territory as limited as are the british isles
very certainly our population could not expand as stated
instead of receiving the foreign born as now
we should be compelled to send part of the native born away
but such is not our condition
we have 2
000 square miles
europe has 3
with a population averaging 73 persons to the square mile
why may not our country at some time average as many
is it less fertile
has it more waste surface by mountains
or other causes
is it inferior to europe in any natural advantage
we are at some time to be as populous as europe
how soon
as to when this may be
we can judge by the past and the present as to when it will be
if ever
depends much on whether we maintain the union
a page of tables of projected statistics these figures show that our country may be as populous as europe now is at some point between 1920 and 1930
say about 1925 our territory
at 73 persons to the square mile
being of capacity to contain 217
and we will reach this
if we do not ourselves relinquish the chance by the folly and evils of disunion or by long and exhausting war springing from the only great element of national discord among us
while it cannot be foreseen exactly how much one huge example of secession
breeding lesser ones indefinitely
would retard population
and prosperity
no one can doubt that the extent of it would be very great and injurious
the proposed emancipation would shorten the war
perpetuate peace
insure this increase of population
and proportionately the wealth of the country
with these we should pay all the emancipation would cost
together with our other debt
easier than we should pay our other debt without it
if we had allowed our old national debt to run at six per cent
per annum
simple interest
from the end of our revolutionary struggle until to day
without paying anything on either principal or interest
each man of us would owe less upon that debt now than each man owed upon it then and this because our increase of men through the whole period has been greater than six per cent
has run faster than the interest upon the debt
thus time alone relieves a debtor nation
so long as its population increases faster than unpaid interest accumulates on its debt
this fact would be no excuse for delaying payment of what is justly due
but it shows the great importance of time in this connection the great advantage of a policy by which we shall not have to pay until we number 100
000 what by a different policy we would have to pay now
when we number but 31
in a word
it shows that a dollar will be much harder to pay for the war than will be a dollar for emancipation on the proposed plan
and then the latter will cost no blood
no precious life
it will be a saving of both
as to the second article
i think it would be impracticable to return to bondage the class of persons therein contemplated
some of them
in the property sense belong to loyal owners
and hence provision is made in this article for compensating such
the third article relates to the future of the freed people
it does not oblige
but merely authorizes congress to aid in colonizing such as may consent
this ought nut to be regarded as objectionable on the one hand or on the other
insomuch as it comes to nothing unless by the mutual consent of the people to be deported and the american voters through their representatives in congress
i cannot make it better known than it already is that i strongly favor colonization and yet i wish to say there is an objection urged against free colored persons remaining in the country which is largely imaginary
if not sometimes malicious
it is insisted that their presence would injure and displace white labor and white laborers
if there ever could be a proper time for mere catch arguments that time surely is not now
in times like the present men should utter nothing for which they would not willingly be responsible through time and in eternity
is it true
that colored people can displace any more white labor by being free than by remaining slaves
if they stay in their old places
they jostle no white laborers if they leave their old places
they leave them open to white laborers
there is neither more nor less of it
even without deportation
would probably enhance the wages of white labor
and very surely would not reduce them
thus the customary amount of labor would still have to be performed
the freed people would surely not do more than their old proportion of it
and very probably for a time would do less
leaving an increased part to white laborers
bringing their labor into greater demand
and consequently enhancing the wages of it
with deportation
even to a limited extent
enhanced wages to white labor is mathematically certain
labor is like any other commodity in the market increase the demand for it and you increase the price of it
reduce the supply of black labor by colonizing the black laborer out of the country
and by precisely so much you increase the demand for and wages of white labor
but it is dreaded that the freed people will swarm forth and cover the whole land
are they not already in the land
will liberation make them any more numerous
equally distributed among the whites of the whole country
and there would be but one colored to seven whites
could the one in any way greatly disturb the seven
there are many communities now having more than one free colored person to seven whites
and this without any apparent consciousness of evil from it
the district of columbia and the states of maryland and delaware are all in this condition
the district has more than one free colored to six whites
and yet in its frequent petitions to congress i believe it has never presented the presence of free colored persons as one of its grievances
but why should emancipation south send the free people north
people of any color seldom run unless there be something to run from
heretofore colored people to some extent have fled north from bondage
and now
from both bondage and destitution
but if gradual emancipation and deportation be adopted
they will have neither to flee from
their old masters will give them wages at least until new laborers can be procured
and the freedmen in turn will gladly give their labor for the wages till new homes can be found for them in congenial climes and with people of their own blood and race
this proposition can be trusted on the mutual interests involved
and in any event
cannot the north decide for itself whether to receive them
as practice proves more than theory in any case
has there been any irruption of colored people northward because of the abolishment of slavery in this district last spring
what i have said of the proportion of free colored persons to the whites in the district is from the census of 1860
having no reference to persons called contrabands nor to those made free by the act of congress abolishing slavery here
the plan consisting of these articles is recommended
not but that a restoration of the national authority would be accepted without its adoption
nor will the war nor proceedings under the proclamation of september 22
be stayed because of the recommendation of this plan
its timely adoption
i doubt not
would bring restoration
and thereby stay both
and notwithstanding this plan
the recommendation that congress provide by law for compensating any state which may adopt emancipation before this plan shall have been acted upon is hereby earnestly renewed
such would be only an advance part of the plan
and the same arguments apply to both
this plan is recommended as a means
not in exclusion of
but additional to
all others for restoring and preserving the national authority throughout the union
the subject is presented exclusively in its economical aspect
the plan would
i am confident
secure peace more speedily and maintain it more permanently than can be done by force alone
while all it would cost
considering amounts and manner of payment and times of payment
would be easier paid than will be the additional cost of the war if we rely solely upon force
it is much
very much
that it would cost no blood at all
the plan is proposed as permanent constitutional law
it cannot become such without the concurrence of
two thirds of congress
and afterwards three fourths of the states
the requisite three fourths of the states will necessarily include seven of the slave states
their concurrence
if obtained
will give assurance of their severally adopting emancipation at no very distant day upon the new constitutional terms
this assurance would end the struggle now and save the union forever
i do not forget the gravity which should characterize a paper addressed to the congress of the nation by the chief magistrate of the nation
nor do i forget that some of you are my seniors
nor that many of you have more experience than i in the conduct of public affairs
yet i trust that in view of the great responsibility resting upon me you will perceive no want of respect to yourselves in any undue earnestness i may seem to display
is it doubted
that the plan i propose
if adopted
would shorten the war
and thus lessen its expenditure of money and of blood
is it doubted that it would restore the national authority and national prosperity and perpetuate both indefinitely
is it doubted that we here congress and executive can secure its adoption
will not the good people respond to a united and earnest appeal from us
can we
can they
by any other means so certainly or so speedily assure these vital objects
we can succeed only by concert
it is not can any of us imagine better
but can we all do better
object whatsoever is possible
still the question recurs
can we do better
the dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate to the stormy present
the occasion is piled high with difficulty
and we must rise with the occasion
as our case is new
so we must think anew and act anew
we must disenthrall ourselves
and then we shall save our country
we can not escape history
we of this congress and this administration will be remembered in spite of ourselves
no personal significance or insignificance can spare one or another of us
the fiery trial through which we pass will light us down in honor or dishonor to the latest generation
we say we are for the union
the world will not forget that we say this
we know how to save the union
the world knows we do know how to save it
even we here
hold the power and bear the responsibility
in giving freedom to the slave we assure freedom to the free honorable alike in what we give and what we preserve
we shall nobly save or meanly lose the last
best hope of earth
other means may succeed this could not fail
the way is plain
just a way which if followed the world will forever applaud and god must forever bless

to the senate and house of representatives
on the 3d of november
a collision took place off the coast of cuba between the united states war steamer san jacinto and the french brig jules et marie
resulting in serious damage to the latter
the obligation of this government to make amends therefor could not be questioned if the injury resulted from any fault on the part of the san jacinto
with a view to ascertain this
the subject was referred to a commission of the united states and french naval officers at new york
with a naval officer of italy as an arbiter
the conclusion arrived at was that the collision was occasioned by the failure of the san jacinto seasonably to reverse her engine
it then became necessary to ascertain the amount of indemnification due to the injured party
the united states consul general at havana was consequently instructed to confer with the consul of france on this point
and they have determined that the sum of 9
500 is an equitable allowance under the circumstances
i recommend an appropriation of this sum for the benefit of the owners of the jules et marie

the consul general of the united states at havana

message to the senate

to the senate of the united states
in compliance with your resolution of december 5
requesting the president to furnish the senate with all information in his possession touching the late indian barbarities in the state of minnesota
and also the evidence in his possession upon which some of the principal actors and head men were tried and condemned to death
i have the honor to state that on receipt of said resolution
i transmitted the same to the secretary of the interior
accompanied by a note
a copy of which is herewith inclosed
marked a
and in response to which i received
through that department
a letter of the commissioner of indian affairs
a copy of which is herewith inclosed
marked b
i further state that on the eighth day of november last i received a long telegraphic despatch from major general pope
at st
simply announcing the names of the persons sentenced to be hanged
i immediately telegraphed to have transcripts of the records in all cases forwarded to me
which transcripts
did not reach me until two or three days before the present meeting of congress
meantime i received
through telegraphic despatches and otherwise
appeals in behalf of the condemned
appeals for their execution
and expressions of opinion as to the proper policy in regard to them and to the indians generally in that vicinity
none of which
as i understand
falls within the scope of your inquiry
after the arrival of the transcripts of records
but before i had sufficient opportunity to examine them
i received a joint letter from one of the senators and two of the representatives from minnesota
which contains some statements of fact not found in the records of the trials
and for which reason i herewith transmit a copy
marked c
i also
for the same reason
inclose a printed memorial of the citizens of st
addressed to me
and forwarded with the letter aforesaid
anxious to not act with so much clemency as to encourage another outbreak on the one hand
nor with so much severity as to be real cruelty on the other
i caused a careful examination of the records of trials to be made
in view of first ordering the execution of such as had been proved guilty of violating females
contrary to my expectation
only two of this class were found
i then directed a further examination and a classification of all who were proven to have participated in massacres
as distinguished from participation in battles
this class numbered forty
and included the two convicted of female violation
one of the number is strongly recommended
by the commission which tried them
for commutation to ten years imprisonment i have ordered the other thirty nine to be executed on friday the 19th instant
the order was despatched from here on monday
the 8th instant
by a messenger to general sibley
and a copy of which order is herewith transmitted

an abstract of the evidence as to the forty is herewith inclosed

fernando wood
my dear sir
your letter of the 8th
with the accompanying note of same date
was received yesterday
the most important paragraph in the letter
as i consider
is in these words
on the 25th of november last i was advised by an authority which i deemed likely to be well informed
as well as reliable and truthful
that the southern states would send representatives to the next congress
provided that a full and general amnesty should permit them to do so
no guarantee or terms were asked for other than the amnesty referred to
i strongly suspect your information will prove to be groundless nevertheless
i thank you for communicating it to me
understanding the phrase in the paragraph just quoted the southern states would send representatives to the next congress to be substantially the same as that the people of the southern states would cease resistance
and would reinaugurate
submit to
and maintain the national authority within the limits of such states
under the constitution of the united states
i say that in such case the war would cease on the part of the united states and that if within a reasonable time a full and general amnesty were necessary to such end
it would not be withheld
i do not think it would be proper now to communicate this
formally or informally
to the people of the southern states
my belief is that they already know it and when they choose
if ever
they can communicate with me unequivocally

such information might be more valuable before the 1st of january than afterwards
while there is nothing in this letter which i shall dread to see in history
it is

you can scarcely overestimate the pleasure it would give me to oblige you
but nothing is operating so ruinously upon us everywhere as absenteeism
it positively will not do for me to grant leaves of absence in cases not sufficient to procure them under the regular rules

to the army of the potomac
i have just read your general's report of the battle of fredericksburg
although you were not successful
the attempt was not an error
nor the failure other than accident
the courage with which you
in an open field
maintained the contest against an intrenched foe
and the consummate skill and success with which you crossed and recrossed the river in the face of the enemy
show that you possess all the qualities of a great army
which will yet give victory to the cause of the country and of popular government

and sympathizing with the severely wounded

dear fanny
it is with deep regret that i learn of the death of your kind and brave father
and especially that it is affecting your young heart beyond what is common in such cases
in this sad world of ours sorrow comes to all
and to the young it comes with bittered agony because it takes them unawares
the older have learned ever to expect it
i am anxious to afford some alleviation of your present distress
perfect relief is not possible
except with time
you cannot now realize that you will ever feel better
is not this so
and yet it is a mistake
you are sure to be happy again
to know this
which is certainly true
will make you some less miserable now
i have had experience enough to know what i say
and you need only to believe it to feel better at once
the memory of your dear father
instead of an agony
will yet be a sad
sweet feeling in your heart
of a purer and holier sort than you have known before
please present my kind regards to your afflicted mother

yours of december 29 by the hand of mr
strong is just received
the day i telegraphed you suspending the order in relation to dr
with mr
the attorney general
appeared before me and left with me a copy of the order mentioned
the doctor also showed me the copy of an oath which he said he had taken
which is indeed very strong and specific
he also verbally assured me that he had constantly prayed in church for the president and government
as he had always done before the present war
in looking over the recitals in your order
i do not see that this matter of the prayer
as he states it
is negatived
nor that any violation of his oath is charged nor
in fact
that anything specific is alleged against him
the charges are all general
that he has a rebel wife and rebel relations
that he sympathies with rebels
and that he exercises rebel influence
after talking with him
i tell you frankly i believe he does sympathize with the rebels
but the question remains whether such a man
of unquestioned good moral character
who has taken such an oath as he has
and cannot even be charged with violating it
and who can be charged with no other specific act or omission
with safety to the government
be exiled upon the suspicion of his secret sympathies
but i agree that this must be left to you
who are on the spot and if
after all
you think the public good requires his removal
my suspension of the order is withdrawn
only with this qualification
that the time during the suspension is not to be counted against him
i have promised him this
but i must add that the united states government must not
as by this order
undertake to run the churches
when an individual in a church or out of it becomes dangerous to the public interest
he must be checked but let the churches
as such
take care of themselves
it will not do for the united states to appoint trustees
or other agents for the churches

1863 major general curtis
my dear sir
i am having a good deal of trouble with missouri matters
and i now sit down to write you particularly about it
one class of friends believe in greater severity and another in greater leniency in regard to arrests
and assessments
as usual in such cases
each questions the other's motives
on the one hand
it is insisted that governor gamble's unionism
at most
is not better than a secondary spring of action that hunkerism and a wish for political influence stand before unionism with him
on the other hand
it is urged that arrests
and assessments are made more for private malice
and pecuniary interest than for the public good
this morning i was told
by a gentleman who i have no doubt believes what he says
that in one case of assessments for 10
000 the different persons who paid compared receipts
and found they had paid 30
if this be true
the inference is that the collecting agents pocketed the odd 20
and true or not in the instance
nothing but the sternest necessity can justify the making and maintaining of a system so liable to such abuses
doubtless the necessity for the making of the system in missouri did exist
and whether it continues for the maintenance of it is now a practical and very important question
some days ago governor gamble telegraphed me
asking that the assessments outside of st
louis county might be suspended
as they already have been within it
and this morning all the members of congress here from missouri but one laid a paper before me asking the same thing
my belief is that governor gamble is an honest and true man
not less so than yourself that you and he could confer together on this and other missouri questions with great advantage to the public that each knows something which the other does not and that acting together you could about double your stock of pertinent information
may i not hope that you and he will attempt this
i could at once safely do or you could safely do without me whatever you and he agree upon
there is absolutely no reason why you should not agree
yours as ever
i forgot to say that hon
james s
member of congress from one of the missouri districts
wishes that
upon his personal responsibility

of boone county
missouri and james l
also of boone county

whom he says he knows to be true men
he also says he has many constituents who he thinks are rightly exiled
but that he thinks these three should be allowed to return
please look into the case
and oblige major rollins if you consistently can

my good friends
the honorable senator harlan has just placed in my hands your letter of the 27th of december
which i have read with pleasure and gratitude
it is most cheering and encouraging for me to know that in the efforts which i have made and am making for the restoration of a righteous peace to our country
i am upheld and sustained by the good wishes and prayers of god's people
no one is more deeply than myself aware that without his favor our highest wisdom is but as foolishness and that our most strenuous efforts would avail nothing in the shadow of his displeasure
i am conscious of no desire for my country's welfare that is not in consonance with his will
and of no plan upon which we may not ask his blessing
it seems to me that if there be one subject upon which all good men may unitedly agree
it is imploring the gracious favor of the god of nations upon the struggles our people are making for the preservation of their precious birthright of civil and religious liberty

january 8
headquarters army of the potomac january 5
his excellency the president of the united states
since my return to the army i have become more than ever convinced that the general officers of this command are almost unanimously opposed to another crossing of the river but i am still of the opinion that the crossing should be attempted
and i have accordingly issued orders to the engineers and artillery to prepare for it
there is much hazard in it
as there always is in the majority of military movements
and i cannot begin the movement without giving you notice of it
particularly as i know so little of the effect that it may have upon other movements of distant armies
the influence of your telegram the other day is still upon me
and has impressed me with the idea that there are many parts of the problem which influence you that are not known to me
in order to relieve you from all embarrassment in my case
i inclose with this my resignation of my commission as major general of volunteers
which you can have accepted if my movement is not in accordance with the views of yourself and your military advisers
i have taken the liberty to write to you personally upon this subject
because it was necessary
as i learned from general halleck
for you to approve of my general plan
written at warrenton
before i could commence the movement and i think it quite as necessary that you should know of the important movement i am about to make
particularly as it will have to be made in opposition to the views of nearly all my general officers
and after the receipt of a despatch from you informing me of the opinion of some of them who had visited you
in conversation with you on new year's morning i was led to express some opinions which i afterward felt it my duty to place on paper
and to express them verbally to the gentleman of whom we were speaking
which i did in your presence
after handing you the letter
you were not disposed then
as i saw
to retain the letter
and i took it back
but i now return it to you for record if you wish it
i beg leave to say that my resignation is not sent in in any spirit of insubordination
as i before said
simply to relieve you from any embarrassment in changing commanders where lack of confidence may have rendered it necessary
the bearer of this will bring me any answer
or i should be glad to hear from you by telegraph in cipher
i have the honor to be
very respectfully
your obedient servant
commanding army of the potomac
headquarters of the army
january 7
major general burnside
your communication of the 5th was delivered to me by your aide de camp at 12 m
in all my communications and interviews with you since you took command of the army of the potomac i have advised a forward movement across the rappahannock
at our interview at warrenton i urged that you should cross by the fords above fredericksburg rather than to fall down to that place and when i left you at warrenton it was understood that at least a considerable part of your army would cross by the fords
and i so represented to the president
it was this modification of the plan proposed by you that i telegraphed you had received his approval
when the attempt at fredericksburg was abandoned
i advised you to renew the attempt at some other point
either in whole or in part
to turn the enemy's works
or to threaten their wings or communications in other words
to keep the enemy occupied till a favorable opportunity offered to strike a decisive blow
i particularly advised you to use your cavalry and light artillery upon his communications
and attempt to cut off his supplies and engage him at an advantage
in all our interviews i have urged that our first object was
not richmond
but the defeat or scattering of lee's army
which threatened washington and the line of the upper potomac
i now recur to these things simply to remind you of the general views which i have expressed
and which i still hold
the circumstances of the case
have somewhat changed since the early part of november
the chances of an extended line of operations are now
on account of the advanced season
much less than then
but the chances are still in our favor to meet and defeat the enemy on the rappahannock
if we can effect a crossing in a position where we can meet the enemy on favorable or even equal terms
i therefore still advise a movement against him
the character of that movement
must depend upon circumstances which may change any day and almost any hour
if the enemy should concentrate his forces at the place you have selected for a crossing
make it a feint and try another place
the circumstances at the time may be such as to render an attempt to cross the entire army not advisable
in that case
theory suggests that
while the enemy concentrates at that point
advantages can be gained by crossing smaller forces at other points to cut off his lines
destroy his communication
and capture his rear guards
the great object is to occupy the enemy to prevent his making large detachments or distant raids
and to injure him all you can with the least injury to yourself
if this can be best accomplished by feints of a general crossing and detached real crossings
take that course if by an actual general crossing
with feints on other points
adopt that course
there seem to me to be many reasons why a crossing at some point should be attempted
it will not do to keep your large army inactive
as you yourself admit
it devolves on you to decide upon the time
and character of the crossing which you may attempt
i can only advise that an attempt be made
and as early as possible
very respectfully
your obedient servant
january 8
general burnside
i understand general halleck has sent you a letter of which this is a copy
i approve this letter
i deplore the want of concurrence with you in opinion by your general officers
but i do not see the remedy
be cautious
and do not understand that the government or country is driving you
i do not yet see how i could profit by changing the command of the army of the potomac and if i did
i should not wish to do it by accepting the resignation of your commission

to the house of representatives
the secretary of state has submitted to me a resolution of the house of representatives of the 5th instant
which has been delivered to him
and which is in the following words
that the secretary of state be requested to communicate to this house
if not
in his judgment
incompatible with the public interest
why our minister in new granada has not presented his credentials to the actual government of that country also the reasons for which senor murillo is not recognized by the united states as the diplomatic representative of the mosquera government of that country also
what negotiations have been had
if any
with general herran as the representative of ospina's government in new granada since it went into existence
on the 12th day of december
a treaty of amity
and concord was concluded between the united states of america and the republic of new granada
which is still in force
on the 7th day of december
general pedro alcantara herran
who had been duly accredited
was received here as the envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary of that
on the 30th day of august
senor don rafael rivas was received by this government as charge d'affaires of the same republic
on the 5th day of december
a consular convention was concluded between that republic and the united states
which treaty was signed on behalf of the republic of granada by the same senor rivas
this treaty is still in force
on the 27th of april
senor don victoriano de diego paredes was received as charge d'affaires of the republic of new granada
on the 20th of june
general pedro alcantara herran was again received as envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary
duly accredited by the republic of new granada
and he has ever since remained
under the same credentials
as the representative of that republic near the government of the united states
on the 10th of september
a claims convention was concluded between the united states and the republic of granada
this convention is still in force
and has in part been executed
in may
the constitution of the republic was remodelled and the nation assumed the political title of the granadian confederacy
this fact was formally announced to this government
but without any change in their representative here
previously to the 4th day of march
a revolutionary war against the republic of new granada
which had thus been recognized and treated with by the united states
broke out in new granada
assuming to set up a new government under the name of united states of colombia
this war has had various vicissitudes
sometimes favorable
sometimes adverse
to the revolutionary movements
the revolutionary organization has hitherto been simply a military provisionary power
and no definitive constitution of government has yet been established in new granada in place of that organized by the constitution of 1858
the minister of the united states to the granadian confederacy
who was appointed on the 29th day of may
was directed
in view of the occupation of the capital by the revolutionary party and of the uncertainty of the civil war
not to present his credentials to either the government of the granadian confederacy or to the provisional military government
but to conduct his affairs informally
as is customary in such cases
and to report the progress of events and await the instructions of this government
the advices which have been received from him have not hitherto
been sufficiently conclusive to determine me to recognize the revolutionary government
general herran being here
with full authority from the government of new canada
which has been so long recognized by the united states
i have not received any representative from the revolutionary government
which has not yet been recognized
because such a proceeding would be in itself an act of recognition
official communications have been had on various incidental and occasional questions with general herran as the minister plenipotentiary and envoy extraordinary of the granadian confederacy
but in no other character
no definitive measure or proceeding has resulted from these communications
and a communication of them at present would not
in my judgment
be compatible with the public interest
to secretary of war
january 15
secretary of war
please see mr
who wants to assist in raising colored troops in missouri
printing money message to congress
january 17
to the senate and house of representatives
i have signed the joint resolution to provide for the immediate payment of the army and navy of the united states
passed by the house of representatives on the 14th and by the senate on the 15th instant
the joint resolution is a simple authority
under existing circumstances
to a direction
to the secretary of the treasury to make an additional issue of 100
000 in united states notes
if so much money is needed
for the payment of the army and navy
my approval is given in order that every possible facility may be afforded for the prompt discharge of all arrears of pay due to our soldiers and our sailors
while giving this approval
i think it my duty to express my sincere regret that it has been found necessary to authorize so large an additional issue of united states notes
when this circulation and that of the suspended banks together have become already so redundant as to increase prices beyond real values
thereby augmenting the cost of living to the injury of labor
and the cost of supplies to the injury of the whole country
it seems very plain that continued issues of united states notes without any check to the issues of suspended banks
and without adequate provision for the raising of money by loans and for funding the issues so as to keep them within due limits
must soon produce disastrous consequences and this matter appears to me so important that i feel bound to avail myself of this occasion to ask the special attention of congress to it
that congress has power to regulate the currency of the country can hardly admit of doubt
and that a judicious measure to prevent the deterioration of this currency
by a seasonable taxation of bank circulation or otherwise
is needed seems equally clear
independently of this general consideration
it would be unjust to the people at large to exempt banks enjoying the special privilege of circulation from their just proportion of the public burdens
in order to raise money by way of loans most easily and cheaply
it is clearly necessary to give every possible support to the public credit
to that end a uniform currency
in which taxes
subscriptions to loans
and all other ordinary public dues as well as all private dues may be paid
is almost if not quite indispensable
such a currency can be furnished by banking associations organized under a general act of congress
as suggested in my message at the beginning of the present session
the securing of this circulation by the pledge of united states bonds
as therein suggested
would still further facilitate loans
by increasing the present and causing a future demand for such bonds
in view of the actual financial embarrassments of the government
and of the greater embarrassment sure to come if the necessary means of relief be not afforded
i feel that i should not perform my duty by a simple announcement of my approval of the joint resolution
which proposes relief only by increased circulation
without expressing my earnest desire that measures such in substance as those i have just referred to may receive the early sanction of congress
by such measures
in my opinion
will payment be most certainly secured
not only to the army and navy
but to all honest creditors of the government
and satisfactory provision made for future demands on the treasury
to the working men of manchester
executive mansion
to the working men of manchester
i have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of the address and resolutions which you sent me on the eve of the new year
when i came
on the 4th of march
through a free and constitutional election to fireside in the government of the united states
the country was found at the verge of civil war
whatever might have been the cause
or whosesoever the fault
one duty
paramount to all others
was before me
to maintain and preserve at once the constitution and the integrity of the federal republic
a conscientious purpose to perform this duty is the key to all the measures of administration which have been and to all which will hereafter be pursued
under our frame of government and my official oath
i could not depart from this purpose if i would
it is not always in the power of governments to enlarge or restrict the scope of moral results which follow the policies that they may deem it necessary for the public safety from time to time to adopt
i have understood well that the duty of self preservation rests solely with the american people but i have at the same time been aware that favor or disfavor of foreign nations might have a material influence in enlarging or prolonging the struggle with disloyal men in which the country is engaged
a fair examination of history has served to authorize a belief that the past actions and influences of the united states were generally regarded as having been beneficial toward mankind
i have
reckoned upon the forbearance of nations
circumstances to some of which you kindly allude induce me especially to expect that if justice and good faith should be practised by the united states
they would encounter no hostile influence on the part of great britain
it is now a pleasant duty to acknowledge the demonstration you have given of your desire that a spirit of amity and peace toward this country may prevail in the councils of your queen
who is respected and esteemed in your own country only more than she is by the kindred nation which has its home on this side of the atlantic
i know and deeply deplore the sufferings which the workingmen at manchester
and in all europe
are called to endure in this crisis
it has been often and studiously represented that the attempt to overthrow this government
which was built upon the foundation of human rights
and to substitute for it one which should rest exclusively on the basis of human slavery
was likely to obtain the favor of europe
through the action of our disloyal citizens
the working men of europe have been subjected to severe trials
for the purpose of forcing their sanction to that attempt
under the circumstance
i cannot but regard your decisive utterances upon the question as an instance of sublime christian heroism which has not been surpassed in any age or in any country
it is indeed an energetic and inspiring assurance of the inherent power of truth and of the ultimate and universal triumph of justice
and freedom
i do not doubt that the sentiments
you have expressed will be sustained by your great nation and
on the other hand
i have no hesitation in assuring you that they will excite admiration
and the most reciprocal feelings of friendship among the american people
i hail this interchange of sentiment
as an augury that whatever else may happen
whatever misfortune may befall your country or my own
the peace and friendship which now exist between the two nations will be
as it shall be my desire to make them

the president has directed that so much of arkansas as you may desire to control be temporarily attached to your department
this will give you control of both banks of the river
in your operations down the mississippi you must not rely too confidently upon any direct co operation of general banks and the lower flotilla
as it is possible that they may not be able to pass or reduce port hudson
will do everything in their power to form a junction with you at vicksburg
if they should not be able to effect this
they will at least occupy a portion of the enemy's forces
and prevent them from reinforcing vicksburg
i hope
that they will do still better and be able to join you
it may be proper to give you some explanation of the revocation of your order expelling all jews from your department
the president has no objection to your expelling traitors and jew peddlers
i suppose
was the object of your order but as it in terms proscribed an entire religious class
some of whom are fighting in our ranks
the president deemed it necessary to revoke it
very respectfully

major general hooker
i have placed you at the head of the army of the potomac
of course i have done this upon what appear to me to be sufficient reasons
and yet i think it best for you to know that there are some things in regard to which i am not quite satisfied with you
i believe you to be a brave and skillful soldier
which of course i like
i also believe you do not mix politics with your profession
in which you are right
you have confidence in yourself
which is a valuable if not an indispensable quality
you are ambitious
which within reasonable bounds does good rather than harm but i think that during general burnside's command of the army you have taken counsel of your ambition and thwarted him as much as you could
in which you did a great wrong to the country and to a most meritorious and honorable brother officer
i have heard
in such a way as to believe it
of your recently saying that both the army and the government needed a dictator
of course it was not for this
but in spite of it
that i have given you the command
only those generals who gain successes can set up dictators
what i now ask of you is military success
and i will risk the dictatorship
the government will support you to the utmost of its ability
which is neither more nor less than it has done and will do for all commanders
i much fear that the spirit that you have aided to infuse into the army
of criticizing their commander and withholding confidence from him
will now turn upon you
i shall assist you as far as i can to put it down
neither you nor napoleon
if he were alive again
could get any good out of an army while such a spirit prevails in it
and now beware of rashness
beware of rashness
but with energy and sleepless vigilance go forward and give us victories

commander george henry preble
united states navy
then senior officer in command of the naval force off the harbor of mobile
was guilty of inexcusable neglect in permitting the armed steamer oreto in open daylight to run the blockade
for his omission to perform his whole duty on that occasion
and the injury thereby inflicted on the service and the country
his name was stricken from the list of naval officers and he was dismissed from the service
since his dismissal earnest application has been made for his restoration to his former position by senators and naval officers
on the ground that his fault was an error of judgment
and that the example in his case has already had its effect in preventing a repetition of similar neglect
i therefore on this application and representation
and in consideration of his previous fair record
do hereby nominate george henry preble to be a commander in the navy from the 16th july

i mean that of an eminent citizen of a slave state and himself a slaveholder
the colored population is the great available and yet unavailed of force for restoring the union

proclamation appointing a national fast day
by the president of the united states of america
a proclamation
march 30
whereas the senate of the united states
devoutly recognizing the supreme authority and just government of almighty god in all the affairs of men and of nations
has by a resolution requested the president to designate and set apart a day for national prayer and humiliation
and whereas it is the duty of nations as well as men to own their dependence upon the overruling power of god to confess their sins and transgressions in humble sorrow
yet with assured hope that genuine repentance will lead to mercy and pardon and to recognize the sublime truth
announced in the holy scriptures and proven by all history
that those nations only are blessed whose god is the lord
and insomuch as we know that by his divine law nations
like individuals
are subjected to punishments and chastisements in this world
may we not justly fear that the awful calamity of civil war which now desolates the land may be but a punishment inflicted upon us for our presumptuous sins
to the needful end of our national reformation as a whole people
we have been the recipients of the choicest bounties of heaven
we have been preserved
these many years
in peace and prosperity
we have grown in numbers
and power as no other nation has ever grown but we have forgotten god
we have forgotten the gracious hand which preserved us in peace
and multiplied and enriched and strengthened us and we have vainly imagined
in the deceitfulness of our hearts
that all these blessings were produced by some superior wisdom and virtue of our own
intoxicated with unbroken success
we have become too self sufficient to feel the necessity of redeeming and preserving grace
too proud to pray to the god that made us
it behooves us
to humble ourselves before the offended power
to confess our national sins
and to pray for clemency and forgiveness
in compliance with the request
and fully concurring in the views
of the senate
i do by this my proclamation designate and set apart thursday
the 30th day of april
as a day of national humiliation
and prayer
and i do hereby request all the people to abstain on that day from their ordinary secular pursuits
and to unite at their several places of public worship and their respective homes in keeping the day holy to the lord
and devoted to the humble discharge of the religious duties proper to that solemn occasion
all this being done in sincerity and truth
let us then rest humbly in the hope
authorized by the divine teachings
that the united cry of the nation will be heard on high
and answered with blessings no less than the pardon of our national sins
and the restoration of our now divided and suffering country to its former happy condition of unity and peace
in witness whereof
i have hereunto set my hand

entitled an act to provide for the collection of duties on imports

except as the same shall be licensed and permitted by the president to be conducted and carried on only in pursuance of rules and regulations prescribed by the secretary of the treasury and
whereas it appears that a partial restoration of such intercourse between the inhabitants of sundry places and sections heretofore declared in insurrection in pursuance of said act and the citizens of the rest of the united states will favorably affect the public interests

exercising the authority and discretion confided to me by the said act of congress

opinion on harbor defense
april 4
on this general subject i respectfully refer mr
to the secretaries of war and navy for conference and consultation
i have a single idea of my own about harbor defense
it is a steam ram
built so as to sacrifice nearly all capacity for carrying to those of speed and strength
so as to be able to split any vessel having hollow enough in her to carry supplies for a voyage of any distance
such ram
of course
could not herself carry supplies for a voyage of considerable distance
and her business would be to guard a particular harbor as a bulldog guards his master's door

richmond whig of the 8th has no telegraphic despatches from charleston
but has the following as editorial
all thoughts are now centred upon charleston
official intelligence was made public early yesterday morning that the enemy's iron clad fleet had attempted to cross the bar and failed
but later in the day it was announced that the gunboats and transports had succeeded in crossing and were at anchor
our iron clads lay between the forts quietly awaiting the attack
further intelligence is looked for with eager anxiety
the yankees have made no secret of this vast preparation for an attack on charleston
and we may well anticipate a desperate conflict
at last the hour of trial has come for charleston
the hour of deliverance or destruction
for no one believes the other alternative
the heart of the whole country yearns toward the beleaguered city with intense solicitude
yet with hopes amounting to confidence
charleston knows what is expected of her
and which is due to her fame
and to the relation she sustains to the cause
the devoted
the heroic
the great hearted beauregard is there
and he
knows what is expected of him and will not disappoint that expectation
we predict a saragossa defense
and that if charleston is taken it will be only a heap of ruins
the rebel pickets are reported as calling over to our pickets today that we had taken some rebel fort
this is not very intelligible
and i think is entirely unreliable

hold your position inside the bar near charleston or
if you shall have left it
return to it
and hold it until further orders
do not allow the enemy to erect new batteries or defenses on morris island
if he has begun it
drive him out
i do not herein order you to renew the general attack
that is to depend on your own discretion or a further order

general hunter and admiral dupont
this is intended to clear up an apparent inconsistency between the recent order to continue operations before charleston and the former one to remove to another point in a certain contingency
no censure upon you
or either of you
is intended
we still hope that by cordial and judicious co operation you can take the batteries on morris island and sullivan's island and fort sumter
but whether you can or not
we wish the demonstration kept up for a time
for a collateral and very important object
we wish the attempt to be a real one
though not a desperate one
if it affords any considerable chance of success
but if prosecuted as a demonstration only
this must not become public
or the whole effect will be lost
once again before charleston
do not leave until further orders from here
of course this is not intended to force you to leave unduly exposed hilton head or other near points in your charge
yours truly
whoever receives this first

general s
is not moving rapidly enough to make the expedition come to anything
he has now been out three days
two of which were unusually fair weather
and all three without hindrance from the enemy
and yet he is not twenty five miles from where he started
to reach his point he still has sixty to go
another river the rapidan to cross
and will be hindered by the enemy
by arithmetic
how many days will it take him to do it
i do not know that any better can be done
but i greatly fear it is another failure already
write me often

the whole disposable force at baltimore and else where in reach have already been sent after the enemy which alarms you
the worst thing the enemy could do for himself would be to weaken himself before hooker
and therefore it is safe to believe he is not doing it and the best thing he could do for himself would be to get us so scared as to bring part of hooker's force away
and that is just what he is trying to do
i will telegraph you in the morning about calling out the militia

my dear sir
the recent movement of your army is ended without effecting its object
some important breakings of the enemy's communications
what next
if possible
i would be very glad of another movement early enough to give us some benefit from the fact of the enemy's communication being broken but neither for this reason nor any other do i wish anything done in desperation or rashness
an early movement would also help to supersede the bad moral effect of there certain
which is said to be considerably injurious
have you already in your mind a plan wholly or partially formed
if you have
prosecute it without interference from me
if you have not
please inform me
so that i
incompetent as i may be
can try and assist in the formation of some plan for the army

drafting of aliens proclamation concerning aliens
may 8
by the president of the united states of america
a proclamation whereas the congress of the united states
at its last session
enacted a law entitled an act for enrolling and calling out the national forces and for other purposes
which was approved on the 3d day of march last and whereas it is recited in the said act that there now exists in the united states an insurrection and rebellion against the authority thereof
and it is
under the constitution of the united states
the duty of the government to suppress insurrection and rebellion
to guarantee to each state a republican form of government
and to preserve the public tranquillity and whereas for these high purposes a military force is indispensable
to raise and support which all persons ought willingly to contribute and whereas no service can be more praiseworthy and honorable than that which is rendered for the maintenance of the constitution and the union
and the consequent preservation of free government and whereas
for the reasons thus recited
it was enacted by the said statute that all able bodied male citizens of the united states
and persons of foreign birth who shall have declared on oath their intention to become citizens under and in pursuance of the laws thereof
between the ages of twenty and forty five years with certain exceptions not necessary to be here mentioned
are declared to constitute the national forces
and shall be liable to perform military duty in the service of the united states when called out by the president for that purpose and whereas it is claimed by and in behalf of persons of foreign birth within the ages specified in said act
who have heretofore declared on oath their intentions to become citizens under and in pursuance of the laws of the united states
and who have not exercised the right of suffrage or any other political franchise under the laws of the united states
or of any of the states thereof
that they are not absolutely concluded by their aforesaid declaration of intention from renouncing their purpose to become citizens
and that
on the contrary
such persons under treaties or the law of nations retain a right to renounce that purpose and to forego the privileges of citizenship and residence within the united states under the obligations imposed by the aforesaid act of congress
to avoid all misapprehensions concerning the liability of persons concerned to perform the service required by such enactment
and to give it full effect
i do hereby order and proclaim that no plea of alienage will be received or allowed to exempt from the obligations imposed by the aforesaid act of congress any person of foreign birth who shall have declared on oath his intention to become a citizen of the united states under the laws thereof
and who shall be found within the united states at any time during the continuance of the present insurrection and rebellion
at or after the expiration of the period of sixty five days from the date of this proclamation nor shall any such plea of alienage be allowed in favor of any such person who has so
as aforesaid
declared his intention to become a citizen of the united states
and shall have exercised at any time the right of suffrage
or any other political franchise
within the united states
under the laws thereof
or under the laws of any of the several states

major general hooker
my dear sir
when i wrote on the 7th
i had an impression that possibly by an early movement you could get some advantage from the supposed facts that the enemy's communications were disturbed and that he was somewhat deranged in position
that idea has now passed away
the enemy having re established his communications
regained his positions
and actually received reinforcements
it does not now appear probable to me that you can gain anything by an early renewal of the attempt to cross the rappahannock
i therefore shall not complain if you do no more for a time than to keep the enemy at bay and out of other mischief by menaces and occasional cavalry raids
if practicable
and to put your own army in good condition again
if in your own clear judgment you can renew the attack successfully
i do not mean to restrain you
bearing upon this last point
i must tell you that i have some painful intimations that some of your corps and division commanders are not giving you their entire confidence
this would be ruinous
if true
and you should therefore
first of all
ascertain the real facts beyond all possibility of doubt

my dear sir
having relieved general curtis and assigned you to the command of the department of the missouri
i think it may be of some advantage for me to state why i did it
i did not relieve general curtis because of any full conviction that he had done wrong by commission or omission
i did it because of a conviction in my mind that the union men of missouri
when united
a vast majority of the whole people
have entered into a pestilent factional quarrel among themselves general curtis
perhaps not of choice
being the head of one faction and governor gamble that of the other
after months of labor to reconcile the difficulty
it seemed to grow worse and worse
until i felt it my duty to break it up somehow and as i could not remove governor gamble
i had to remove general curtis
now that you are in the position
i wish you to undo nothing merely because general curtis or governor gamble did it
but to exercise your own judgment
and do right for the public interest
let your military measures be strong enough to repel the invader and keep the peace
and not so strong as to unnecessarily harass and persecute the people
it is a difficult role
and so much greater will be the honor if you perform it well
if both factions
or neither
shall abuse you
you will probably be about right
beware of being assailed by one and praised by the other

yours of to day was received an hour ago
so much of professional military skill is requisite to answer it that i have turned the task over to general halleck
he promises to perform it with his utmost care
i have but one idea which i think worth suggesting to you
and that is
in case you find lee coming to the north of the rappahannock
i would by no means cross to the south of it
if he should leave a rear force at fredericksburg
tempting you to fall upon it
it would fight in entrenchments and have you at advantage
and so
man for man
worst you at that point
while his main force would in some way be getting an advantage of you northward
in one word
i would not take any risk of being entangled up on the river like an ox jumped half over a fence and liable to be torn by dogs front and rear without a fair chance to gore one way or to kick the other
if lee would come to my side of the river i would keep on the same side and fight him
or act on the defensive
according as might be my estimate of his strength relatively to my own
but these are mere suggestions
which i desire to be controlled by the judgment of yourself and general halleck

your letter of may 19
inclosing the resolutions of a public meeting held at albany
new york
on the 16th of the same month
was received several days ago
the resolutions
as i understand them
are resolvable into two propositions first
the expression of a purpose to sustain the cause of the union
to secure peace through victory
and to support the administration in every constitutional and lawful measure to suppress the rebellion and
a declaration of censure upon the administration for supposed unconstitutional action
such as the making of military arrests
and from the two propositions a third is deduced
which is that the gentlemen composing the meeting are resolved on doing their part to maintain our common government and country
despite the folly or wickedness
as they may conceive
of any administration
this position is eminently patriotic
and as such i thank the meeting
and congratulate the nation for it
my own purpose is the same so that the meeting and myself have a common object
and can have no difference
except in the choice of means or measures for effecting that object
and here i ought to close this paper
and would close it
if there were no apprehension that more injurious consequences than any merely personal to myself might follow the censures systematically cast upon me for doing what
in my view of duty
i could not forbear
the resolutions promise to support me in every constitutional and lawful measure to suppress the rebellion and i have not knowingly employed
nor shall knowingly employ
any other
but the meeting
by their resolutions
assert and argue that certain military arrests
and proceedings following them
for which i am ultimately responsible
are unconstitutional
i think they are not
the resolutions quote from the constitution the definition of treason
and also the limiting safeguards and guarantees therein provided for the citizen on trial for treason
and on his being held to answer for capital or otherwise infamous crimes
and in criminal prosecutions his right to a speedy and public trial by an impartial jury
they proceed to resolve that these safeguards of the rights of the citizen against the pretensions of arbitrary power were intended more especially for his protection in times of civil commotion
and
apparently to demonstrate the proposition
the resolutions proceed
they were secured substantially to the english people after years of protracted civil war
and were adopted into our constitution at the close of the revolution
would not the demonstration have been better if it could have been truly said that these safeguards had been adopted and applied during the civil wars and during our revolution
instead of after the one and at the close of the other
i too am devotedly for them after civil war
and before civil war
and at all times
except when
in cases of rebellion or invasion
the public safety may require their suspension
the resolutions proceed to tell us that these safeguards have stood the test of seventy six years of trial under our republican system
under circumstances which show that
while they constitute the foundation of all free government
they are the elements of the enduring stability of the republic
no one denies that they have so stood the test up to the beginning of the present rebellion
if we except a certain occurrence at new orleans hereafter to be mentioned nor does any one question that they will stand the same test much longer after the rebellion closes
but these provisions of the constitution have no application to the case we have in hand
because the arrests complained of were not made for treason that is
not for the treason defined in the constitution
and upon the conviction of which the punishment is death nor yet were they made to hold persons to answer for any capital or otherwise infamous crimes nor were the proceedings following
in any constitutional or legal sense
criminal prosecutions
the arrests were made on totally different grounds
and the proceedings following accorded with the grounds of the arrests
let us consider the real case with which we are dealing
and apply to it the parts of the constitution plainly made for such cases
prior to my installation here it had been inculcated that any state had a lawful right to secede from the national union
and that it would be expedient to exercise the right whenever the devotees of the doctrine should fail to elect a president to their own liking
i was elected contrary to their liking and accordingly
so far as it was legally possible
they had taken seven states out of the union
had seized many of the united states forts
and had fired upon the united states flag
all before i was inaugurated
of course
before i had done any official act whatever
the rebellion thus begun soon ran into the present civil war and
in certain respects
it began on very unequal terms between the parties
the insurgents had been preparing for it more than thirty years
while the government had taken no steps to resist them
the former had carefully considered all the means which could be turned to their account
it undoubtedly was a well pondered reliance with them that in their own unrestricted effort to destroy union
constitution and law
all together
the government would
in great degree
be restrained by the same constitution and law from arresting their progress
their sympathizers invaded all departments of the government and nearly all communities of the people
from this material
under cover of liberty of speech
liberty of the press
and habeas corpus
they hoped to keep on foot amongst us a most efficient corps of spies
and aiders and abettors of their cause in a thousand ways
they knew that in times such as they were inaugurating
by the constitution itself the habeas corpus might be suspended but they also knew they had friends who would make a question as to who was to suspend it meanwhile their spies and others might remain at large to help on their cause
or if
as has happened
the executive should suspend the writ without ruinous waste of time
instances of arresting innocent persons might occur
as are always likely to occur in such cases and then a clamor could be raised in regard to this
which might be at least of some service to the insurgent cause
it needed no very keen perception to discover this part of the enemies program
so soon as by open hostilities their machinery was fairly put in motion
thoroughly imbued with a reverence for the guaranteed rights of individuals
i was slow to adopt the strong measures which by degrees i have been forced to regard as being within the exceptions of the constitution
and as indispensable to the public safety
nothing is better known to history than that courts of justice are utterly incompetent to such cases
civil courts are organized chiefly for trials of individuals or
at most
a few individuals acting in concert
and this in quiet times
and on charges of crimes well defined in the law
even in times of peace bands of horse thieves and robbers frequently grow too numerous and powerful for the ordinary courts of justice
but what comparison
in numbers have such bands ever borne to the insurgent sympathizers even in many of the loyal states
a jury too frequently has at least one member more ready to hang the panel than to hang the traitor
and yet again
he who dissuades one man from volunteering
or induces one soldier to desert
weakens the union cause as much as he who kills a union soldier in battle
yet this dissuasion or inducement may be so conducted as to be no defined crime of which any civil court would take cognizance
ours is a case of rebellion so called by the resolutions before me in fact
a clear
and gigantic case of rebellion and the provision of the constitution that the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended unless when
in cases of rebellion or invasion
the public safety may require it
is the provision which specially applies to our present case
this provision plainly attests the understanding of those who made the constitution that ordinary courts of justice are inadequate to cases of rebellion attests their purpose that
in such cases
men may be held in custody whom the courts
acting on ordinary rules
would discharge
habeas corpus does not discharge men who are proved to be guilty of defined crime
and its suspension is allowed by the constitution on purpose that men may be arrested and held who can not be proved to be guilty of defined crime
in cases of rebellion or invasion
the public safety may require it
this is precisely our present case a case of rebellion wherein the public safety does require the suspension indeed
arrests by process of courts and arrests in cases of rebellion do not proceed altogether upon the same basis
the former is directed at the small percentage of ordinary and continuous perpetration of crime
while the latter is directed at sudden and extensive uprisings against the government
at most
will succeed or fail in no great length of time
in the latter case arrests are made not so much for what has been done as for what probably would be done
the latter is more for the preventive and less for the vindictive than the former
in such cases the purposes of men are much more easily understood than in cases of ordinary crime
the man who stands by and says nothing when the peril of his government is discussed
cannot be misunderstood
if not hindered
he is sure to help the enemy much more if he talks ambiguously talks for his country with buts
and ifs
and ands
of how little value the constitutional provision i have quoted will be rendered if arrests shall never be made until defined crimes shall have been committed
may be illustrated by a few notable examples
general john c
general robert e
general joseph e
general john b
general william b
general simon b
and commodore franklin buchanan
now occupying the very highest places in the rebel war service
were all within the power of the government since the rebellion began
and were nearly as well known to be traitors then as now
unquestionably if we had seized and had them the insurgent cause would be much weaker
but no one of them had then committed any crime defined in the law
every one of them
if arrested
would have been discharged on habeas corpus were the writ allowed to operate
in view of these and similar cases
i think the time not unlikely to come when i shall be blamed for having made too few arrests rather than too many
by the third resolution the meeting indicate their opinion that military arrests may be constitutional in localities where rebellion actually exists
but that such arrests are unconstitutional in localities where rebellion or insurrection does not actually exist
they insist that such arrests shall not be made outside of the lines of necessary military occupation and the scenes of insurrection
inasmuch
as the constitution itself makes no such distinction
i am unable to believe that there is any such constitutional distinction
i concede that the class of arrests complained of can be constitutional only when
in cases of rebellion or invasion
the public safety may require them and i insist that in such cases they are constitutional wherever the public safety does require them
as well in places to which they may prevent the rebellion extending
as in those where it may be already prevailing as well where they may restrain mischievous interference with the raising and supplying of armies to suppress the rebellion as where the rebellion may actually be as well where they may restrain the enticing men out of the army as where they would prevent mutiny in the army equally constitutional at all places where they will conduce to the public safety as against the dangers of rebellion or invasion
take the particular case mentioned by the meeting
it is asserted in substance that mr
vallandigham was
by a military commander
seized and tried for no other reason than words addressed to a public meeting in criticism of the course of the administration
and in condemnation of the military orders of the general
now
if there be no mistake about this
if this assertion is the truth
and the whole truth
if there were no other reason for the arrest
then i concede that the arrest was wrong
but the arrest
as i understand
was made for a very different reason
vallandigham avows his hostility to the war on the part of the union and his arrest was made because he was laboring
with some effect
to prevent the raising of troops
to encourage desertions from the army
and to leave the rebellion without an adequate military force to suppress it
he was not arrested because he was damaging the political prospects of the administration or the personal interests of the commanding general
but because he was damaging the army
upon the existence and vigor of which the life of the nation depends
he was warring upon the military
and thus gave the military constitutional jurisdiction to lay hands upon him
if mr
vallandigham was not damaging the military power of the country
then his arrest was made on mistake of fact
which i would be glad to correct on reasonably satisfactory evidence
i understand the meeting whose resolutions i am considering to be in favor of suppressing the rebellion by military force by armies
long experience has shown that armies cannot be maintained unless desertion shall be punished by the severe penalty of death
the case requires
and the law and the constitution sanction
this punishment
must i shoot a simple minded boy and not touch a hair of a wily agitator who induced him to desert
this is none the less injurious when effected by getting a father
or brother
or friend into a public meeting
and there working upon his feelings till he is persuaded to write the soldier boy that he is fighting in a bad cause
for a wicked administration of a contemptible government
too weak to arrest and punish him if he shall desert
i think that
in such a case
to silence the agitator and save the boy is not only constitutional
but withal a great mercy
if i be wrong on this question of constitutional power
my error lies in believing that certain proceedings are constitutional when
in cases of rebellion or invasion
the public safety requires them
which would not be constitutional when
in absence of rebellion or invasion
the public safety does not require them
in other words
that the constitution is not in its application in all respects the same in cases of rebellion or invasion involving the public safety as it is in times of profound peace and public security
the constitution itself makes the distinction
and i can no more be persuaded that the government can constitutionally take no strong measures in time of rebellion
because it can be shown that the same could not be lawfully taken in times of peace
than i can be persuaded that a particular drug is not good medicine for a sick man because it can be shown to not be good food for a well one
nor am i able to appreciate the danger apprehended by the meeting
that the american people will by means of military arrests during the rebellion lose the right of public discussion
the liberty of speech and the press
the law of evidence
trial by jury
and habeas corpus throughout the indefinite peaceful future which i trust lies before them
any more than i am able to believe that a man could contract so strong an appetite for emetics during temporary illness as to persist in feeding upon them during the remainder of his healthful life
in giving the resolutions that earnest consideration which you request of me
i cannot overlook the fact that the meeting speak as democrats
nor can i
with full respect for their known intelligence
and the fairly presumed deliberation with which they prepared their resolutions
be permitted to suppose that this occurred by accident
or in any way other than that they preferred to designate themselves democrats rather than american citizens
in this time of national peril i would have preferred to meet you upon a level one step higher than any party platform
because i am sure that from such more elevated position we could do better battle for the country we all love than we possibly can from those lower ones where
from the force of habit
the prejudices of the past
and selfish hopes of the future
we are sure to expend much of our ingenuity and strength in finding fault with and aiming blows at each other
but since you have denied me this i will yet be thankful for the country's sake that not all democrats have done so
he on whose discretionary judgment mr
vallandigham was arrested and tried is a democrat
having no old party affinity with me
and the judge who rejected the constitutional view expressed in these resolutions
by refusing to discharge mr
vallandigham on habeas corpus is a democrat of better days than these
having received his judicial mantle at the hands of president jackson
and still more
of all those democrats who are nobly exposing their lives and shedding their blood on the battle field
i have learned that many approve the course taken with mr
while i have not heard of a single one condemning it
i cannot assert that there are none such
and the name of president jackson recalls an instance of pertinent history
after the battle of new orleans
and while the fact that the treaty of peace had been concluded was well known in the city
but before official knowledge of it had arrived
general jackson still maintained martial or military law
now that it could be said that the war was over
the clamor against martial law
which had existed from the first
grew more furious
among other things
a mr
louaillier published a denunciatory newspaper article
general jackson arrested him
a lawyer by the name of morel procured the united states judge hall to order a writ of habeas corpus to release mr
general jackson arrested both the lawyer and the judge
a mr
hollander ventured to say of some part of the matter that it was a dirty trick
general jackson arrested him
when the officer undertook to serve the writ of habeas corpus
general jackson took it from him
and sent him away with a copy
holding the judge in custody a few days
the general sent him beyond the limits of his encampment
and set him at liberty with an order to remain till the ratification of peace should be regularly announced
or until the british should have left the southern coast
a day or two more elapsed
the ratification of the treaty of peace was regularly announced
and the judge and others were fully liberated
a few days more
and the judge called general jackson into court and fined him 1000 for having arrested him and the others named
the general paid the fine
and then the matter rested for nearly thirty years
when congress refunded principal and interest
the late senator douglas
then in the house of representatives
took a leading part in the debates
in which the constitutional question was much discussed
i am not prepared to say whom the journals would show to have voted for the measure
it may be remarked first
that we had the same constitution then as now secondly
that we then had a case of invasion
and now we have a case of rebellion and
that the permanent right of the people to public discussion
the liberty of speech and of the press
the trial by jury
the law of evidence
and the habeas corpus suffered no detriment whatever by that conduct of general jackson
or its subsequent approval by the american congress
and yet
let me say that
in my own discretion
i do not know whether i would have ordered the arrest of mr
while i cannot shift the responsibility from myself
i hold that
as a general rule
the commander in the field is the better judge of the necessity in any particular case
of course i must practice a general directory and revisory power in the matter
one of the resolutions expresses the opinion of the meeting that arbitrary arrests will have the effect to divide and distract those who should be united in suppressing the rebellion
and i am specifically called on to discharge mr
i regard this as
at least
a fair appeal to me on the expediency of exercising a constitutional power which i think exists
in response to such appeal i have to say
it gave me pain when i learned that mr
vallandigham had been arrested that is
i was pained that there should have seemed to be a necessity for arresting him
and that it will afford me great pleasure to discharge him so soon as i can by any means believe the public safety will not suffer by it
i further say that
as the war progresses
it appears to me
opinion and action
which were in great confusion at first
take shape and fall into more regular channels
so that the necessity for strong dealing with them gradually decreases
i have every reason to desire that it should cease altogether
and far from the least is my regard for the opinions and wishes of those who
like the meeting at albany
declare their purpose to sustain the government in every constitutional and lawful measure to suppress the rebellion
i must continue to do so much as may seem to be required by the public safety

your letter
which follows
has been received and considered
the undersigned
a committee appointed by the planters of the state of louisiana
respectfully represent that they have been delegated to seek of the general government a full recognition of all the rights of the state as they existed previous to the passage of an act of secession
upon the principle of the existence of the state constitution unimpaired
and no legal act having transpired that could in any way deprive them of the advantages conferred by that constitution
under this constitution the state wishes to return to its full allegiance
in the enjoyment of all rights and privileges exercised by the other states under the federal constitution
with the view of accomplishing the desired object
we further request that your excellency will
as commander in chief of the army of the united states
direct the military governor of louisiana to order an election
in conformity with the constitution and laws of the state
on the first monday of november next
for all state and federal officers
with high consideration and resect
we have the honor to subscribe ourselves
your obedient servants
bradish johnson
thomas cottman
since receiving the letter
reliable information has reached me that a respectable portion of the louisiana people desire to amend their state constitution
and contemplate holding a state convention for that object
this fact alone
as it seems to me
is a sufficient reason why the general government should not give the committal you seek to the existing state constitution
i may add that
while i do not perceive how such committal could facilitate our military operations in louisiana
i really apprehend it might be so used as to embarrass them
as to an election to be held next november
there is abundant time without any order or proclamation from me just now
the people of louisiana shall not lack an opportunity for a fair election for both federal and state officers by want of anything within my power to give them
your obedient servant

general john m
my dear sir
your despatch
asking in substance whether
in case missouri shall adopt gradual emancipation
the general government will protect slave owners in that species of property during the short time it shall be permitted by the state to exist within it
has been received
desirous as i am that emancipation shall be adopted by missouri
and believing as i do that gradual can be made better than immediate for both black and white
except when military necessity changes the case
my impulse is to say that such protection would be given
i cannot know exactly what shape an act of emancipation may take
if the period from the initiation to the final end should be comparatively short
and the act should prevent persons being sold during that period into more lasting slavery
the whole would be easier
i do not wish to pledge the general government to the affirmative support of even temporary slavery beyond what can be fairly claimed under the constitution
i suppose
this is not desired
but that it is desired for the military force of the united states
while in missouri
to not be used in subverting the temporarily reserved legal rights in slaves during the progress of emancipation
this i would desire also
i have very earnestly urged the slave states to adopt emancipation and it ought to be
and is
an object with me not to overthrow or thwart what any of them may in good faith do to that end
you are therefore authorized to act in the spirit of this letter in conjunction with what may appear to be the military necessities of your department
although this letter will become public at some time
it is not intended to be made so now

david a
et al
the resolutions of the ohio democratic state convention
which you present me
together with your introductory and closing remarks
being in position and argument mainly the same as the resolutions of the democratic meeting at albany
new york
i refer you to my response to the latter as meeting most of the points in the former
this response you evidently used in preparing your remarks
and i desire no more than that it be used with accuracy
in a single reading of your remarks
i only discovered one inaccuracy in matter
which i suppose you took from that paper
it is where you say
the undersigned are unable to agree with you in the opinion you have expressed that the constitution is different in time of insurrection or invasion from what it is in time of peace and public security
a recurrence to the paper will show you that i have not expressed the opinion you suppose
i expressed the opinion that the constitution is different in its application in cases of rebellion or invasion
involving the public safety
from what it is in times of profound peace and public security and this opinion i adhere to
simply because
by the constitution itself
things may be done in the one case which may not be done in the other
i dislike to waste a word on a merely personal point
but i must respectfully assure you that you will find yourselves at fault should you ever seek for evidence to prove your assumption that i opposed in discussions before the people the policy of the mexican war
you say
expunge from the constitution this limitation upon the power of congress to suspend the writ of habeas corpus
and yet the other guarantees of personal liberty would remain unchanged
doubtless
if this clause of the constitution
improperly called
as i think
a limitation upon the power of congress
were expunged
the other guarantees would remain the same but the question is not how those guarantees would stand with that clause out of the constitution
but how they stand with that clause remaining in it
in case of rebellion or invasion involving the public safety
if the liberty could be indulged of expunging that clause
letter and spirit
i really think the constitutional argument would be with you
my general view on this question was stated in the albany response
and hence i do not state it now
i only add that
as seems to me
the benefit of the writ of habeas corpus is the great means through which the guarantees of personal liberty are conserved and made available in the last resort and corroborative of this view is the fact that mr
in the very case in question
under the advice of able lawyers
saw not where else to go but to the habeas corpus
but by the constitution the benefit of the writ of habeas corpus itself may be suspended when
in case of rebellion or invasion
the public safety may require it
you ask
in substance
whether i really claim that i may override all the guaranteed rights of individuals
on the plea of conserving the public safety when i may choose to say the public safety requires it
this question
divested of the phraseology calculated to represent me as struggling for an arbitrary personal prerogative
is either simply a question who shall decide
or an affirmation that nobody shall decide
what the public safety does require in cases of rebellion or invasion
the constitution contemplates the question as likely to occur for decision
but it does not expressly declare who is to decide it
by necessary implication
when rebellion or invasion comes
the decision is to be made from time to time and i think the man whom
for the time
the people have
under the constitution
made the commander in chief of their army and navy
is the man who holds the power and bears the responsibility of making it
if he uses the power justly
the same people will probably justify him if he abuses it
he is in their hands to be dealt with by all the modes they have reserved to themselves in the constitution
the earnestness with which you insist that persons can only
in times of rebellion
be lawfully dealt with in accordance with the rules for criminal trials and punishments in times of peace
induces me to add a word to what i said on that point in the albany response
you claim that men may
if they choose
embarrass those whose duty it is to combat a giant rebellion
and then be dealt with in turn only as if there were no rebellion
the constitution itself rejects this view
the military arrests and detentions which have been made
including those of mr
which are not different in principle from the others
have been for prevention
and not for punishment as injunctions to stay injury
as proceedings to keep the peace and hence
like proceedings in such cases and for like reasons
they have not been accompanied with indictments
or trials by juries
nor in a single case by any punishment whatever
beyond what is purely incidental to the prevention
the original sentence of imprisonment in mr
vallandigham's case was to prevent injury to the military service only
and the modification of it was made as a less disagreeable mode to him of securing the same prevention
i am unable to perceive an insult to ohio in the case of mr
quite surely nothing of the sort was or is intended
i was wholly unaware that mr
vallandigham was
at the time of his arrest
a candidate for the democratic nomination for governor until so informed by your reading to me the resolutions of the convention
i am grateful to the state of ohio for many things
especially for the brave soldiers and officers she has given in the present national trial to the armies of the union
you claim
as i understand
that according to my own position in the albany response
vallandigham should be released and this because
as you claim
he has not damaged the military service by discouraging enlistments
encouraging desertions
or otherwise and that if he had
he should have been turned over to the civil authorities under the recent acts of congress
i certainly do not know that mr
vallandigham has specifically and by direct language advised against enlistments and in favor of desertion and resistance to drafting
we all know that combinations
armed in some instances
to resist the arrest of deserters began several months ago that more recently the like has appeared in resistance to the enrolment preparatory to a draft and that quite a number of assassinations have occurred from the same animus
these had to be met by military force
and this again has led to bloodshed and death
and now
under a sense of responsibility more weighty and enduring than any which is merely official
i solemnly declare my belief that this hindrance of the military
including maiming and murder
is due to the course in which mr
vallandigham has been engaged in a greater degree than to any other cause and it is due to him personally in a greater degree than to any other one man
these things have been notorious
known to all
and of course known to mr
perhaps i would not be wrong to say they originated with his special friends and adherents
with perfect knowledge of them
he has frequently if not constantly made speeches in congress and before popular assemblies and if it can be shown that
with these things staring him in the face he has ever uttered a word of rebuke or counsel against them
it will be a fact greatly in his favor with me
and one of which as yet i am totally ignorant
when it is known that the whole burden of his speeches has been to stir up men against the prosecution of the war
and that in the midst of resistance to it he has not been known in any instance to counsel against such resistance
it is next to impossible to repel the inference that he has counseled directly in favor of it
with all this before their eyes
the convention you represent have nominated mr
vallandigham for governor of ohio
and both they and you have declared the purpose to sustain the national union by all constitutional means
but of course they and you in common reserve to yourselves to decide what are constitutional means and
unlike the albany meeting
you omit to state or intimate that in your opinion an army is a constitutional means of saving the union against a rebellion
or even to intimate that you are conscious of an existing rebellion being in progress with the avowed object of destroying that very union
at the same time your nominee for governor
in whose behalf you appeal
is known to you and to the world to declare against the use of an army to suppress the rebellion
your own attitude
encourages desertion
resistance to the draft
and the like
because it teaches those who incline to desert and to escape the draft to believe it is your purpose to protect them
and to hope that you will become strong enough to do so
after a short personal intercourse with you
gentlemen of the committee
i cannot say i think you desire this effect to follow your attitude but i assure your that both friends and enemies of the union look upon it in this light
it is a substantial hope
and by consequence a real strength to the enemy
if it is a false hope
and one which you would willingly dispel
i will make the way exceedingly easy
i send you duplicates of this letter in order that you
or a majority of you
if you choose
indorse your names upon one of them and return it thus indorsed to me with the understanding that those signing are thereby committed to the following propositions and to nothing else
that there is now a rebellion in the united states
the object and tendency of which is to destroy the national union and that
in your opinion
an army and navy are constitutional means for suppressing that rebellion 2
that no one of you will do anything which
in his own judgment
will tend to hinder the increase
or favor the decrease
or lessen the efficiency of the army or navy while engaged in the effort to suppress that rebellion and 3
that each of you will
in his sphere
do all he can to have the officers
and seamen of the army and navy
while engaged in the effort to suppress the rebellion
and otherwise well provided for and supported
and with the further understanding that upon receiving the letter and names thus indorsed
i will cause them to be published
which publication shall be
within itself
a revocation of the order in relation to mr
it will not escape observation that i consent to the release of mr
vallandigham upon terms not embracing any pledge from him or from others as to what he will or will not do
i do this because he is not present to speak for himself
or to authorize others to speak for him and because i should expect that on his returning he would not put himself practically in antagonism with the position of his friends
but i do it chiefly because i thereby prevail on other influential gentlemen of ohio to so define their position as to be of immense value to the army thus more than compensating for the consequences of any mistake in allowing mr
vallandigham to return so that
on the whole
the public safety will not have suffered by it
in regard to mr
vallandigham and all others
i must hereafter
as heretofore
do so much as the public safety may seem to require
i have the honor to be respectfully yours

stating that the main army is halted because it is believed the rebels are concentrating on the road towards hagerstown

these things appear to me to be connected with a purpose to cover baltimore and washington and to get the enemy across the river again without a further collision
and they do not appear connected with a purpose to prevent his crossing and to destroy him
i do fear the former purpose is acted upon and the latter rejected
if you are satisfied the latter purpose is entertained
and is judiciously pursued
i am content
if you are not so satisfied

response to a serenade
july 7
i am very glad indeed to see you to night
and yet i will not say i thank you for this call but i do most sincerely thank almighty god for the occasion on which you have called
how long ago is it eighty odd years since
on the fourth of july
for the first time in the history of the world
a nation
by its representatives
assembled and declared as a self evident truth that all men are created equal
that was the birthday of the united states of america
since then the fourth of july has had several very peculiar recognitions
the two men most distinguished in the framing and support of the declaration were thomas jefferson and john adams
the one having penned it
and the other sustained it the most forcibly in debate the only two of the fifty five who signed it and were elected presidents of the united states
precisely fifty years after they put their hands to the paper
it pleased almighty god to take both from this stage of action
this was indeed an extraordinary and remarkable event in our history
another president
five years after
was called from this stage of existence on the same day and month of the year and now on this last fourth of july just passed
when we have a gigantic rebellion
at the bottom of which is an effort to overthrow the principle that all men were created equal
we have the surrender of a most powerful position and army on that very day
and not only so
but in the succession of battles in pennsylvania
near to us
through three days
so rapidly fought that they might be called one great battle
on the first
and third of the month of july and on the fourth the cohorts of those who opposed the declaration that all men are created equal
turned tail and run
this is a glorious theme
and the occasion for a speech
but i am not prepared to make one worthy of the occasion
i would like to speak in terms of praise due to the many brave officers and soldiers who have fought in the cause of the union and liberties of their country from the beginning of the war
these are trying occasions
not only in success
but for the want of success
i dislike to mention the name of one single officer
lest i might do wrong to those i might forget
recent events bring up glorious names
and particularly prominent ones but these i will not mention
having said this much
i will now take the music

edward kidder
of wilmington
in which edward kidder says that he has had an interview with you in which you expressed an anxiety for any peace compatible with honor that you regard slavery as already dead
and the establishment of the confederacy as hopeless and that you should exert all your influence to bring about any reunion that would admit the south on terms of perfect equality with the north
on receipt of this letter i lost no time in laying it before the president of the united states
who expressed great gratification at hearing such sentiments from you
one of the most influential and honored of the southern governors
and he desires me to say that he fully shares your anxiety for the restoration of peace between the states and for a reunion of all the states on the basis of the abolition of slavery the bone we are fighting over and the full reinstatement of every confederate citizen in all the rights of citizenship in our common country
these points conceded
the president authorizes me to say that he will be glad to receive overtures from any man
or body of men
who have authority to control the armies of the confederacy and that he and the united states congress will be found very liberal on all collateral points that may come up in the settlement
his views on the collateral points that may naturally arise
the president desires me to say he will communicate to you through me if you should suggest the personal interview that mr
edward kidder recommends in his letter to his brother
in that case you will please forward to me
through mr
your official permit
as governor of north carolina

it has pleased almighty god to hearken to the supplications and prayers of an afflicted people
and to vouchsafe to the army and navy of the united states victories on land and on the sea so signal and so effective as to furnish reasonable grounds for augmented confidence that the union of these states will be maintained
their constitution preserved
and their peace and prosperity permanently restored
but these victories have been accorded not without sacrifices of life
and liberty
incurred by brave
and patriotic citizens
domestic affliction in every part of the country follows in the train of these fearful bereavements
it is meet and right to recognize and confess the presence of the almighty father
and the power of his hand equally in these triumphs and in these sorrows
be it known that i do set apart thursday
the 6th day of august next
to be observed as a day for national thanksgiving
and prayer
and i invite the people of the united states to assemble on that occasion in their customary places of worship
in the forms approved by their own consciences
render the homage due to the divine majesty for the wonderful things he has done in the nation's behalf
and invoke the influence of his holy spirit to subdue the anger which has produced and so long sustained a needless and cruel rebellion
to change the hearts of the insurgents
to guide the counsels of the government with wisdom adequate to so great a national emergency
and to visit with tender care and consolation throughout the length and breadth of our land all those who
through the vicissitudes of marches
and sieges have been
brought to suffer in mind
or estate
and finally to lead the whole nation through the paths of repentance and submission to the divine will back to the perfect enjoyment of union and fraternal peace

governor of new jersey
dear sir
yours of the 15th has been received
and considered by the secretary of war and myself
i was pained to be informed this morning by the provost marshal general that new jersey is now behind twelve thousand
irrespective of the draft
i did not have time to ascertain by what rules this was made out and i shall be very glad if it shall
by any means
prove to be incorrect
he also tells me that eight thousand will be about the quota of new jersey on the first draft and the secretary of war says the first draft in that state would not be made for some time in any event
as every man obtained otherwise lessens the draft so much
and this may supersede it altogether
i hope you will push forward your volunteer regiments as fast as possible
it is a very delicate matter to postpone the draft in one state
because of the argument it furnishes others to have postponement also
if we could have a reason in one case which would be good if presented in all cases
we could act upon it
i will thank you
to inform me
if you can
by what day
at the earliest
you can promise to have ready to be mustered into the united states service the eight thousand men
if you can make a reliable promise i mean one which you can rely on yourself of this sort

yesterday little indorsements of mine went to you in two cases of postmasterships sought for widows whose husbands have fallen in the battles of this war

as to what is fairly due from us herein the dispensing of patronage toward the men who

my conclusion is that
other claims and qualifications being equal
they have the better right and this is especially applicable to the disabled and the soldier

secretary of the navy
certain matters have come to my notice
and considered by me
which induce me to believe that it will conduce to the public interest for you to add to the general instructions given to our naval commanders in relation to contraband trade propositions substantially as follows
to wit
you will avoid the reality
and as far as possible the appearance
of using any neutral port to watch neutral vessels and then to dart out and seize them on their departure
complaint is made that this has been practiced at the port of st thomas
which practice
if it exists
is disapproved and must cease
you will not in any case detain the crew of a captured neutral vessel or any other subject of a neutral power on board such vessel
as prisoners of war or otherwise
except the small number necessary as witnesses in the prize court
the practice here forbidden is also charged to exist
if true
is disapproved and must cease
my dear sir
it is not intended to be insinuated that you have been remiss in the performance of the arduous and responsible duties of your department
i take pleasure in affirming
has in your hands been conducted with admirable success
while your subordinates are almost of necessity brought into angry collision with the subjects of foreign states
the representatives of those states and yourself do not come into immediate contact for the purpose of keeping the peace
in spite of such collisions
at that point there is an ultimate and heavy responsibility upon me
what i propose is in strict accordance with international law
and is therefore unobjectionable whilst
if it does no other good
it will contribute to sustain a considerable portion of the present british ministry in their places
if displaced
are sure to be replaced by others more unfavorable to us

july 25
his excellency governor joel parker
yours of the 21st is received
and i have taken time and considered and discussed the subject with the secretary of war and provost marshal general
in order
if possible
to make you a more favorable answer than i finally find myself able to do
it is a vital point with us to not have a special stipulation with the governor of any one state
because it would breed trouble in many
if not all
other states and my idea was when i wrote you
as it still is
to get a point of time to which we could wait
on the reason that we were not ready ourselves to proceed
and which might enable you to raise the quota of your state
in whole
or in large part
without the draft
the points of time you fix are much farther off than i had hoped
we might have got along in the way i have indicated for twenty
or possibly thirty
as it stands
the best i can say is that every volunteer you will present us within thirty days from this date
fit and ready to be mustered into the united states service
on the usual terms
shall be pro tanto an abatement of your quota of the draft
that quota i can now state at eight thousand seven hundred and eighty three 8783
no draft from new jersey
other than for the above quota
will be made before an additional draft
common to all the states
shall be required and i may add that if we get well through with this draft
i entertain a strong hope that any further one may never be needed
this expression of hope
must not be construed into a promise
as to conducting the draft by townships
i find it would require such a waste of labor already done
and such an additional amount of it
and such a loss of time
as to make it
i fear
your obedient servant
since writing the above
getting additional information
i am enabled to say that the draft may be made in subdistricts
as the enrolment has been made
or is in process of making
this will amount practically to drafting by townships
as the enrollment subdistricts are generally about the extent of townships

he said
among other things
he would send the ninth corps to you

1863 major general halleck
seeing general meade's despatch of yesterday to yourself causes me to fear that he supposes the government here is demanding of him to bring on a general engagement with lee as soon as possible
i am claiming no such thing of him
in fact
my judgment is against it which judgment
of course
i will yield if yours and his are the contrary
if he could not safely engage lee at williamsport
it seems absurd to suppose he can safely engage him now
when he has scarcely more than two thirds of the force he had at williamsport
while it must be that lee has been reinforced
i desired general meade to pursue lee across the potomac
as has proved true
that he would thereby clear the baltimore and ohio railroad
and get some advantages by harassing him on his retreat
these being past
i am unwilling he should now get into a general engagement on the impression that we here are pressing him
and i shall be glad for you to so inform him
unless your own judgment is against it

can we not renew the effort to organize a force to go to western texas
please consult with the general in chief on the subject

might not they be put into such an expedition
please think of it
i believe no local object is now more desirable

order of retaliation
executive mansion
july 30
it is the duty of every government to give protection to its citizens
of whatever class
or condition
and especially to those who are duly organized as soldiers in the public service
the law of nations and the usages and customs of war
as carried on by civilized powers
permit no distinction as to color in the treatment of prisoners of war as public enemies
to sell or enslave any captured person
on account of his color and for no offense against the laws of war
is a relapse into barbarism
and a crime against the civilization of the age
the government of the united states will give the same protection to all its soldiers and if the enemy shall sell or enslave any one because of his color
the offense shall be punished by retaliation upon the enemy's prisoners in our possession
it is therefore ordered that for every soldier of the united states killed in violation of the laws of war
a rebel soldier shall be executed and for every one enslaved by the enemy or sold into slavery
a rebel soldier shall be placed at hard labor on the public works
and continued at such labor until the other shall be released and receive the treatment due to a prisoner of war

my dear general hurlbut
your letter by mr
dana was duly received
i now learn that your resignation has reached the war department
i also learn that an active command has been assigned you by general grant
the secretary of war and general halleck are very partial to you
as you know i also am
we all wish you to reconsider the question of resigning not that we would wish to retain you greatly against your wish and interest
but that your decision may be at least a very well considered one
i understand that senator william k
sebastian
of arkansas
thinks of offering to resume his place in the senate
of course the senate
and not i
would decide whether to admit or reject him
still i should feel great interest in the question
it may be so presented as to be one of the very greatest national importance and it may be otherwise so presented as to be of no more than temporary personal consequence to him
the emancipation proclamation applies to arkansas
i think it is valid in law
and will be so held by the courts
i think i shall not retract or repudiate it
those who shall have tasted actual freedom i believe can never be slaves or quasi slaves again
for the rest
i believe some plan substantially being gradual emancipation would be better for both white and black
the missouri plan recently adopted
i do not object to on account of the time for ending the institution but i am sorry the beginning should have been postponed for seven years
leaving all that time to agitate for the repeal of the whole thing
it should begin at once
giving at least the new born a vested interest in freedom which could not be taken away
if senator sebastian could come with something of this sort from arkansas
at least
should take great interest in his case and i believe a single individual will have scarcely done the world so great a service
see him if you can
and read this to him but charge him not to make it public for the present
write me again
yours very truly

my dear general banks
while i very well know what i would be glad for louisiana to do
it is quite a different thing for me to assume direction of the matter
i would be glad for her to make a new constitution
recognizing the emancipation proclamation
and adopting emancipation in those parts of the state to which the proclamation does not apply
and while she is at it
i think it would not be objectionable for her to adopt some practical system by which the two races could gradually live themselves out of their old relation to each other
and both come out better prepared for the new
education for young blacks should be included in the plan
after all
the power or element of contract may be sufficient for this probationary period
and by its simplicity and flexibility may be the better
as an antislavery man
i have a motive to desire emancipation which proslavery men do not have but even they have strong enough reason to thus place themselves again under the shield of the union
and to thus perpetually hedge against the recurrence of the scenes through which we are now passing
governor shepley has informed me that mr
durant is now taking a registry
with a view to the election of a constitutional convention in louisiana
to me
appears proper
if such convention were to ask my views
i could present little else than what i now say to you
i think the thing should be pushed forward
so that
if possible
its mature work may reach here by the meeting of congress
for my own part
i think i shall not
in any event
retract the emancipation proclamation
as executive
ever return to slavery any person who is free by the terms of that proclamation
or by any of the acts of congress
if louisiana shall send members to congress
their admission to seats will depend
as you know
upon the respective houses
and not upon the president
yours very truly
to governor seymour
executive mansion
august 7
his excellency horatio seymour
governor of new york
your communication of the 3rd instant has been received and attentively considered
i cannot consent to suspend the draft in new york
as you request
among other reasons
time is too important
by the figures you send
which i presume are correct
the twelve districts represented fall into two classes of eight and four respectively
the disparity of the quotas for the draft in these two classes is certainly very striking
being the difference between an average of 2200 in one class and 4864 in the other
assuming that the districts are equal one to another in entire population
as required by the plan on which they were made
this disparity is such as to require attention
much of it
i suppose will be accounted for by the fact that so many more persons fit for soldiers are in the city than are in the country who have too recently arrived from other parts of the united states and from europe to be either included in the census of 1860
or to have voted in 1862
making due allowance for this
i am yet unwilling to stand upon it as an entirely sufficient explanation of the great disparity
i shall direct the draft to proceed in all the districts
at first from each of the four districts to wit
the second
and eighth only
2200 being the average quota of the other class
after this drawing
these four districts
and also the seventeenth and twenty ninth
shall be carefully re enrolled and
if you please
agents of yours may witness every step of the process
any deficiency which may appear by the new enrolment will be supplied by a special draft for that object
allowing due credit for volunteers who may be obtained from these districts respectively during the interval and at all points
so far as consistent with practical convenience
due credits shall be given for volunteers
and your excellency shall be notified of the time fixed for commencing the draft in each district
i do not object to abide a decision of the united states supreme court
or of the judges thereof
on the constitutionality of the draft law
in fact
i should be willing to facilitate the obtaining of it
but i cannot consent to lose the time while it is being obtained
we are contending with an enemy who
as i understand
drives every able bodied man he can reach into his ranks
very much as a butcher drives bullocks into the slaughter pen
no time is wasted
no argument is used
this produces an army which will soon turn upon our now victorious soldiers already in the field
if they shall not be sustained by recruits as they should be
it produces an army with a rapidity not to be matched on our side if we first waste time to re experiment with the volunteer system
already deemed by congress
and palpably
in fact
so far exhausted as to be inadequate and then more time to obtain a court decision as to whether a law is constitutional
which requires a part of those not now in the service to go to the aid of those who are already in it and still more time to determine with absolute certainty that we get those who are to go in the precisely legal proportion to those who are not to go
my purpose is to be in my action just and constitutional
and yet practical
in performing the important duty with which i am charged
of maintaining the unity and the free principles of our common country
your obedient servant

my dear general grant
i see by a despatch of yours that you incline quite strongly toward an expedition against mobile
this would appear tempting to me also
were it not that in view of recent events in mexico i am greatly impressed with the importance of re establishing the national authority in western texas as soon as possible
i am not making an order
however that i leave
for the present at least
to the general in chief
a word upon another subject
general thomas has gone again to the mississippi valley
with the view of raising colored troops
i have no reason to doubt that you are doing what you reasonably can upon the same subject
i believe it is a resource which if vigorously applied now will soon close the contest
it works doubly
weakening the enemy and strengthening us
we were not fully ripe for it until the river was opened
i think at least one hundred thousand can and ought to be rapidly organized along its shores
relieving all white troops to serve elsewhere
dana understands you as believing that the emancipation proclamation has helped some in your military operations
i am very glad if this is so
did you receive a short letter from me dated the 13th of july
yours very truly
to general w
executive mansion
august 10
my dear general rosecrans
yours of the 1st was received two days ago
i think you must have inferred more than general halleck has intended
as to any dissatisfaction of mine with you
i am sure you
as a reasonable man
would not have been wounded could you have heard all my words and seen all my thoughts in regard to you
i have not abated in my kind feeling for and confidence in you
i have seen most of your despatches to general halleck probably all of them
after grant invested vicksburg i was very anxious lest johnston should overwhelm him from the outside
and when it appeared certain that part of bragg's force had gone and was going to johnston
it did seem to me it was exactly the proper time for you to attack bragg with what force he had left
in all kindness let me say it so seems to me yet
finding from your despatches to general halleck that your judgment was different
and being very anxious for grant
on one occasion
told general halleck i thought he should direct you to decide at once to immediately attack bragg or to stand on the defensive and send part of your force to grant
he replied he had already so directed in substance
soon after
despatches from grant abated my anxiety for him
and in proportion abated my anxiety about any movement of yours
when afterward
i saw a despatch of yours arguing that the right time for you to attack bragg was not before
but would be after
the fall of vicksburg
it impressed me very strangely
and i think i so stated to the secretary of war and general halleck
it seemed no other than the proposition that you could better fight bragg when johnston should be at liberty to return and assist him than you could before he could so return to his assistance
since grant has been entirely relieved by the fall of vicksburg
by which johnston is also relieved
it has seemed to me that your chance for a stroke has been considerably diminished
and i have not been pressing you directly or indirectly
i am very anxious for east tennessee to be occupied by us but i see and appreciate the difficulties you mention
the question occurs
can the thing be done at all
does preparation advance at all
do you not consume supplies as fast as you get them forward
have you more animals to day than you had at the battle of stone's river
and yet have not more been furnished you since then than your entire present stock
i ask the same questions as to your mounted force
do not misunderstand
i am not casting blame upon you i rather think by great exertion you can get to east tennessee but a very important question is
can you stay there
i make no order in the case that i leave to general halleck and yourself
and now be assured once more that i think of you in all kindness and confidence
and that i am not watching you with an evil eye
yours very truly
to governor seymour
executive mansion washington

his excellency horatio seymour
governor of new york
yours of the 8th
with judge advocate general waterbury's report
was received to day
asking you to remember that i consider time as being very important
both to the general cause of the country and to the soldiers in the field
i beg to remind you that i waited
at your request
from the 1st until the 6th inst
to receive your communication dated the 3d
in view of its great length
and the known time and apparent care taken in its preparation
i did not doubt that it contained your full case as you desired to present it
it contained the figures for twelve districts
omitting the other nineteen
as i suppose
because you found nothing to complain of as to them
i answered accordingly
in doing so i laid down the principle to which i purpose adhering
which is to proceed with the draft
at the same time employing infallible means to avoid any great wrong
with the communication received to day you send figures for twenty eight districts
including the twelve sent before
and still omitting three
for which i suppose the enrolments are not yet received
in looking over the fuller list of twenty eight districts
i find that the quotas for sixteen of them are above 2000 and below 2700
of the rest
six are above 2700 and six are below 2000
applying the principle to these new facts
the fifth and seventh districts must be added to the four in which the quotas have already been reduced to 2200 for the first draft and with these four others just be added to those to be re enrolled
the correct case will then stand
the quotas of the second
and eighth districts fixed at 2200 for the first draft
the provost marshal general informs me that the drawing is already completed in the sixteenth
and thirtieth districts
in the others
except the three outstanding
the drawing will be made upon the quotas as now fixed
after the first draft
the second
and thirty first will be enrolled for the purpose and in the manner stated in my letter of the 7th inst
the same principle will be applied to the now outstanding districts when they shall come in
no part of my former letter is repudiated by reason of not being restated in this
or for any other cause
your obedient servant

my dear sir
our friend william g
greene has just presented a kind letter in regard to yourself
addressed to me by our other friends yates
and dubois
i doubt whether your present position is more painful to you than to myself
grateful for the patriotic stand so early taken by you in this life and death struggle of the nation
i have done whatever has appeared practicable to advance you and the public interest together
no charges
with a view to a trial
have been preferred against you by any one nor do i suppose any will be
all there is
so far as i have heard
is general grant's statement of his reasons for relieving you
and even this i have not seen or sought to see because it is a case
as appears to me
in which i could do nothing without doing harm
general grant and yourself have been conspicuous in our most important successes and for me to interfere and thus magnify a breach between you could not but be of evil effect
better leave it where the law of the case has placed it
for me to force you back upon general grant would be forcing him to resign
i cannot give you a new command
because we have no forces except such as already have commanders
i am constantly pressed by those who scold before they think
or without thinking at all
to give commands respectively to fremont
and perhaps others
all else out of the way
i have no commands to give them
this is now your case which
as i have said
pains me not less than it does you
my belief is that the permanent estimate of what a general does in the field is fixed by the cloud of witnesses who have been with him in the field
and that
relying on these
he who has the right needs not to fear
your friend as ever
telegram to governor seymour

your despatch of this morning is just received
and i fear i do not perfectly understand it
my view of the principle is that every soldier obtained voluntarily leaves one less to be obtained by draft
the only difficulty is in applying the principle properly
looking to time
as heretofore
i am unwilling to give up a drafted man now
even for the certainty
much less for the mere chance
of getting a volunteer hereafter
after the draft in any district
would it not make trouble to take any drafted man out and put a volunteer in for how shall it be determined which drafted man is to have the privilege of thus going out
to the exclusion of all the others
and even before the draft in any district the quota must be fixed and the draft must be postponed indefinitely if every time a volunteer is offered the officers must stop and reconstruct the quota
at least i fear there might be this difficulty but
at all events
let credits for volunteers be given up to the last moment which will not produce confusion or delay
that the principle of giving credits for volunteers shall be applied by districts seems fair and proper
though i do not know how far by present statistics it is practicable
when for any cause a fair credit is not given at one time
it should be given as soon thereafter as practicable
my purpose is to be just and fair
and yet to not lose time

months ago i should have acknowledged the receipt of your book and accompanying kind note and i now have to beg your pardon for not having done so
for one of my age i have seen very little of the drama
the first presentation of falstaff i ever saw was yours here
last winter or spring
perhaps the best compliment i can pay is to say

i think nothing equals macbeth
it is wonderful
unlike you gentlemen of the profession
i think the soliloquy in hamlet commencing oh

surpasses that commencing to be or not to be

there seems to be considerable misunderstanding about the recent movement to take possession of the new almaden mine
it has no reference to any other mine or mines
in regard to mines and miners generally
no change of policy by the government has been decided on
or even thought of
so far as i know
the new almaden mine was peculiar in this
that its occupants claimed to be the legal owners of it on a mexican grant
and went into court on that claim
the case found its way into the supreme court of the united states
and last term
in and by that court
the claim of the occupants was decided to be utterly fraudulent
thereupon it was considered the duty of the government by the secretary of the interior
the attorney general
and myself to take possession of the premises and the attorney general carefully made out the writ and i signed it
it was not obtained surreptitiously
although i suppose general halleck thought it had been
when he telegraphed
simply because he thought possession was about being taken by a military order
while he knew no such order had passed through his hands as general in chief
the writ was suspended
upon urgent representations from california
simply to keep the peace
it never had any direct or indirect reference to any mine
or person
except the new almaden mine and the persons connected with it

my dear sir
your letter inviting me to attend a mass meeting of unconditional union men
to be held at the capital of illinois
on the 3d day of september
has been received
it would be very agreeable for me thus to meet my old friends at my own home
but i cannot just now be absent from here so long as a visit there would require
the meeting is to be of all those who maintain unconditional devotion to the union
and i am sure that my old political friends will thank me for tendering
as i do
the nation's gratitude to those other noble men whom no partisan malice or partisan hope can make false to the nation's life
there are those who are dissatisfied with me
to such i would say
you desire peace
and you blame me that we do not have it
but how can we obtain it
there are but three conceivable ways
first to suppress the rebellion by force of arms
this i am trying to do
are you for it
if you are
so far we are agreed
if you are not for it
a second way is to give up the union
i am against this
are you for it
if you are you should say so plainly
if you are not for force nor yet for dissolution
there only remains some imaginable compromise
i do not believe that any compromise embracing the maintenance of the union is now possible
all that i learn leads to a directly opposite belief
the strength of the rebellion is its military
its army
that army dominates all the country and all the people within its range
any offer of terms made by any man or men within that range
in opposition to that army
is simply nothing for the present because such man or men have no power whatever to enforce their side of a compromise
if one were made with them
to illustrate
suppose refugees from the south and peace men of the north get together in convention
and frame and proclaim a compromise embracing a restoration of the union
in what way can that compromise be used to keep lee's army out of pennsylvania
meade's army can keep lee's army out of pennsylvania
i think
can ultimately drive it out of existence
but no paper compromise to which the controllers of lee's army are not agreed can at all affect that army
in an effort at such compromise we would waste time
which the enemy would improve to our disadvantage and that would be all
a compromise
to be effective
must be made either with those who control the rebel army
or with the people
first liberated from the domination of that army by the success of our own army
now allow me to assure you that no word or intimation from that rebel army
or from any of the men controlling it
in relation to any peace compromise
has ever come to my knowledge or belief
all charges and insinuations to the contrary are deceptive and groundless
and i promise you that if any such proposition shall hereafter come
it shall not be rejected and kept a secret from you
i freely acknowledge myself to be the servant of the people
according to the bond of service
the united states constitution
and that
as such
i am responsible to them
to be plain
you are dissatisfied with me about the negro
quite likely there is a difference of opinion between you and myself upon that subject
i certainly wish that all men could be free
while you
i suppose
do not
i have neither adopted nor proposed any measure which is not consistent with even your view
provided you are for the union
i suggested compensated emancipation to which you replied you wished not to be taxed to buy negroes
but i had not asked you to be taxed to buy negroes
except in such way as to save you from greater taxation to save the union exclusively by other means
you dislike the emancipation proclamation
and perhaps would have it retracted
you say it is unconstitutional
i think differently
i think the constitution invests its commander in chief with the law of war in time of war
the most that can be said
if so much
that slaves are property
is there
has there ever been
any question that by the law of war
both of enemies and friends
may be taken when needed
and is it not needed whenever it helps us and hurts the enemy
the world over
destroy enemies' property when they cannot use it
and even destroy their own to keep it from the enemy
civilized belligerents do all in their power to help themselves or hurt the enemy
except a few things regarded as barbarous or cruel
among the exceptions are the massacre of vanquished foes and non combatants
male and female
but the proclamation
as law
either is valid or is not valid
if it is not valid it needs no retraction
if it is valid it cannot be retracted
any more than the dead can be brought to life
some of you profess to think its retraction would operate favorably for the union
why better after the retraction than before the issue
there was more than a year and a half of trial to suppress the rebellion before the proclamation was issued
the last one hundred days of which passed under an explicit notice that it was coming
unless averted by those in revolt returning to their allegiance
the war has certainly progressed as favorably for us since the issue of the proclamation as before
i know
as fully as one can know the opinions of others
that some of the commanders of our armies in the field
who have given us our most important victories
believe the emancipation policy and the use of colored troops constitute the heaviest blows yet dealt to the rebellion
and that at least one of those important successes could not have been achieved when it was but for the aid of black soldiers
among the commanders who hold these views are some who have never had any affinity with what is called abolitionism
or with republican party politics
but who hold them purely as military opinions
i submit their opinions are entitled to some weight against the objections often urged that emancipation and arming the blacks are unwise as military measures
and were not adopted as such in good faith
you say that you will not fight to free negroes
some of them seem willing to fight for you but no matter
fight you
to save the union
i issued the proclamation on purpose to aid you in saving the union
whenever you shall have conquered all resistance to the union
if i shall urge you to continue fighting
it will be an apt time then for you to declare you will not fight to free negroes
i thought that in your struggle for the union
to whatever extent the negroes should cease helping the enemy
to that extent it weakened the enemy in his resistance to you
do you think differently
i thought that whatever negroes can be got to do as soldiers
leaves just so much less for white soldiers to do in saving the union
does it appear otherwise to you
but negroes
like other people
act upon motives
why should they do anything for us if we will do nothing for them
if they stake their lives for us they must be prompted by the strongest motive
even the promise of freedom
and the promise
being made
must be kept
the signs look better
the father of waters again goes unvexed to the sea
thanks to the great northwest for it nor yet wholly to them
three hundred miles up they met new england
and jersey
hewing their way right and left
the sunny south
in more colors than one
also lent a helping hand
on the spot
their part of the history was jotted down in black and white
the job was a great national one
and let none be slighted who bore an honorable part in it and while those who have cleared the great river may well be proud
even that is not all
it is hard to say that anything has been more bravely and well done than at antietam
and on many fields of less note
nor must uncle sam's web feet be forgotten
at all the watery margins they have been present not only on the deep sea
the broad bay
and the rapid river
but also up the narrow
muddy bayou
and wherever the ground was a little damp
they have been and made their tracks
thanks to all
for the great republic for the principle it lives by and keeps alive for man's vast future thanks to all
peace does not appear so distant as it did
i hope it will come soon
and come to stay
and so come as to be worth the keeping in all future time
it will then have been proved that among freemen there can be no successful appeal from the ballot to the bullet
and that they who take such appeal are sure to lose their case and pay the cost
and there will be some black men who can remember that with silent tongue
and clinched teeth
and steady eye
and well poised bayonet
they have helped mankind on to this great consummation while i fear there will be some white ones unable to forget that with malignant heart and deceitful speech they have striven to hinder it
let us not be over sanguine of a speedy
final triumph
let us be quite sober
let us diligently apply the means
never doubting that a just god
in his own good time
will give us the rightful result

secretary of war sir
in my correspondence with governor seymour in relation to the draft
i have said to him
that credits shall be given for volunteers up to the latest moment
before drawing in any district
that can be done without producing confusion or delay
in order to do this
let our mustering officers in new york and elsewhere be at
once instructed that whenever they muster into our service any number of volunteers
to at once make return to the war department
both by telegraph and mail
the date of the muster
the number mustered
and the congressional or enrolment district or districts
of their residences
giving the numbers separately for each district
keep these returns diligently posted
and by them give full credit on the quotas
if possible
on the last day before the draft begins in any district
i have informed governor seymour that he shall be notified of the time when the draft is to commence in each district in his state
this is equally proper for all the states
in order to carry it out
i propose that so soon as the day for commencing the draft in any district is definitely determined
the governor of the state
including the district
be notified thereof
both by telegraph and mail
in form about as follows
1863
governor of you are notified that the draft will commence in the district
at on the day 1863
at a
of said day
please acknowledge receipt of this by telegraph and mail
this notice may be given by the provost marshal general here
the sub provost marshal generals in the states
or perhaps by the district provost marshals
whenever we shall have so far proceeded in new york as to make the re enrolment specially promised there practicable
i wish that also to go forward
and i wish governor seymour notified of it so that if he choose
he can place agents of his with ours to see the work fairly done

in my letter of the 26th insert between the sentence ending since the issue of the emancipation proclamation as before and the next
commencing you say you will not fight
what follows below my signature hereto
i know as fully as one can know the opinions of others that some of the commanders of our armies in the field
who have given us our most important successes
believe the emancipation policy and the use of colored troops constitute the heaviest blow yet dealt to the rebellion
and that at least one of those important successes could not have been achieved when it was
but for the aid of black soldiers
among the commanders holding these views are some who have never had any affinity with what is called abolitionism
or with republican party politics
but who hold them purely as military opinions
i submit these opinions as being entitled to some weight against the objections
often urged
that emancipation and arming the blacks are unwise as military measures and were not adopted as such in good faith

yours of the 22d was received yesterday

i did not intend

you had informed me you were impressed through general halleck that i was dissatisfied with you
and i could not bluntly deny that i was without unjustly implicating him
i therefore concluded to tell you the plain truth
being satisfied the matter would thus appear much smaller than it would if seen by mere glimpses
i repeat that my appreciation of you has not abated
i can never forget whilst i remember anything
that about the end of last year and the beginning of this
you gave us a hard earned victory
had there been a defeat instead
the nation could hardly have lived over
neither can i forget the check you so opportunely gave to a dangerous sentiment which was spreading in the north

my dear sir
all tennessee is now clear of armed insurrectionists
you need not to be reminded that it is the nick of time for reinaugurating a loyal state government
not a moment should be lost
you and the co operating friends there can better judge of the ways and means than can be judged by any here
i only offer a few suggestions
the reinauguration must not be such as to give control of the state and its representation in congress to the enemies of the union
driving its friends there into political exile
the whole struggle for tennessee will have been profitless to both state and nation if it so ends that governor johnson is put down and governor harris put up
it must not be so
you must have it otherwise
let the reconstruction be the work of such men only as can be trusted for the union
exclude all others
and trust that your government so organized will be recognized here as being the one of republican form to be guaranteed to the state
and to be protected against invasion and domestic violence
it is something on the question of time to remember that it cannot be known who is next to occupy the position i now hold
nor what he will do
i see that you have declared in favor of emancipation in tennessee
for which may god bless you
get emancipation into your new state government constitution and there will be no such word as fail for your cause

proclamation suspending writ of habeas corpus
september 15
by the president of the united states of america
a proclamation
whereas the constitution of the united states has ordained that the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended unless when
in cases of rebellion or invasion
the public safety may require it and
whereas a rebellion was existing on the third day of march
which rebellion is still existing and
whereas by a statute which was approved on that day it was enacted by the senate and house of representatives of the united states in congress assembled that during the present insurrection the president of the united states
whenever in his judgment the public safety may require
is authorized to suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus in any case throughout the united states or any part thereof and
in the judgment of the president
the public safety does require that the privilege of the said writ shall new be suspended throughout the united states in the cases where
by the authority of the president of the united states
and civil officers of the united states
or any of them
hold persons under their command or in their custody
either as prisoners of war
or aiders or abettors of the enemy
or officers
or seamen enrolled or drafted or mustered or enlisted in or belonging to the land or naval forces of the united states
or as deserters therefrom
or otherwise amenable to military law or the rules and articles of war or the rules or regulations prescribed for the military or naval services by authority of the president of the united states
or for resisting a draft
or for any other offense against the military or naval service
abraham lincoln
president of the united states
do hereby proclaim and make known to all whom it may concern that the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus is suspended throughout the united states in the several cases before mentioned
and that this suspension will continue throughout the duration of the said rebellion or until this proclamation shall
by a subsequent one to be issued by the president of the united states
be modified or revoked
and i do hereby require all magistrates
and other civil officers within the united states and all officers and others in the military and naval services of the united states to take distinct notice of this suspension and to give it full effect
and all citizens of the united states to conduct and govern themselves accordingly and in conformity with the constitution of the united states and the laws of congress in such case made and provided

september 19
major general halleck
by general meade's despatch to you of yesterday it appears that he desires your views and those of the government as to whether he shall advance upon the enemy
i am not prepared to order
or even advise
an advance in this case
wherein i know so little of particulars
and wherein he
in the field
thinks the risk is so great and the promise of advantage so small
and yet the case presents matter for very serious consideration in another aspect
these two armies confront each other across a small river
substantially midway between the two capitals
each defending its own capital
and menacing the other
general meade estimates the enemy's infantry in front of him at not less than 40
suppose we add fifty per cent
to this for cavalry
and extra duty men stretching as far as richmond
making the whole force of the enemy 60
general meade
as shown by the returns
has with him
and between him and washington
of the same classes
of well men
over 90
neither can bring the whole of his men into a battle but each can bring as large a percentage in as the other
for a battle
general meade has three men to general lee's two
it having been determined that choosing ground and standing on the defensive gives so great advantage that the three cannot safely attack the two
the three are left simply standing on the defensive also
if the enemy's 60
000 are sufficient to keep our 90
000 away from richmond
by the same rule
may not 40
000 of ours keep their 60
000 away from washington
leaving us 50
000 to put to some other use
having practically come to the mere defensive
it seems to be no economy at all to employ twice as many men for that object as are needed
with no object
to mislead myself
i can perceive no fault in this statement
unless we admit we are not the equal of the enemy
man for man
i hope you will consider it
to avoid misunderstanding
let me say that to attempt to fight the enemy slowly back into his entrenchments at richmond
and then to capture him
is an idea i have been trying to repudiate for quite a year
my judgment is so clear against it that i would scarcely allow the attempt to be made if the general in command should desire to make it
my last attempt upon richmond was to get mcclellan
when he was nearer there than the enemy was
to run in ahead of him
since then i have constantly desired the army of the potomac to make lee's army
and not richmond
its objective point
if our army cannot fall upon the enemy and hurt him where he is
it is plain to me it can gain nothing by attempting to follow him over a succession of intrenched lines into a fortified city

major general halleck
i think it very important for general rosecrans to hold his position at or about chattanooga
because if held from that place to cleveland
both inclusive
it keeps all tennessee clear of the enemy
and also breaks one of his most important railroad lines
to prevent these consequences is so vital to his cause that he cannot give up the effort to dislodge us from the position
thus bringing him to us and saving us the labor
and hazard of going farther to find him
and also giving us the advantage of choosing our own ground and preparing it to fight him upon
the details must
of course
be left to general rosecrans
while we must furnish him the means to the utmost of our ability
if you concur
i think he would better be informed that we are not pushing him beyond this position and that
in fact
our judgment is rather against his going beyond it
if he can only maintain this position
without more
this rebellion can only eke out a short and feeble existence

the result is that we are worsted
if at all
only in the fact that we
after the main fighting was over
yielded the ground
thus leaving considerable of our artillery and wounded to fall into the enemy's hands
for which we got nothing in turn
we lost in general officers one killed and three or four wounded

according to the rebel accounts which we have
they lost six killed and eight wounded

there is no organized military force in avowed opposition to the general government now in missouri
and if any shall reappear
your duty in regard to it will be too plain to require any special instruction
the condition of things
both there and elsewhere
is such as to render it indispensable to maintain
for a time
the united states military establishment in that state
as well as to rely upon it for a fair contribution of support to that establishment generally
your immediate duty in regard to missouri now is to advance the efficiency of that establishment
and to so use it
as far as practicable
to compel the excited people there to let one another alone
under your recent order
which i have approved
you will only arrest individuals
and suppress assemblies or newspapers
when they may be working palpable injury to the military in your charge and in no other case will you interfere with the expression of opinion in any form
or allow it to be interfered with violently by others
in this you have a discretion to exercise with great caution
and forbearance
with the matter of removing the inhabitants of certain counties en masse
and of removing certain individuals from time to time
who are supposed to be mischievous
i am not now interfering
but am leaving to your own discretion
nor am i interfering with what may still seem to you to be necessary restrictions upon trade and intercourse
i think proper
to enjoin upon you the following
allow no part of the military under your command to be engaged in either returning fugitive slaves or in forcing or enticing slaves from their homes and
so far as practicable
enforce the same forbearance upon the people
report to me your opinion upon the availability for good of the enrolled militia of the state
allow no one to enlist colored troops
except upon orders from you
or from here through you
allow no one to assume the functions of confiscating property
under the law of congress
or otherwise
except upon orders from here

and only those
are allowed to vote who are entitled to do so by the laws of missouri
including as of those laws the restrictions laid by the missouri convention upon those who may have participated in the rebellion
so far as practicable
you will
by means of your military force
expel guerrillas
and murderers
and all who are known to harbor
or abet them
but in like manner you will repress assumptions of unauthorized individuals to perform the same service
because under pretense of doing this they become marauders and murderers themselves

let the military obey orders
and those not of the military leave each other alone
thus not breaking the peace themselves

proclamation for thanksgiving
october 3
by the president of the united states america
a proclamation
the year that is drawing towards its close has been filled with the blessings of fruitful fields and healthful skies
to these bounties
which are so constantly enjoyed that we are prone to forget the source from which they come
others have been added which are of so extraordinary a nature that they cannot fail to penetrate and soften even the heart which is habitually insensible to the ever watchful providence of almighty god
in the midst of a civil war of unequalled magnitude and severity which has sometimes seemed to invite and provoke the aggressions of foreign states peace has been preserved with all nations
order has been maintained
the laws have been respected and obeyed
and harmony has prevailed everywhere except in the theatre of military conflict while that theatre has been greatly contracted by the advancing armies and navies of the union
the needful diversion of wealth and strength from the fields of peaceful industry
to the national defense has not arrested the plough
the shuttle
or the ship
the axe has enlarged the borders of our settlements
and the mines
as well of
iron and coal as of the precious metals
have yielded even more abundantly than heretofore
population has steadily increased
notwithstanding the waste that has been made in the camp
the siege
and the battle field and the country
rejoicing in the consciousness of augmented strength and vigor
is permitted to expect a continuance of years
with large increase of freedom
no human counsel hath devised
nor hath any mortal hand worked out these great things
they are the gracious gifts of the most high god
while dealing with us in anger for our sins
hath nevertheless remembered mercy
it has seemed to me fit and proper that they should be reverently
and gratefully acknowledged
as with one heart and voice
by the whole american people
i do
invite my fellow citizens in every part of the united states
and also those who are at sea
and those who are sojourning in foreign lands
to set apart and observe the last thursday of november next as a day of thanksgiving and prayer to our beneficent father who dwelleth in the heavens
and i recommend to them that
while offering up the ascriptions justly due to him for such singular deliverances and blessings
they do also
with humble penitence for our national perverseness and disobedience
commend to his tender care all those who have become widows
or sufferers in the lamentable civil strife in which we are unavoidably engaged
and fervently implore the interposition of the almighty hand to heal the wounds of the nation
and to restore it
as soon as may be consistent with divine purposes
to the full enjoyment of peace
and union
in testimony whereof
i have hereunto set my hand

major general rosecrans
yours of yesterday received
if we can hold chattanooga and east tennessee
i think the rebellion must dwindle and die
i think you and burnside can do this
and hence doing so is your main object
of course to greatly damage or destroy the enemy in your front would be a greater object
because it would include the former and more
but it is not so certainly within your power
i understand the main body of the enemy is very near you
so near that you could board at home
so to speak
and menace or attack him any day
would not the doing of this be your best mode of counteracting his raid on your communications
but this is not an order
i intend doing something like what you suggest whenever the case shall appear ripe enough to have it accepted in the true understanding rather than as a confession of weakness and fear
to c
drake and others
executive mansion
october 5
charles d
drake and others
your original address
presented on the 30th ult
and the four supplementary ones presented on the 3d inst
have been carefully considered
i hope you will regard the other duties claiming my attention
together with the great length and importance of these documents
as constituting a sufficient apology for not having responded sooner
these papers
framed for a common object
consist of the things demanded and the reasons for demanding them
the things demanded are first
that general schofield shall be relieved
and general butler be appointed as commander of the military department of missouri
that the system of enrolled militia in missouri may be broken up
and national forces he substituted for it and third
that at elections persons may not be allowed to vote who are not entitled by law to do so
among the reasons given
enough of suffering and wrong to union men is certainly
and i suppose truly
yet the whole case
as presented
fails to convince me that general schofield
or the enrolled militia
is responsible for that suffering and wrong
the whole can be explained on a more charitable
as i think
a more rational hypothesis
we are in a civil war
in such cases there always is a main question
but in this case that question is a perplexing compound union and slavery
it thus becomes a question not of two sides merely
but of at least four sides
even among those who are for the union
saying nothing of those who are against it
those who are for the union with
but not without slavery those for it without
but not with those for it with or without
but prefer it with and those for it with or without
but prefer it without
among these
is a subdivision of those who are for gradual
but not for immediate
and those who are for immediate
but not for gradual extinction of slavery
it is easy to conceive that all these shades of opinion
and even more
may be sincerely entertained by honest and truthful men
all being for the union
by reason of these differences each will prefer a different way of sustaining the union
at once
sincerity is questioned
and motives are assailed
actual war comming
blood grows hot and blood is spilled
thought is forced from old channels into confusion
deception breeds and thrives
confidence dies
and universal suspicion reigns
each man feels an impulse to kill his neighbor
lest he be killed by him
revenge and retaliation follow
and all this
as before said
may be among honest men only
but this is not all
every foul bird comes abroad
and every dirty reptile rises up
these add crime to confusion
strong measures deemed indispensable
but harsh at best
such men make worse by maladministration
murders for old grudges
and murders for self
proceed under any cloak that will best serve for the occasion
these causes amply account for what has occurred in missouri
without ascribing it to the weakness or wickedness of any general
the newspaper files
those chroniclers of current events
will show that the evils now complained of were quite as prevalent under fremont
and curtis
as under schofield
if the former had greater force opposed to them
they also had greater force with which to meet it
when the organized rebel army left the state
the main federal force had to go also
leaving the department commander at home relatively no stronger than before
without disparaging any
i affirm with confidence that no commander of that department has
in proportion to his means
done better than general schofield
the first specific charge against general schofield is
that the enrolled militia was placed under his command
whereas it had not been placed under the command of general curtis
the fact is
i believe
true but you do not point out
nor can i conceive
how that did
or could
injure loyal men or the union cause
you charge that
general curtis being superseded by general schofield
franklin a
dick was superseded by james o
broadhead as provost marshal general
no very specific showing is made as to how this did or could injure the union cause
it recalls
the condition of things
as presented to me
which led to a change of commander of that department
to restrain contraband intelligence and trade
a system of searches
and passes
had been introduced
i think
by general fremont
when general halleck came
he found and continued the system
and added an order
applicable to some parts of the state
to levy and collect contributions from noted rebels
to compensate losses and relieve destitution caused by the rebellion
the action of general fremont and general halleck
as stated
constituted a sort of system which general curtis found in full operation when he took command of the department
that there was a necessity for something of the sort was clear but that it could only be justified by stern necessity
and that it was liable to great abuse in administration
was equally clear
agents to execute it
contrary to the great prayer
were led into temptation
some might
while others would not
resist that temptation
it was not possible to hold any to a very strict accountability and those yielding to the temptation would sell permits and passes to those who would pay most and most readily for them
and would seize property and collect levies in the aptest way to fill their own pockets
money being the object
the man having money
whether loyal or disloyal
would be a victim
this practice doubtless existed to some extent
and it was
a real additional evil that it could be
and was
plausibly charged to exist in greater extent than it did
when general curtis took command of the department
against whom i never knew anything to allege
had general charge of this system
a controversy in regard to it rapidly grew into almost unmanageable proportions
one side ignored the necessity and magnified the evils of the system
while the other ignored the evils and magnified the necessity and each bitterly assailed the other
i could not fail to see that the controversy enlarged in the same proportion as the professed union men there distinctly took sides in two opposing political parties
i exhausted my wits
and very nearly my patience also
in efforts to convince both that the evils they charged on each other were inherent in the case
and could not be cured by giving either party a victory over the other
the irritating system was not to be perpetual and it was plausibly urged that it could be modified at once with advantage
the case could scarcely be worse
and whether it could be made better could only be determined by a trial
in this view
and not to ban or brand general curtis
or to give a victory to any party
i made the change of commander for the department
i now learn that soon after this change mr
dick was removed
and that mr
a gentleman of no less good character
was put in the place
the mere fact of this change is more distinctly complained of than is any conduct of the new officer
or other consequence of the change
i gave the new commander no instructions as to the administration of the system mentioned
beyond what is contained in the private letter afterwards surreptitiously published
in which i directed him to act solely for the public good
and independently of both parties
neither any thing you have presented me
nor anything i have otherwise learned
has convinced me that he has been unfaithful to this charge
imbecility is urged as one cause for removing general schofield and the late massacre at lawrence
is pressed as evidence of that imbecility
to my mind that fact scarcely tends to prove the proposition
that massacre is only an example of what grierson
john morgan
and many others might have repeatedly done on their respective raids
had they chosen to incur the personal hazard
and possessed the fiendish hearts to do it
the charge is made that general schofield
on purpose to protect the lawrence murderers
would not allow them to be pursued into missouri
while no punishment could be too sudden or too severe for those murderers
i am well satisfied that the preventing of the threatened remedial raid into missouri was the only way to avoid an indiscriminate massacre there
including probably more innocent than guilty
instead of condemning
i therefore approve what i understand general schofield did in that respect
the charges that general schofield has purposely withheld protection from loyal people and purposely facilitated the objects of the disloyal are altogether beyond my power of belief
i do not arraign the veracity of gentlemen as to the facts complained of
but i do more than question the judgment which would infer that those facts occurred in accordance with the purposes of general schofield
with my present views
i must decline to remove general schofield
in this i decide nothing against general butler
i sincerely wish it were convenient to assign him a suitable command
in order to meet some existing evils i have addressed a letter of instructions to general schofield
a copy of which i enclose to you
as to the enrolled militia
i shall endeavor to ascertain better than i now know what is its exact value
let me say now
that your proposal to substitute national forces for the enrolled militia implies that in your judgment the latter is doing something which needs to be done and if so
the proposition to throw that force away and to supply its place by bringing other forces from the field where they are urgently needed seems to me very extraordinary
whence shall they come
shall they be withdrawn from banks
or grant
or steele
or rosecrans
few things have been so grateful to my anxious feelings as when
in june last
the local force in missouri aided general schofield to so promptly send a large general force to the relief of general grant
then investing vicksburg and menaced from without by general johnston
was this all wrong
should the enrolled militia then have been broken up and general herron kept from grant to police missouri
so far from finding cause to object
i confess to a sympathy for whatever relieves our general force in missouri and allows it to serve elsewhere
i therefore
as at present advised
cannot attempt the destruction of the enrolled militia of missouri
i may add that
the force being under the national military control
it is also within the proclamation in regard to the habeas corpus
i concur in the propriety of your request in regard to elections
and have
as you see
directed general schofield accordingly
i do not feel justified to enter upon the broad field you present in regard to the political differences between radicals and conservatives
from time to time i have done and said what appeared to me proper to do and say
the public knows it all
it obliges nobody to follow me
and i trust it obliges me to follow nobody
the radicals and conservatives each agree with me in some things and disagree in others
i could wish both to agree with me in all things
for then they would agree with each other
and would be too strong for any foe from any quarter
choose to do otherwise and i do not question their right
i too shall do what seems to be my duty
i hold whoever commands in missouri or elsewhere responsible to me and not to either radicals or conservatives
it is my duty to hear all
but at last i must
within my sphere
judge what to do and what to forbear

in making the present movement
lee gathered in all available scraps
and added them to hill's and ewell's corps but that is all
and he made the movement in the belief that four corps had left general meade and general meade's apparently avoiding a collision with him has confirmed him in that belief
if general meade can now attack him on a field no worse than equal for us
and will do so now with all the skill and courage which he

the quotas of three hundred thousand men
i further proclaim that all the volunteers thus called out and duly enlisted shall receive advance pay
and bounty
as heretofore communicated to the governors of states by the war department through the provost marshal general's office
by special letters
i further proclaim that all volunteers received under this call
as well as all others not heretofore credited
shall be duly credited and deducted from the quotas established for the next draft
i further proclaim that if any state shall fail to raise the quota assigned to it by the war department under this call
then a draft for the deficiency in said quota shall be made in said state
or in the districts of said state
for their due proportion of said quota
and the said draft shall commence on the 5th day of january
and i further proclaim that nothing in this proclamation shall interfere with existing orders
or with those which may be issued for the present draft in the states where it is now in progress
or where it has not yet been commenced
the quotas of the states and districts will be assigned by the war department through the provost marshal general's office
due regard being had for the men heretofore furnished
whether by volunteering or drafting and the recruiting will be conducted in accordance with such instructions as have been or may be issued by that department
in issuing this proclamation
i address myself not only to the governors of the several states
but also to the good and loyal people thereof
invoking them to lend their cheerful
and effective aid to the measures thus adopted
with a view to reinforce our victorious army now in the field

taking all our information together
i think it probable that ewell's corps has started for east tennessee by way of abingdon
marching last monday
say from meade's front directly to the railroad at charlottesville
the object of lee's recent movement against meade his destruction of the alexandria and orange railroad
and subsequent withdrawal without more motive
not otherwise apparent
would be explained by this hypothesis
the direct statement of sharpe's men that ewell has gone to tennessee
the irishman's northern spy in richmond statement that he has not gone through richmond
and his further statement of an appeal made to the people at richmond to go and protect their salt
which could only refer to the works near abingdon
graham's statement from martinsburg that imboden is in retreat for harrisonburg
this last matches with the idea that lee has retained his cavalry
sending imboden and perhaps other scraps to join ewell
upon this probability what is to be done
if you have a plan matured
i have nothing to say
if you have not
then i suggest that
with all possible expedition
the army of the potomac get ready to attack lee
and that in the meantime a raid shall
at all hazards
break the railroad at or near lynchburg

when he sent his great voice forth out of his breast
his words fell like the winter snows
nor then would any mortal contend with ulysses homer
introduction no man since washington has become to americans so familiar or so beloved a figure as abraham lincoln
he is to them the representative and typical american
the man who best embodies the political ideals of the nation
he is typical in the fact that he sprang from the masses of the people
that he remained through his whole career a man of the people
that his chief desire was to be in accord with the beliefs and wishes of the people
that he never failed to trust in the people and to rely on their support
every native american knows his life and his speeches
his anecdotes and witticisms have passed into the thought and the conversation of the whole nation as those of no other statesman have done
he belongs
not only to the united states
but to the whole of civilized mankind
it is no exaggeration to say that he has
within the last thirty years
grown to be a conspicuous figure in the history of the modern world
without him
the course of events not only in the western hemisphere but in europe also would have been different
for he was called to guide at the greatest crisis of its fate a state already mighty
and now far more mighty than in his days
and the guidance he gave has affected the march of events ever since
a life and a character such as his ought to be known to and comprehended by europeans as well as by americans
among europeans
it is especially englishmen who ought to appreciate him and understand the significance of his life
for he came of an english stock
he spoke the english tongue
his action told upon the progress of events and the shaping of opinion in all british communities everywhere more than it has done upon any other nation outside america itself
this collection of lincoln's speeches seeks to make him known by his words as readers of history know him by his deeds
in popularly governed countries the great statesman is almost of necessity an orator
though his eminence as a speaker may be no true measure either of his momentary power or of his permanent fame
for wisdom
courage and tact bear little direct relation to the gift for speech
but whether that gift be present in greater or in lesser degree
the character and ideas of a statesman are best studied through his own words
this is particularly true of lincoln
because he was not what may be called a professional orator
there have been famous orators whose speeches we may read for the beauty of their language or for the wealth of ideas they contain
with comparatively little regard to the circumstances of time and place that led to their being delivered
lincoln is not one of these
his speeches need to be studied in close relation to the occasions which called them forth
they are not philosophical lucubrations or brilliant displays of rhetoric
they are a part of his life
they are the expression of his convictions
and derive no small part of their weight and dignity from the fact that they deal with grave and urgent questions
and express the spirit in which he approached those questions
few great characters stand out so clearly revealed by their words
whether spoken or written
as he does
accordingly lincoln's discourses are not like those of nearly all the men whose eloquence has won them fame
when we think of such men as pericles
we think of exuberance of ideas or of phrases
of a command of appropriate similes or metaphors
of the gifts of invention and of exposition
of imaginative flights
or outbursts of passion fit to stir and rouse an audience to like passion
we think of the orator as gifted with a powerful or finely modulated voice
an imposing presence
a graceful delivery
or if remembering that lincoln was by profession a lawyer and practised until he became president of the united states we think of the special gifts which mark the forensic orator
we should expect to find a man full of ingenuity and subtlety
one dexterous in handling his case in such wise as to please and capture the judge or the jury whom he addresses
one skilled in those rhetorical devices and strokes of art which can be used
when need be
to engage the listener's feelings and distract his mind from the real merits of the issue
of all this kind of talent there was in lincoln but little
he was not an artful pleader indeed
it was said of him that he could argue well only those cases in the justice of which he personally believed
and was unable to make the worse appear the better reason
for most of the qualities which the world admires in cicero or in burke we should look in vain in lincoln's speeches
they are not fine pieces of exquisite diction
fit to be declaimed as school exercises or set before students as models of composition
are their merits
and why do they deserve to be valued and remembered
how comes it that a man of first rate powers was deficient in qualities appertaining to his own profession which men less remarkable have possessed
to answer this question
let us first ask what were the preparation and training abraham lincoln had for oratory
whether political or forensic
born in rude and abject poverty
he had never any education
except what he gave himself
till he was approaching manhood
not even books wherewith to inform and train his mind were within his reach
no school
no university
no legal faculty had any part in training his powers
when he became a lawyer and a politician
the years most favourable to continuous study had already passed
and the opportunities he found for reading were very scanty
he knew but few authors in general literature
though he knew those few thoroughly
he taught himself a little mathematics
but he could read no language save his own
and can have had only the faintest acquaintance with european history or with any branch of philosophy
the want of regular education was not made up for by the persons among whom his lot was cast
till he was a grown man
he never moved in any society from which he could learn those things with which the mind of an orator or a statesman ought to be stored
even after he had gained some legal practice
there was for many years no one for him to mix with except the petty practitioners of a petty town
men nearly all of whom knew little more than he did himself
schools gave him nothing
and society gave him nothing
but he had a powerful intellect and a resolute will
isolation fostered not only self reliance but the habit of reflection
of prolonged and intense reflection
he made all that he knew a part of himself
he thought everything out for himself
his convictions were his own clear and coherent
he was not positive or opinionated
and he did not deny that at certain moments he pondered and hesitated long before he decided on his course
but though he could keep a policy in suspense
waiting for events to guide him
he did not waver
he paused and reconsidered
but it was never his way either to go back upon a decision once made
or to waste time in vain regrets that all he expected had not been attained
he took advice readily
and left many things to his ministers but he did not lean upon his advisers
without vanity or ostentation
he was always independent
prepared to take full responsibility for his acts
that he was keenly observant of all that passed under his eyes
that his mind played freely round everything it touched
we know from the accounts of his talk
which first made him famous in the town and neighbourhood where he lived
his humour
and his memory for anecdotes which he could bring out to good purpose
at the right moment
are qualities which europe deems distinctively american
but no great man of action in the nineteenth century
even in america
possessed them in the same measure
seldom has so acute a power of observation been found united to so abundant a power of sympathy
these remarks may seem to belong to a study of his character rather than of his speeches
yet they are not irrelevant
because the interest of his speeches lies in their revelation of his character
let us
return to the speeches and to the letters
some of which
given in this volume
are scarcely less noteworthy than are the speeches
what are the distinctive merits of these speeches and letters
there is less humour in them than his reputation as a humorist would have led us to expect
they are serious
we feel that the man does not care to play over the surface of the subject
or to use it as a way of displaying his cleverness
he is trying to get right down to the very foundation of the matter and tell us what his real thoughts about it are
in this respect he sometimes reminds us of bismarck's speeches
in their rude
forth darting way
always go straight to their destined aim always hit the nail on the head
so too
in their effort to grapple with fundamental facts
lincoln's bear a sort of likeness to cromwell's speeches
though cromwell has far less power of utterance
and always seems to be wrestling with the difficulty of finding language to convey to others what is plain
true and weighty to himself
this difficulty makes the great protector
though we can usually see what he is driving at
frequently confused and obscure
is always clear
directness and breadth are the notes of his thought
and again
are the notes of his diction
the american speakers of his generation
like most of those of the preceding generation
but unlike those of that earlier generation to which alexander hamilton
john adams
marshall and madison belonged
were generally infected by a floridity which made them a by word in europe
even men of brilliant talent
such as edward everett
were by no means free from this straining after effect by highly coloured phrases and theatrical effects
such faults have to day virtually vanished from the united states
largely from a change in public taste
to which perhaps the example set by lincoln himself may have contributed
in the forties and fifties florid rhetoric was rampant
especially in the west and south
where taste was less polished than in the older states
that lincoln escaped it is a striking mark of his independence as well as of his greatness
there is no superfluous ornament in his orations
nothing tawdry
nothing otiose
for the most part
he addresses the reason of his hearers
and credits them with desiring to have none but solid arguments laid before them
when he does appeal to emotion
he does it quietly
perhaps even solemnly
the note struck is always a high note
the impressiveness of the appeal comes not from fervid vehemence of language
but from the sincerity of his own convictions
sometimes one can see that through its whole course the argument is suffused by the speaker's feeling
and when the time comes for the feeling to be directly expressed
it glows not with fitful flashes
but with the steady heat of an intense and strenuous soul
the impression which most of the speeches leave on the reader is that their matter has been carefully thought over even when the words have not been learnt by heart
but there is an anecdote that on one occasion
early in his career
lincoln went to a public meeting not in the least intending to speak
but presently being called for by the audience
rose in obedience to the call
and delivered a long address so ardent and thrilling that the reporters dropped their pencils and
absorbed in watching him
forgot to take down what he said
it has also been stated
on good authority
that on his way in the railroad cars
to the dedication of the monument on the field of gettysburg
he turned to a pennsylvanian gentleman who was sitting beside him and remarked
i suppose i shall be expected to say something this afternoon lend me a pencil and a bit of paper
and that he thereupon jotted down the notes of a speech which has become the best known and best remembered of all his utterances
so that some of its words and sentences have passed into the minds of all educated men everywhere
that famous gettysburg speech is the best example one could desire of the characteristic quality of lincoln's eloquence
it is a short speech
it is wonderfully terse in expression
it is quiet
so quiet that at the moment it did not make upon the audience
an audience wrought up by a long and highly decorated harangue from one of the prominent orators of the day
an impression at all commensurate to that which it began to make as soon as it was read over america and europe
there is in it not a touch of what we call rhetoric
or of any striving after effect
alike in thought and in language it is simple
but it states certain truths and principles in phrases so aptly chosen and so forcible
that one feels as if those truths could have been conveyed in no other words
and as if this deliverance of them were made for all time
words so simple and so strong could have come only from one who had meditated so long upon the primal facts of american history and popular government that the truths those facts taught him had become like the truths of mathematics in their clearness
their breadth
and their precision
the speeches on slavery read strange to us now
when slavery as a living system has been dead for forty years
dead and buried hell deep under the detestation of mankind
it is hard for those whose memory does not go back to 1865 to realize that down till then it was not only a terrible fact
but was defended defended by many otherwise good men
defended not only by pseudo scientific anthropologists as being in the order of nature
but by ministers of the gospel
out of the sacred scriptures
as part of the ordinances of god
lincoln's position
the position of one who had to induce slave owning fellow citizens to listen to him and admit persuasion into their heated and prejudiced minds
did not allow him to denounce it with horror
as we can all so easily do to day
but though his language is calm and restrained
he never condescends to palter with slavery
he shows its innate evils and dangers with unanswerable force
the speech on the dred scott decision is a lucid
close and cogent piece of reasoning which
in its wide view of constitutional issues
sometimes reminds one of webster
sometimes even of burke
though it does not equal the former in weight nor the latter in splendour of diction
among the letters
perhaps the most impressive is that written to mrs
the mother of five sons who had died fighting for the union in the armies of the north
it is short
and it deals with a theme on which hundreds of letters are written daily
but i do not know where the nobility of self sacrifice for a great cause
and of the consolation which the thought of a sacrifice so made should bring
is set forth with such simple and pathetic beauty
deep must be the fountains from which there issues so pure a stream
the career of lincoln is often held up to ambitious young americans as an example to show what a man may achieve by his native strength
with no advantages of birth or environment or education
in this there is nothing improper
nothing fanciful
the moral is one which may well be drawn
and in which those on whose early life fortune has not smiled may find encouragement
but the example is
after all
no great encouragement to ordinary men
for lincoln was an extraordinary man
he triumphed over the adverse conditions of his early years because nature had bestowed on him high and rare powers
superficial observers who saw his homely aspect and plain manners
and noted that his fellow townsmen
when asked why they so trusted him
answered that it was for his common sense
failed to see that his common sense was a part of his genius
what is common sense but the power of seeing the fundamentals of any practical question
and of disengaging them from the accidental and transient features that may overlie these fundamentals the power
to use a familiar expression
of getting down to bed rock
one part of this power is the faculty for perceiving what the average man will think and can be induced to do
this is what keeps the superior mind in touch with the ordinary mind
and this is perhaps why the name of common sense is used
because the superior mind seems in its power of comprehending others to be itself a part of the general sense of the community
all men of high practical capacity have this power
it is the first condition of success
but in men who have received a philosophical or literary education there is a tendency to embellish
for purposes of persuasion
or perhaps for their own gratification
the language in which they recommend their conclusions
or to state those conclusions in the light of large general principles
a tendency which may
unless carefully watched
carry them too high above the heads of the crowd
never having had such an education
spoke to the people as one of themselves
he seemed to be saying not only what each felt
but expressing the feeling just as each would have expressed it
in reality
he was quite as much above his neighbours in insight as was the polished orator or writer
but the plain directness of his language seemed to keep him on their level
his strength lay less in the form and vesture of the thought than in the thought itself
in the large
practical view which he took of the position
and thus
to repeat what has been said already
the sterling merit of these speeches of his
that which made them effective when they were delivered and makes them worth reading to day
is to be found in the justness of his conclusions and their fitness to the circumstances of the time
when he rose into higher air
when his words were clothed with stateliness and solemnity
it was the force of his conviction and the emotion that thrilled through his utterance
that printed the words deep upon the minds and drove them home to the hearts of the people
what is a great man
common speech
which after all must be our guide to the sense of the terms which the world uses
gives this name to many sorts of men
how far greatness lies in the power and range of the intellect
how far in the strength of the will
how far in elevation of view and aim and purpose
this is a question too large to be debated here
but of abraham lincoln it may be truly said that in his greatness all three elements were present
he had not the brilliance
either in thought or word or act
that dazzles
nor the restless activity that occasionally pushes to the front even persons with gifts not of the first order
he was a patient
melancholy man
whose intelligence
working sometimes slowly but always steadily and surely
was capacious enough to embrace and vigorous enough to master the incomparably difficult facts and problems he was called to deal with
his executive talent showed itself not in sudden and startling strokes
but in the calm serenity with which he formed his judgments and laid his plans
in the undismayed firmness with which he adhered to them in the face of popular clamour
of conflicting counsels from his advisers
of what others deemed all but hopeless failure
these were the qualities needed in one who had to pilot the republic through the heaviest storm that had ever broken upon it
but the mainspring of his power
and the truest evidence of his greatness
lay in the nobility of his aims
in the fervour of his conviction
in the stainless rectitude which guided his action and won for him the confidence of the people
without these things neither the vigour of his intellect nor the firmness of his will would have availed
there is a vulgar saying that all great men are unscrupulous
of him it may rather be said that the note of greatness we feel in his thinking and his speech and his conduct had its source in the loftiness and purity of his character

march 9
1832 upon the subject of education
not presuming to dictate any plan or system respecting it
i can only say that i view it as the most important subject which we
as a people
can be engaged in
that every man may receive at least a moderate education
and thereby be enabled to read the histories of his own and other countries
by which he may duly appreciate the value of our free institutions
appears to be an object of vital importance
even on this account alone
to say nothing of the advantages and satisfaction to be derived from all being able to read the scriptures and other works
both of a religious and moral nature
for themselves
for my part
i desire to see the time when education and by its means morality
and industry shall become much more general than at present and should be gratified to have it in my power to contribute something to the advancement of any measure which might have a tendency to accelerate that happy period
with regard to existing laws
some alterations are thought to be necessary
many respectable men have suggested that our estray laws the law respecting the issuing of executions
the road law
and some others are deficient in their present form
and require alterations
but considering the great probability that the framers of those laws were wiser than myself
i should prefer not meddling with them
unless they were first attacked by others
in which case i should feel it both a privilege and a duty to take that stand which
in my view
might tend to the advancement of justice
i shall conclude
considering the great degree of modesty which should always attend youth
it is probable i have already been more presuming than becomes me
upon the subjects of which i have treated
i have spoken as i have thought
i may be wrong in regard to any or all of them but
holding it a sound maxim that it is better only to be sometimes right than at all times wrong
so soon as i discover my opinions to be erroneous i shall be ready to renounce them
every man is said to have his peculiar ambition
whether it be true or not
i can say
for one
that i have no other so great as that of being truly esteemed of my fellow men by rendering myself worthy of their esteem
how far i shall succeed in gratifying this ambition is yet to be developed
i am young and unknown to many of you i was born and have ever remained in the most humble walks of life
i have no wealthy or popular relations or friends to recommend me
my case is thrown exclusively upon the independent voters of the county
and if elected
they will have conferred a favour upon me for which i shall be unremitting in my labours to compensate
but if the good people in their wisdom shall see fit to keep me in the background
i have been too familiar with disappointments to be very much chagrined
your friend and fellow citizen
letter to colonel robert allen
june 21
1836 dear colonel
i am told that during my absence last week you passed through this place
and stated publicly that you were in possession of a fact or facts which
if known to the public
would entirely destroy the prospects of n
edwards and myself at the ensuing election but that
through favour to us
you should forbear to divulge them
no one has needed favours more than i
few have been less unwilling to accept them but in this case favour to me would be injustice to the public
and therefore i must beg your pardon for declining it
that i once had the confidence of the people of sangamon
is sufficiently evident and if i have since done anything
either by design or misadventure
which if known would subject me to a forfeiture of that confidence
he that knows of that thing
and conceals it
is a traitor to his country's interest
i find myself wholly unable to form any conjecture of what fact or facts
real or supposed
you spoke but my opinion of your veracity will not permit me for a moment to doubt that you at least believed what you said
i am flattered with the personal regard you manifested for me but i do hope that
on more mature reflection
you will view the public interest as a paramount consideration
and therefore determine to let the worst come
i here assure you that the candid statement of facts on your part
however low it may sink me
shall never break the tie of personal friendship between us
i wish an answer to this
and you are at liberty to publish both
if you choose
lincoln's opinion on universal suffrage
from a letter published in the sangamon journal
june 13
1836 i go for all sharing the privileges of the government who assist in bearing its burdens
consequently i go for admitting all whites to the right of suffrage who pay taxes or bear arms by no means excluding females

1837 as a subject for the remarks of the evening the perpetuation of our political institutions is selected
in the great journal of things happening under the sun
the american people
find our account running under the date of the nineteenth century of the christian era
we find ourselves in the peaceful possession of the fairest portion of the earth
as regards extent of territory
fertility of soil
and salubrity of climate
we find ourselves under the government of a system of political institutions conducing more essentially to the ends of civil and religious liberty
than any of which the history of former times tells us
when remounting the stage of existence
found ourselves the legal inheritors of these fundamental blessings
we toiled not in the acquirement or the establishment of them they are a legacy bequeathed to us by a once hardy
and patriotic
but now lamented and departed race of ancestors
theirs was the task and nobly they performed it to possess themselves
and through themselves us
of this goodly land
and to rear upon its hills and valleys a political edifice of liberty and equal rights 'tis ours only to transmit these
the former unprofaned by the foot of the invader the latter undecayed by lapse of time
our duty to ourselves and to our posterity
and love for our species in general
imperatively require us to perform
shall we perform it
at what point shall we expect the approach of danger
by what means shall we fortify against it
shall we expect some transatlantic military giant to step across the ocean and crush us at a blow
all the armies of europe
asia and africa combined
with all the treasure of the earth our own excepted in their military chest
with a bonaparte for a commander
could not
by force
take a drink from the ohio
or make a track on the blue ridge
in a trial of a thousand years
at what point
is the approach of danger to be expected
i answer
if it ever reaches us
it must spring up among us
it cannot come from abroad
if destruction be our lot
we must ourselves be its author and finisher
as a nation of freemen
we must live through all time
or die by suicide
there is even now something of ill omen among us
i mean the increasing disregard for law which pervades the country the growing disposition to substitute wild and furious passions in lieu of the sober judgment of courts and the worse than savage mobs for the executive ministers of justice
this disposition is awfully fearful in any community and that it now exists in ours
though grating to our feelings to admit
it would be a violation of truth and an insult to our intelligence to deny
i know the american people are much attached to their government
i know they would suffer much for its sake
i know they would endure evils long and patiently before they would ever think of exchanging it for another
notwithstanding all this
if the laws be continually despised and disregarded
if their rights to be secure in their persons and property are held by no better tenure than the caprice of a mob
the alienation of their affection for the government is the natural consequence
and to that sooner or later it must come
is one point at which danger may be expected
the question recurs
how shall we fortify against it
the answer is simple
let every american
every lover of liberty
every well wisher to his posterity
swear by the blood of the revolution never to violate in the least particular the laws of the country
and never to tolerate their violation by others
as the patriots of seventy six did to the support of the declaration of independence
so to the support of the constitution and the laws let every american pledge his life
his property
and his sacred honour let every man remember that to violate the law is to trample on the blood of his father
and to tear the charter of his own and his children's liberty
let reverence for the laws be breathed by every american mother to the lisping babe that prattles on her lap
let it be taught in schools
in seminaries
and in colleges
let it be written in primers
and in almanacs
let it be preached from the pulpit
proclaimed in legislative halls
and enforced in courts of justice
in short
let it become the political religion of the nation
when i so pressingly urge a strict observance of all the laws
let me not be understood as saying that there are no bad laws
or that grievances may not arise for the redress of which no legal provisions have been made
i mean to say no such thing
but i do mean to say that although bad laws
if they exist
should be repealed as soon as possible
while they continue in force
for the sake of example they should be religiously observed
so also in unprovided cases
if such arise
let proper legal provisions be made for them with the least possible delay
but till then let them
if not too intolerable
be borne with
there is no grievance that is a fit object of redress by mob law
in any case that may arise
for instance
the promulgation of abolitionism
one of two positions is necessarily true that is
the thing is right within itself
and therefore deserves the protection of all law and all good citizens
or it is wrong
and therefore proper to be prohibited by legal enactments and in neither case is the interposition of mob law either necessary
or excusable
they histories of the revolution were pillars of the temple of liberty and now that they have crumbled away
that temple must fall unless we
their descendants
supply their places with other pillars
hewn from the solid quarry of sober reason
passion has helped us
but can do so no more
it will in future be our enemy
unimpassioned reason must furnish all the materials for our future support and defence
let those materials be moulded into general intelligence
sound morality
in particular
a reverence for the constitution and laws and that we improved to the last
that we remained free to the last
that we revered his name to the last
that during his long sleep we permitted no hostile foot to pass over or desecrate his resting place
shall be that which to learn the last trump shall awaken our washington
upon these let the proud fabric of freedom rest
as the rock of its basis and as truly as has been said of the only greater institution
the gates of hell shall not prevail against it
many great and good men
sufficiently qualified for any task they should undertake
may ever be found
whose ambition would aspire to nothing beyond a seat in congress
a gubernatorial or a presidential chair
but such belong not to the family of the lion or the brood of the eagle
think you these places would satisfy an alexander
a c sar
or a napoleon
towering genius disdains a beaten path
it seeks regions hitherto unexplored
it sees no distinction in adding story to story upon the monuments of fame erected to the memory of others
it denies that it is glory enough to serve under any chief
it scorns to tread in the footsteps of any predecessor
however illustrious
it thirsts and burns for distinction and
if possible
it will have it
whether at the expense of emancipating slaves
or enslaving free men
is it unreasonable
to expect that some men
possessed of the loftiest genius
coupled with ambition sufficient to push it to its utmost stretch
will at some time spring up among us
and when such a one does
it will require the people to be united with each other
attached to the government and laws
and generally intelligent
to successfully frustrate his design
distinction will be his paramount object
and although he would as willingly
perhaps more so
acquire it by doing good as harm
yet that opportunity being passed
and nothing left to be done in the way of building up
he would sit down boldly to the task of pulling down
is a probable case
highly dangerous
and such a one as could not well have existed heretofore
all honour to our revolutionary ancestors
to whom we are indebted for these institutions
they will not be forgotten
in history we hope they will be read of
and recounted
so long as the bible shall be read
but even granting that they will
their influence cannot be what it heretofore has been
even then
they cannot be so universally known
nor so vividly felt
as they were by the generation just gone to rest
at the close of that struggle
nearly every adult male had been a participator in some of its scenes
the consequence was
that of those scenes
in the form of a husband
a father
a son
or a brother
a living history was to be found in every family
a history bearing the indubitable testimonies to its own authenticity in the limbs mangled
in the scars of wounds received in the midst of the very scenes related a history
that could be read and understood alike by all
the wise and the ignorant
the learned and the unlearned
but those histories are gone
they can be read no more for ever
they were a fortress of strength but what the invading foemen could never do
the silent artillery of time has done
the levelling of its walls
they are gone
they were a forest of giant oaks but the resistless hurricane has swept over them
and left only here and there a lonely trunk
despoiled of its verdure
shorn of its foliage
unshading and unshaded
to murmur in a few more gentle breezes
and to combat with its mutilated limbs a few more ruder storms
and then to sink and be no more
humorous account of his experiences with a lady he was requested to marry a letter to mrs
april 1
1838 dear madam
without apologising for being egotistical
i shall make the history of so much of my life as has elapsed since i saw you the subject of this letter
by the way
i now discover that in order to give a full and intelligible account of the things i have done and suffered since i saw you
i shall necessarily have to relate some that happened before
it was
in the autumn of 1836 that a married lady of my acquaintance
and who was a great friend of mine
being about to pay a visit to her father and other relatives residing in kentucky
proposed to me that on her return she would bring a sister of hers with her on condition that i would engage to become her brother in law with all convenient dispatch
of course
accepted the proposal
for you know i could not have done otherwise had i really been averse to it but privately
between you and me
i was most confoundedly well pleased with the project
i had seen the said sister some three years before
thought her intelligent and agreeable
and saw no good objection to plodding life through hand in hand with her
time passed on
the lady took her journey
and in due time returned
sister in company
sure enough
this astonished me a little
for it appeared to me that her coming so readily showed that she was a trifle too willing
but on reflection it occurred to me that she might have been prevailed on by her married sister to come
without anything concerning me having been mentioned to her
and so i concluded that if no other objection presented itself
i would consent to waive this
all this occurred to me on hearing of her arrival in the neighbourhood for
be it remembered
i had not yet seen her
except about three years previous
as above mentioned
in a few days we had an interview
although i had seen her before
she did not look as my imagination had pictured her
i knew she was over size
but she now appeared a fair match for falstaff
i knew she was called an old maid
and i felt no doubt of the truth of at least half of the appellation
but now
when i beheld her
i could not for my life avoid thinking of my mother and this
not from withered features
for her skin was too full of fat to permit of its contracting into wrinkles but from her want of teeth
weather beaten appearance in general
and from a kind of notion that ran in my head that nothing could have commenced at the size of infancy and reached her present bulk in less than thirty five or forty years and
in short
i was not at all pleased with her
but what could i do
i had told her sister that i would take her for better or for worse
and i made a point of honour and conscience in all things to stick to my word
especially if others had been induced to act on it
which in this case i had no doubt they had
for i was now fairly convinced that no other man on earth would have her
and hence the conclusion that they were bent on holding me to my bargain
thought i
i have said it
be the consequences what they may
it shall not be my fault if i fail to do it
at once i determined to consider her my wife
and this done
all my powers of discovery were put to work in search of perfections in her which might be fairly set off against her defects
i tried to imagine her handsome
but for her unfortunate corpulency
was actually true
exclusive of this
no woman that i have ever seen has a finer face
i also tried to convince myself that the mind was much more to be valued than the person
and in this she was not inferior
as i could discover
to any with whom i had been acquainted
shortly after this
without attempting to come to any positive understanding with her
i set out for vandalia
when and where you first saw me
during my stay there i had letters from her which did not change my opinion of either her intellect or intention
on the contrary
confirmed it in both
all this while
although i was fixed firm as the surge repelling rock in my resolution
i found i was continually repenting the rashness which had led me to make it
through life i have been in no bondage
either real or imaginary
from the thraldom of which i so much desired to be free
after my return home i saw nothing to change my opinion of her in any particular
she was the same
and so was i
i now spent my time in planning how i might get along in life after my contemplated change of circumstances should have taken place
and how i might procrastinate the evil day for a time
which i really dreaded as much
perhaps more
than an irishman does the halter
after all my sufferings upon this deeply interesting subject
here i am
completely out of the scrape
and i now want to know if you can guess how i got out of it out
in every sense of the term no violation of word
or conscience
i don't believe you can guess
and so i might as well tell you at once
as the lawyer says
it was done in the manner following
to wit
after i had delayed the matter as long as i thought i could in honour do which
by the way
had brought me round into the last fall
i concluded i might as well bring it to a consummation without further delay
and so i mustered my resolution and made the proposal to her direct but
shocking to relate
she answered
at first i supposed she did it through an affectation of modesty
which i thought but ill became her under the peculiar circumstances of the case
but on my renewal of the charge i found she repelled it with greater firmness than before
i tried it again and again
but with the same success
or rather with the same want of success
i finally was forced to give it up
at which i very unexpectedly found myself mortified almost beyond endurance
i was mortified
it seemed to me
in a hundred different ways
my vanity was deeply wounded by the reflection that i had so long been too stupid to discover her intentions
and at the same time never doubting that i understood them perfectly and also that she
whom i had taught myself to believe nobody else would have
had actually rejected me with all my fancied greatness
to cap the whole
i then for the first time began to suspect that i was really a little in love with her
but let it all go
i'll try and outlive it
others have been made fools of by the girls
but this can never in truth be said of me
i most emphatically
in this instance
made a fool of myself
i have now come to the conclusion never again to think of marrying
and for this reason i can never be satisfied with any one who would be blockhead enough to have me
when you receive this
write me a long yarn about something to amuse me
give my respects to mr
from a debate between lincoln
and others against douglas
and others
december 1839
lamborn insists that the difference between the van buren party and the whigs is
that although the former sometimes err in practice
they are always correct in principle
whereas the latter are wrong in principle and the better to impress this proposition
he uses a figurative expression in these words
the democrats are vulnerable in the heel
but they are sound in the heart and in the head
the first branch of the figure that is
that the democrats are vulnerable in the heel i admit is not merely figuratively but literally true
who that looks but for a moment at their swartwouts
their prices
their harringtons
and their hundreds of others
scampering away with the public money to texas
to europe
and to every spot of the earth where a villain may hope to find refuge from justice
can at all doubt that they are most distressingly affected in their heels with a species of running fever
it seems that this malady of their heels operates on the sound headed and honest hearted creatures very much like the cork leg in the song did on its owner
when he had once got started on it
the more he tried to stop it
the more it would run away
at the hazard of wearing this point threadbare
i will relate an anecdote which seems to be too strikingly in point to be omitted
a witty irish soldier who was always boasting of his bravery when no danger was near
but who invariably retreated without orders at the first charge of the engagement
being asked by his captain why he did so
i have as brave a heart as julius c sar ever had but somehow or other
whenever danger approaches
my cowardly legs will run away with it
so it is with mr
lamborn's party
they take the public money into their hands for the most laudable purpose that wise heads and honest hearts can dictate
but before they can possibly get it out again
their rascally vulnerable heels will run away with them
letter to w
october 31
1840 dear sir
your note of yesterday is received
in the difficulty between us of which you speak
you say you think i was the aggressor
i do not think i was
you say my words imported insult
i meant them as a fair set off to your own statements
and not otherwise and in that light alone i now wish you to understand them
you ask for my present feelings on the subject
i entertain no unkind feelings to you
and none of any sort upon the subject
except a sincere regret that i permitted myself to get into such an altercation
extract from a letter to john t
springfield illinois
january 23
1841 for not giving you a general summary of news
you must pardon me it is not in my power to do so
i am now the most miserable man living
if what i feel were equally distributed to the whole human family
there would not be one cheerful face on earth
whether i shall ever be better
i cannot tell i awfully forebode i shall not
to remain as i am is impossible i must die or be better
it appears to me
the matter you speak of on my account you may attend to as you say
unless you shall hear of my condition forbidding it
i say this because i fear i shall be unable to attend to any business here
and a change of scene might help me
if i could be myself
i would rather remain at home with judge logan
i can write no more
from an address before the washingtonian temperance society
february 22
1842 although the temperance cause has been in progress for nearly twenty years
it is apparent to all that it is just now being crowned with a degree of success hitherto unparalleled
the list of its friends is daily swelled by the additions of fifties
of hundreds
and of thousands
the cause itself seems suddenly transformed from a cold abstract theory to a living
active and powerful chieftain
going forth conquering and to conquer
the citadels of his great adversary are daily being stormed and dismantled his temples and his altars
where the rites of his idolatrous worship have long been performed
and where human sacrifices have long been wont to be made
are daily desecrated and deserted
the trump of the conqueror's fame is sounding from hill to hill
from sea to sea
and from land to land
and calling millions to his standard at a blast
but
say some
we are no drunkards
and we shall not acknowledge ourselves such by joining a reform drunkard's society
whatever our influence might be
surely no christian will adhere to this objection
if they believe
as they profess
that omnipotence condescended to take on himself the form of sinful man
as such
to die an ignominious death for their sakes
surely they will not refuse submission to the infinitely lesser condescension for the temporal and perhaps eternal salvation of a large
and unfortunate class of their fellow creatures nor is the condescension very great
in my judgment
such of us as have never fallen victims have been spared more from the absence of appetite
than from any mental or moral superiority over those who have
indeed i believe
if we take habitual drunkards as a class
their heads and their hearts will bear an advantageous comparison with those of any other class
there seems ever to have been a proneness in the brilliant and warm blooded to fall into this vice
the demon of intemperance ever seems to have delighted in sucking the blood of genius and generosity
what one of us but can call to mind some relative more promising in youth than all his fellows
who has fallen a sacrifice to his rapacity
he ever seems to have gone forth like the egyptian angel of death
commissioned to slay
if not the first
the fairest born of every family
shall he now be arrested in his desolating career
in that arrest all can give aid that will and who shall be excused that can and will not
far around as human breath has ever blown
he keeps our fathers
our brothers
our sons
and our friends prostrate in the chains of moral death
when the conduct of men is designed to be influenced
unassuming persuasion
should ever be adopted
it is an old and a true maxim that a drop of honey catches more flies than a gallon of gall
so with men
if you would win a man to your cause
first convince him that you are his sincere friend
therein is a drop of honey that catches his heart
say what you will
is the great high road to his reason
and which
when once gained
you will find but little trouble in convincing his judgment of the justice of your cause
if indeed that cause really be a just one
on the contrary
assume to dictate to his judgment
or to command his action
or to mark him as one to be shunned and despised
and he will retreat within himself
close all the avenues to his head and his heart and though your cause be naked truth itself
transformed to the heaviest lance
harder than steel
and sharper than steel can be made
and though you throw it with more than herculean force and precision
you shall be no more able to pierce him than to penetrate the hard shell of a tortoise with a rye straw
such is man
and so must he be understood by those who would lead him
even to his own best interests
another error
as it seems to me
into which the old reformers fell
was the position that all habitual drunkards were utterly incorrigible
and therefore must be turned adrift and damned without remedy in order that the grace of temperance might abound
to the temperate then
and to all mankind some hundreds of years thereafter
there is in this something so repugnant to humanity
so uncharitable
so cold blooded and feelingless
that it never did
nor never can enlist the enthusiasm of a popular cause
we could not love the man who taught it we could not hear him with patience
the heart could not throw open its portals to it
the generous man could not adopt it it could not mix with his blood
it looked so fiendishly selfish
so like throwing fathers and brothers overboard to lighten the boat for our security
that the noble minded shrank from the manifest meanness of the thing
and besides this
the benefits of a reformation to be effected by such a system were too remote in point of time to warmly engage many in its behalf
few can be induced to labour exclusively for posterity and none will do it enthusiastically
posterity has done nothing for us and theorize on it as we may
practically we shall do very little for it
unless we are made to think we are at the same time doing something for ourselves
what an ignorance of human nature does it exhibit
to ask or expect a whole community to rise up and labour for the temporal happiness of others
after themselves shall be consigned to the dust
a majority of which community take no pains whatever to secure their own eternal welfare at no more distant day
great distance in either time or space has wonderful power to lull and render quiescent the human mind
pleasures to be enjoyed
or pains to be endured
after we shall be dead and gone
are but little regarded even in our own cases
and much less in the cases of others
in addition to this there is something so ludicrous in promises of good or threats of evil a great way off as to render the whole subject with which they are connected easily turned into ridicule
better lay down that spade you are stealing
paddy if you don't you'll pay for it at the day of judgment
be the powers
if ye'll credit me so long i'll take another jist
from the circular of the whig committee
an address to the people of illinois
march 4
the system of loans is but temporary in its nature
and must soon explode
it is a system not only ruinous while it lasts
but one that must soon fail and leave us destitute
as an individual who undertakes to live by borrowing soon finds his original means devoured by interest
and next
no one left to borrow from
so must it be with a government
we repeat
that a tariff sufficient for revenue
or a direct tax
must soon be resorted to and
we believe this alternative is now denied by no one
but which system shall be adopted
some of our opponents in theory admit the propriety of a tariff sufficient for revenue
but even they will not in practice vote for such a tariff while others boldly advocate direct taxation
as some of them boldly advocate direct taxation
and all the rest or so nearly all as to make exceptions needless refuse to adopt the tariff
we think it is doing them no injustice to class them all as advocates of direct taxation
we believe they are only delaying an open avowal of the system till they can assure themselves that the people will tolerate it
let us
briefly compare the two systems
the tariff is the cheaper system
because the duties
being collected in large parcels
at a few commercial points
will require comparatively few officers in their collection while by the direct tax system the land must be literally covered with assessors and collectors
going forth like swarms of egyptian locusts
devouring every blade of grass and other green thing
by the tariff system the whole revenue is paid by the consumers of foreign goods
and those chiefly the luxuries and not the necessaries of life
by this system
the man who contents himself to live upon the products of his own country pays nothing at all
and surely that country is extensive enough
and its products abundant and varied enough
to answer all the real wants of its people
in short
by this system the burden of revenue falls almost entirely on the wealthy and luxurious few
while the substantial and labouring many
who live at home and upon home products
go entirely free
by the direct tax system
none can escape
however strictly the citizen may exclude from his premises all foreign luxuries
fine cloths
fine silks
rich wines
golden chains
and diamond rings
for the possession of his house
his barn
and his homespun he is to be perpetually haunted and harassed by the tax gatherer
with these views
we leave it to be determined whether we or our opponents are more truly democratic on the subject
from a letter to martin m
march 26
1843 it is truly gratifying to me to learn that while the people of sangamon have cast me off
my old friends of menard
who have known me longest and best
stick to me
it would astonish
if not amuse
the older citizens to learn that i a stranger
penniless boy
working on a flatboat at ten dollars per month have been put down here as the candidate of pride
and aristocratic family distinction
yet so
it was
there was
the strangest combination of church influence against me
baker is a campbellite and therefore
as i suppose
with few exceptions
got all that church
my wife has some relations in the presbyterian churches
and some with the episcopal churches and therefore
wherever it would tell
i was set down as either the one or the other
while it was everywhere contended that no christian ought to go for me
because i belonged to no church
was suspected of being a deist
and had talked about fighting a duel
with all these things
of course
had nothing to do
nor do i complain of them
as to his own church going for him
i think that was right enough
and as to the influences i have spoken of in the other
though they were very strong
it would be grossly untrue and unjust to charge that they acted upon them in a body
or were very near so
i only mean that those influences levied a tax of a considerable per cent
upon my strength throughout the religious controversy
but enough of this

1846 we have another boy
born the 10th of march
he is very much such a child as bob was at his age
rather of a longer order
bob is short and low
and i expect always will be
he talks very plainly almost as plainly as anybody
he is quite smart enough
i sometimes fear that he is one of the little rare ripe sort that are smarter at about five than ever after
he has a great deal of that sort of mischief that is the offspring of such animal spirits
since i began this letter
a messenger came to tell me bob was lost but by the time i reached the house his mother had found him and had him whipped
and by now
very likely
he is run away again

1848 dear william
your letter of december 27th was received a day or two ago
i am much obliged to you for the trouble you have taken
and promise to take in my little business there
as to speech making
by way of getting the hang of the house
i made a little speech two or three days ago on a post office question of no general interest
i find speaking here and elsewhere about the same thing
i was about as badly scared
and no worse
as i am when i speak in court
i expect to make one within a week or two
in which i hope to succeed well enough to wish you to see it
it is very pleasant to learn from you that there are some who desire that i should be re elected
i most heartily thank them for their partiality and i can say
as mr
clay said of the annexation of texas
that personally i would not object to a re election
although i thought at the time
and still think
it would be quite as well for me to return to the law at the end of a single term
i made the declaration that i would not be a candidate again
more from a wish to deal fairly with others
to keep peace among our friends
and to keep the district from going to the enemy
than for any cause personal to myself so that
if it should so happen that nobody else wishes to be elected
i could refuse the people the right of sending me again
but to enter myself as a competitor of others
or to authorize any one so to enter me
is what my word and honour forbid

1848 as to the young men
you must not wait to be brought forward by the older men
for instance
do you suppose that i should ever have got into notice if i had waited to be hunted up and pushed forward by older men
you young men get together and form a rough and ready club
and have regular meetings and speeches
take in everybody you can get
harrison grimsley
lee kimball and c
matheny will do to begin the thing but as you go along gather up all the shrewd
wild boys about town
whether just of age or a little under age chris
reddick ridgley
lewis zwizler
and hundreds such
let every one play the part he can play best
some speak
some sing
and all holler
your meetings will be of evenings the older men
and the women
will go to hear you so that it will not only contribute to the election of old zach
but will be an interesting pastime
and improving to the intellectual faculties of all engaged
don't fail to do this

july 10
1848 the way for a young man to rise is to improve himself every way he can
never suspecting that anybody wishes to hinder him
allow me to assure you that suspicion and jealousy never did help any man in any situation
there may sometimes be ungenerous attempts to keep a young man down and they will succeed
if he allows his mind to be diverted from its true channel to brood over the attempted injury
cast about
and see if this feeling has not injured every person you have ever known to fall into it

january 2
1851 dear johnston
your request for eighty dollars i do not think it best to comply with now
at the various times when i have helped you a little you have said to me
we can get along very well now but in a very short time i find you in the same difficulty again
this can only happen by some defect in your conduct
what that defect is
i think i know
you are not lazy
and still you are an idler
i doubt whether
since i saw you
you have done a good whole day's work in any one day
you do not very much dislike to work
and still you do not work much
merely because it does not seem to you that you could get much for it
this habit of uselessly wasting time is the whole difficulty it is vastly important to you
and still more so to your children
that you should break the habit
it is more important to them
because they have longer to live
and can keep out of an idle habit before they are in it
easier than they can get out after they are in
you are now in need of some money and what i propose is
that you shall go to work
tooth and nail
for somebody who will give you money for it
let father and your boys take charge of your things at home
prepare for a crop
and make the crop
and you go to work for the best money wages
or in discharge of any debt you owe
that you can get and
to secure you a fair reward for your labour
i now promise you
that for every dollar you will
between this and the first of may
get for your own labour
either in money or as your own indebtedness
i will then give you one other dollar
by this
if you hire yourself at ten dollars a month
from me you will get ten more
making twenty dollars a month for your work
in this i do not mean you shall go off to st
or the lead mines
or the gold mines in california
but i mean for you to go at it for the best wages you can get close to home in coles county
if you will do this
you will be soon out of debt
what is better
you will have a habit that will keep you from getting in debt again
if i should now clear you out of debt
next year you would be just as deep in as ever
you say you would almost give your place in heaven for seventy or eighty dollars
then you value your place in heaven very cheap
for i am sure you can
with the offer i make
get the seventy or eighty dollars for four or five months' work
you say if i will furnish you the money you will deed me the land
if you don't pay the money back
you will deliver possession
if you can't now live with the land
how will you then live without it
you have always been kind to me
and i do not mean to be unkind to you
on the contrary
if you will but follow my advice
you will find it worth more than eighty times eighty dollars to you
letter to john d
november 4
1851 dear brother
when i came into charleston day before yesterday
i learned that you are anxious to sell the land where you live and move to missouri
i have been thinking of this ever since
and cannot but think such a notion is utterly foolish
what can you do in missouri better than here
is the land any richer
can you there
any more than here
raise corn and wheat and oats without work
will anybody there
any more than here
do your work for you
if you intend to go to work
there is no better place than right where you are if you do not intend to go to work
you cannot get along anywhere
squirming and crawling about from place to place can do no good
you have raised no crop this year and what you really want is to sell the land
get the money
and spend it
part with the land you have
my life upon it
you will never after own a spot big enough to bury you in
half you will get for the land you will spend in moving to missouri
and the other half you will eat
and wear out
and no foot of land will be bought
i feel it my duty to have no hand in such a piece of foolery
i feel that it is so even on your own account
and particularly on mother's account
the eastern forty acres i intend to keep for mother while she lives if you will not cultivate it
it will rent for enough to support her at least
it will rent for something
her dower in the other two forties she can let you have
and no thanks to me
do not misunderstand this letter i do not write it in any unkindness
i write it in order
if possible
to get you to face the truth
which truth is
you are destitute because you have idled away all your time
your thousand pretences for not getting along better are all nonsense they deceive nobody but yourself
go to work is the only cure for your case
a word to mother
chapman tells me he wants you to go and live with him
if i were you i would try it awhile
if you get tired of it as i think you will not
you can return to your own home
chapman feels very kindly to you
and i have no doubt he will make your situation very pleasant
note for law lecture
written about july 1
1850 i am not an accomplished lawyer
i find quite as much material for a lecture in those points wherein i have failed
as in those wherein i have been moderately successful
the leading rule for a lawyer
as for the man of every other calling
is diligence
leave nothing for to morrow which can be done to day
never let your correspondence fall behind
whatever piece of business you have in hand
before stopping
do all the labour pertaining to it which can then be done
when you bring a common law suit
if you have the facts for doing so
write the declaration at once
if a law point be involved
examine the books
and note the authority you rely on upon the declaration itself
where you are sure to find it when wanted
the same of defences and pleas
in business not likely to be litigated
ordinary collection cases
and the like
make all examinations of titles
and note them and even draft orders and decrees in advance
the course has a triple advantage it avoids omissions and neglect
saves your labour when once done
performs the labour out of court when you have leisure
rather than in court when you have not
extemporaneous speaking should be practised and cultivated
it is the lawyer's avenue to the public
however able and faithful he may be in other respects
people are slow to bring him business if he cannot make a speech
and yet there is not a more fatal error to young lawyers than relying too much on speech making
if any one
upon his rare powers of speaking
shall claim an exemption from the drudgery of the law
his case is a failure in advance
discourage litigation
persuade your neighbours to compromise whenever you can
point out to them how the nominal winner is often a real loser in fees
and waste of time
as a peace maker the lawyer has a superior opportunity of being a good man
there will still be business enough
never stir up litigation
a worse man can scarcely be found than one who does this
who can be more nearly a fiend than he who habitually overhauls the register of deeds in search of defects in titles
whereon to stir up strife
and put money in his pocket
a moral tone ought to be infused into the profession which should drive such men out of it
the matter of fees is important
far beyond the mere question of bread and butter involved
properly attended to
fuller justice is done to both lawyer and client
an exorbitant fee should never be claimed
as a general rule
never take your whole fee in advance
nor any more than a small retainer
when fully paid beforehand
you are more than a common mortal if you can feel the same interest in the case as if something was still in prospect for you
as well as for your client
and when you lack interest in the case the job will very likely lack skill and diligence in the performance
settle the amount of fee and take a note in advance
then you will feel that you are working for something
and you are sure to do your work faithfully and well
never sell a fee note at least not before the consideration service is performed
it leads to negligence and dishonesty negligence by losing interest in the case
and dishonesty in refusing to refund when you have allowed the consideration to fail
there is a vague popular belief that lawyers are necessarily dishonest
i say vague
because when we consider to what extent confidence and honours are reposed in and conferred upon lawyers by the people
it appears improbable that their impression of dishonesty is very distinct and vivid
yet the impression is common
almost universal
let no young man choosing the law for a calling for a moment yield to the popular belief
resolve to be honest at all events and if in your own judgment you cannot be an honest lawyer
resolve to be honest without being a lawyer
choose some other occupation
rather than one in the choosing of which you do
in advance
consent to be a knave
a fragment
written about july 1
1854 equality in society alike beats inequality
whether the latter be of the british aristocratic sort or of the domestic slavery sort
we know southern men declare that their slaves are better off than hired labourers amongst us
how little they know whereof they speak
there is no permanent class of hired labourers amongst us
twenty five years ago i was a hired labourer
the hired labourer of yesterday labours on his own account to day
and will hire others to labour for him to morrow
advancement improvement in condition is the order of things in a society of equals
as labour is the common burden of our race
so the effort of some to shift their share of the burden on to the shoulders of others is the great durable curse of the race
originally a curse for transgression upon the whole race
as by slavery
it is concentrated on a part only
it becomes the double refined curse of god upon his creatures
free labour has the inspiration of hope pure slavery has no hope
the power of hope upon human exertion and happiness is wonderful
the slave master himself has a conception of it
and hence the system of tasks among slaves
the slave whom you cannot drive with the lash to break seventy five pounds of hemp in a day
if you will task him to break a hundred
and promise him pay for all he does over
he will break you a hundred and fifty
you have substituted hope for the rod
and yet perhaps it does not occur to you that
to the extent of your gain in the case
you have given up the slave system and adopted the free system of labour
a fragment on slavery
july 1854 if a can prove
however conclusively
that he may of right enslave b
why may not b snatch the same argument and prove equally that he may enslave a
you say a is white and b is black
it is colour
then the lighter having the right to enslave the darker
take care
by this rule you are to be slave to the first man you meet with a fairer skin than your own
you do not mean colour exactly
you mean the whites are intellectually the superiors of the blacks
and therefore have the right to enslave them
take care again
by this rule you are to be slave to the first man you meet with an intellect superior to your own
say you
it is a question of interest
and if you make it your interest you have the right to enslave another
very well
and if he can make it his interest he has the right to enslave you
lincoln's reply to senator douglas at peoria
the origin of the wilmot proviso
october 16
our war with mexico broke out in 1846
when congress was about adjourning that session
president polk asked them to place two millions of dollars under his control
to be used by him in the recess
if found practicable and expedient
in negotiating a treaty of peace with mexico
and acquiring some part of her territory
a bill was duly gotten up for the purpose
and was progressing swimmingly in the house of representatives
when a democratic member from pennsylvania by the name of david wilmot moved as an amendment
that in any territory thus acquired there shall never be slavery
this is the origin of the far famed wilmot proviso
it created a great flutter but it stuck like wax
was voted into the bill
and the bill passed with it through the house
the senate
adjourned without final action on it
and so both the appropriation and the proviso were lost for the time
this declared indifference
as i must think
covert zeal
for the spread of slavery
i cannot but hate
i hate it because of the monstrous injustice of slavery itself
i hate it because it deprives our republican example of its just influence in the world
enables the enemies of free institutions with plausibility to taunt us as hypocrites
causes the real friends of freedom to doubt our sincerity
and especially because it forces so many good men amongst ourselves into an open war with the very fundamental principles of civil liberty
criticizing the declaration of independence
and insisting that there is no right principle of action but self interest
before proceeding let me say that i think i have no prejudice against the southern people
they are just what we would be in their situation
if slavery did not now exist among them
they would not introduce it
if it did now exist among us
we should not instantly give it up
this i believe of the masses north and south
doubtless there are individuals on both sides who would not hold slaves under any circumstances
and others who would gladly introduce slavery anew if it were out of existence
we know that some southern men do free their slaves
go north and become tip top abolitionists
while some northern ones go south and become most cruel slave masters
when southern people tell us they are no more responsible for the origin of slavery than we are
i acknowledge the fact
when it is said that the institution exists
and that it is very difficult to get rid of it in any satisfactory way
i can understand and appreciate the saying
i surely will not blame them for not doing what i should not know how to do myself
if all earthly power were given me
i should not know what to do as to the existing institution
my first impulse would be to free all the slaves
and send them to liberia
to their own native land
but a moment's reflection would convince me that whatever of high hope as i think there is there may be in this in the long run
its sudden execution is impossible
if they were all landed there in a day
they would all perish in the next ten days and there are not surplus shipping and surplus money enough to carry them there in many times ten days
what then
free them all
and keep them among us as underlings
is it quite certain that this betters their condition
i think i would not hold one in slavery at any rate
yet the point is not clear enough for me to denounce people upon
what next
free them
and make them politically and socially our equals
my own feelings will not admit of this
and if mine would
we well know that those of the great mass of whites will not
whether this feeling accords with justice and sound judgment is not the sole question
if indeed it is any part of it
a universal feeling
whether well or ill founded
cannot be safely disregarded
we cannot then make them equals
it does seem to me that systems of gradual emancipation might be adopted
but for their tardiness in this i will not undertake to judge our brethren of the south
equal justice to the south
it is said
requires us to consent to the extension of slavery to new countries
that is to say
that inasmuch as you do not object to my taking my hog to nebraska
therefore i must not object to your taking your slave
i admit that this is perfectly logical
if there is no difference between hogs and slaves
but while you thus require me to deny the humanity of the negro
i wish to ask whether you of the south
have ever been willing to do as much
it is kindly provided that of all those who come into the world
only a small percentage are natural tyrants
that percentage is no larger in the slave states than in the free
the great majority
south as well as north
have human sympathies
of which they can no more divest themselves than they can of their sensibility to physical pain
these sympathies in the bosoms of the southern people manifest in many ways their sense of the wrong of slavery
and their consciousness that
after all
there is humanity in the negro
if they deny this let me address them a few plain questions
in 1820 you joined the north almost unanimously in declaring the african slave trade piracy
and in annexing to it the punishment of death
why did you do this
if you did not feel that it was wrong
why did you join in providing that men should be hung for it
the practice was no more than bringing wild negroes from africa to such as would buy them
but you never thought of hanging men for catching and selling wild horses
wild buffaloes
or wild bears
you have among you a sneaking individual of the class of native tyrants known as the slave dealer
he watches your necessities
and crawls up to buy your slave at a speculating price
if you cannot help it
you sell to him but if you can help it
you drive him from your door
you despise him utterly you do not recognize him as a friend
or even as an honest man
your children must not play with his they may rollick freely with the little negroes
but not with the slave dealer's children
if you are obliged to deal with him
you try to get through the job without so much as touching him
it is common with you to join hands with the men you meet but with the slave dealer you avoid the ceremony
instinctively shrinking from the snaky contact
if he grows rich and retires from business
you still remember him
and still keep up the ban of non intercourse upon him and his family
why is this
you do not so treat the man who deals in cotton
or tobacco
and yet again
there are in the united states and territories
including the district of columbia
over four hundred and thirty thousand free blacks
at five hundred dollars per head
they are worth over two hundred millions of dollars
how comes this vast amount of property to be running about without owners
we do not see free horses or free cattle running at large
how is this
all these free blacks are the descendants of slaves
or have been slaves themselves and they would be slaves now but for something that has operated on their white owners
inducing them at vast pecuniary sacrifice to liberate them
what is that something
is there any mistaking it
in all these cases it is your sense of justice and human sympathy continually telling you that the poor negro has some natural right to himself
that those who deny it and make mere merchandise of him deserve kickings
and death
and now why will you ask us to deny the humanity of the slave
and estimate him as only the equal of the hog
why ask us to do what you will not do yourselves
why ask us to do for nothing what two hundred millions of dollars could not induce you to do
but one great argument in support of the repeal of the missouri compromise is still to come
that argument is the sacred right of self government
some poet has said
fools rush in where angels fear to tread
at the hazard of being thought one of the fools of this quotation
i meet that argument
i rush in
i take that bull by the horns
my faith in the proposition that each man should do precisely as he pleases with all which is exclusively his own
lies at the foundation of the sense of justice there is in me
i extend the principle to communities of men as well as to individuals
i so extend it because it is politically wise as well as naturally just
politically wise in saving us from broils about matters which do not concern us
or at washington
i would not trouble myself with the oyster laws of virginia
or the cranberry laws of indiana
the doctrine of self government is right
absolutely and internally right but it has no just application as here attempted
or perhaps i should rather say that whether it has any application here depends upon whether a negro is not or is a man
if he is not a man
in that case he who is a man may
as a matter of self government
do just what he pleases with him
but if the negro is a man
is it not to that extent a total destruction of self government to say that he
shall not govern himself
when the white man governs himself
that is self government but when he governs himself and also governs another man
that is more than self government
that is despotism
if the negro is a man
then my ancient faith teaches me that all men are created equal
and that there can be no moral right in connection with one man's making a slave of another
judge douglas frequently
with bitter irony and sarcasm
paraphrases our argument by saying
the white people of nebraska are good enough to govern themselves
but they are not good enough to govern a few miserable negroes
well
i doubt not that the people of nebraska are and will continue to be as good as the average of people elsewhere
i do not say the contrary
what i do say is that no man is good enough to govern another man without that other's consent
i say this is the leading principle
the sheet anchor of american republicanism
slavery is founded in the selfishness of man's nature
opposition to it in his love of justice
these principles are in eternal antagonism
and when brought into collision so fiercely as slavery extension brings them
shocks and throes and convulsions must ceaselessly follow
repeal the missouri compromise repeal all compromises repeal the declaration of independence repeal all past history
you still cannot repeal human nature
it still will be the abundance of man's heart that slavery extension is wrong
and out of the abundance of his heart his mouth will continue to speak
the missouri compromise ought to be restored
slavery may or may not be established in nebraska
but whether it be or not
we shall have repudiated discarded from the councils of the nation the spirit of compromise for who
after this
will ever trust in a national compromise
the spirit of mutual concession that spirit which first gave us the constitution
and has thrice saved the union we shall have strangled and cast from us for ever
and what shall we have in lieu of it
the south flushed with triumph and tempted to excess the north betrayed
as they believed
brooding on wrong and burning for revenge
one side will provoke
the other resent
the one will taunt
the other defy one aggresses
the other retaliates
already a few in the north defy all constitutional restraints
resist the execution of the fugitive slave law
and even menace the institution of slavery in the states where it exists
already a few in the south claim the constitutional right to take and hold slaves in the free states
demand the revival of the slave trade
and demand a treaty with great britain by which fugitive slaves may be reclaimed from canada
as yet they are but few on either side
it is a grave question for lovers of the union
whether the final destruction of the missouri compromise
and with it the spirit of all compromise
will or will not embolden and embitter each of these
and fatally increase the number of both
some men
mostly whigs
who condemn the repeal of the missouri compromise
nevertheless hesitate to go for its restoration
lest they be thrown in company with the abolitionists
will they allow me
as an old whig
to tell them good humouredly that i think this is very silly
stand with anybody that stands right
stand with him while he is right
and part with him when he goes wrong
stand with the abolitionist in restoring the missouri compromise
and stand against him when he attempts to repeal the fugitive slave law
in the latter case you stand with the southern disunionist
what of that
you are still right
in both cases you are right in both cases you expose the dangerous extremes
in both you stand on the middle ground and hold the ship level and steady
in both you are national
and nothing less than national
this is the good old whig ground
to desert such ground because of any company is to be less than a whig
less than a man
less than an american
i particularly object to the new position which the avowed principle of this nebraska law gives to slavery in the body politic
i object to it because it assumes that there can be moral right in the enslaving of one man by another
i object to it as a dangerous dalliance for free people a sad evidence that
feeling over prosperity
we forget right that liberty as a principle we have ceased to revere
i object to it because the fathers of the republic eschewed and rejected it
the argument of necessity was the only argument they ever admitted in favour of slavery
and so far
and so far only as it carried them
did they ever go
they found the institution existing among us
which they could not help
and they cast the blame on the british king for having permitted its introduction
thus we see the plain
unmistakable spirit of their age towards slavery was hostility to the principle
and toleration only by necessity
but now it is to be transformed into a sacred right
henceforth it is to be the chief jewel of the nation
the very figure head of the ship of state
little by little
but steadily as man's march to the grave
we have been giving up the old for the new faith
near eighty years ago we began by declaring that all men are created equal but now from that beginning we have run down to the other declaration
that for some men to enslave others is a sacred right of self government
these principles cannot stand together
they are as opposite as god and mammon and whoever holds to the one must despise the other
our republican robe is soiled and trailed in the dust
let us purify it
let us turn and wash it white in the spirit if not the blood of the revolution
let us turn slavery from its claims of moral right
back upon its existing legal rights and its arguments of necessity
let us return it to the position our fathers gave it
and there let it rest in peace
let us re adopt the declaration of independence
and with it the practices and policy which harmonize with it
let north and south
let all americans
let all lovers of liberty everywhere
join in the great and good work
if we do this
we shall not only have saved the union
but we shall have so saved it as to make and to keep it for ever worthy of the saving

1855 my dear sir
you are not a friend of slavery in the abstract
in that speech you spoke of the peaceful extinction of slavery and used other expressions indicating your belief that the thing was
at some time
to have an end
since then we have had thirty six years of experience and this experience has demonstrated
i think
that there is no peaceful extinction of slavery in prospect for us
the signal failure of henry clay and other good and great men
in 1849
to effect anything in favour of gradual emancipation in kentucky
together with a thousand other signs
extinguishes that hope utterly
on the question of liberty
as a principle
we are not what we have been
when we were the political slaves of king george
and wanted to be free
we called the maxim that all men are created equal a self evident truth but now when we have grown fat
and have lost all dread of being slaves ourselves
we have become so greedy to be masters that we call the same maxim a self evident lie
the fourth of july has not quite dwindled away it is still a great day for burning fire crackers
that spirit which desired the peaceful extinction of slavery has itself become extinct with the occasion and the men of the revolution
under the impulse of that occasion
nearly half the states adopted systems of emancipation at once and it is a significant fact that not a single state has done the like since
so far as peaceful
voluntary emancipation is concerned
the condition of the negro slave in america
scarcely less terrible to the contemplation of the free mind
is now as fixed and hopeless of change for the better as that of the lost souls of the finally impenitent
the autocrat of all the russias will resign his crown and proclaim his subjects free republicans
sooner than will our american masters voluntarily give up their slaves
our political problem now is
can we as a nation continue together permanently for ever half slave
and half free
the problem is too mighty for me
may god in his mercy superintend the solution
your much obliged friend
and humble servant
extracts from letter to joshua f
august 24
1855 you suggest that in political action now
you and i would differ
i suppose we would not quite so much
as you may think
you know i dislike slavery
and you fully admit the abstract wrong of it
so far there is no cause of difference
but you say that sooner than yield your legal right to the slave
especially at the bidding of those who are not themselves interested
you would see the union dissolved
i am not aware that any one is bidding you yield that right very certainly i am not
i leave that matter entirely to yourself
i also acknowledge your rights and my obligations under the constitution in regard to your slaves
i confess i hate to see the poor creatures hunted down and caught and carried back to their stripes and unrequited toil but i bite my lips and keep quiet
in 1841
you and i had together a tedious low water trip on a steamboat
from louisville to st
you may remember
as i well do
that from louisville to the mouth of the ohio
there were on board ten or a dozen slaves shackled together with irons
that sight was a continued torment to me
and i see something like it every time i touch the ohio or any other slave border
it is not fair for you to assume that i have no interest in a thing which has
and continually exercises
the power of making me miserable
you ought rather to appreciate how much the great body of the northern people do crucify their feelings in order to maintain their loyalty to the constitution and the union
i do oppose the extension of slavery
because my judgment and feeling so prompt me
and i am under no obligations to the contrary
if for this you and i must differ
differ we must
you say if you were president
you would send an army and hang the leaders of the missouri outrages upon the kansas elections still
if kansas fairly votes herself a slave state she must be admitted
or the union must be dissolved
but how if she votes herself a slave state unfairly that is
by the very means for which you say you would hang men
must she still be admitted
or the union dissolved
that will be the phase of the question when it first becomes a practical one
in your assumption that there may be a fair decision of the slavery question in kansas
i plainly see that you and i would differ about the nebraska law
i look upon that enactment
not as a law
but as a violence from the beginning
it was conceived in violence
is maintained in violence
and is being executed in violence
i say it was conceived in violence
because the destruction of the missouri compromise
under the circumstances
was nothing less than violence
it was passed in violence
because it could not have passed at all but for the votes of many members in violence of the known will of their constituents
it is maintained in violence
because the elections since clearly demand its repeal
and the demand is openly disregarded
you say men ought to be hung for the way they are executing the law i say that the way it is being executed is quite as good as any of its antecedents
it is being executed in the precise way which was intended from the first
else why does no nebraska man express astonishment or condemnation
poor reeder is the only public man who has been silly enough to believe that anything like fairness was ever intended
and he has been bravely undeceived
that kansas will form a slave constitution
and with it ask to be admitted into the union
i take to be already a settled question
and so settled by the very means you so pointedly condemn
by every principle of law ever held by any court north or south
every negro taken to kansas is free yet in utter disregard of this in the spirit of violence merely that beautiful legislature gravely passes a law to hang any man who shall venture to inform a negro of his legal rights
this is the subject and real object of the law
like haman
they should hang upon the gallows of their own building
i shall not be among the mourners for their fate
in my humble sphere
i shall advocate the restoration of the missouri compromise so long as kansas remains a territory and when
by all these foul means
it seeks to come into the union as a slave state
i shall oppose it
i am very loath in any case to withhold my assent to the enjoyment of property acquired or located in good faith but i do not admit that good faith in taking a negro to kansas to be held in slavery is a probability with any man
any man who has sense enough to be the controller of his own property has too much sense to misunderstand the outrageous character of the whole nebraska business
but i digress
in my opposition to the admission of kansas
i shall have some company
but we may be beaten
if we are
i shall not
on that account
attempt to dissolve the union
i think it probable
we shall be beaten
standing as a unit among yourselves
you can
directly and indirectly
bribe enough of our men to carry the day
as you could on the open proposition to establish a monarchy
get hold of some man in the north whose position and ability are such that he can make the support of your measure
whatever it may be
a democratic party necessity
and the thing is done
apropos of this
let me tell you an anecdote
douglas introduced the nebraska bill in january
in february afterward
there was a called session of the illinois legislature
of the one hundred members composing the two branches of that body
about seventy were democrats
these latter held a caucus
in which the nebraska bill was talked of
if not formally discussed
it was thereby discovered that just three
and no more
were in favour of the measure
in a day or two douglas's orders came on to have resolutions passed approving the bill and they were passed by large majorities
the truth of this is vouched for by a bolting democratic member
the masses too
democratic as well as whig
were even nearer unanimous against it but as soon as the party necessity of supporting it became apparent
the way the democrats began to see the wisdom and justice of it was perfectly astonishing
you say that if kansas fairly votes herself a free state
as a christian you will rejoice at it
all decent slaveholders talk that way
and i do not doubt their candour but they never vote that way
although in a private letter or conversation you will express your preference that kansas should be free
you would vote for no man for congress who would say the same thing publicly
no such man could be elected from any district in a slave state
you think stringfellow and company ought to be hung
the slave breeders and slave traders are a small
and detested class among you and yet in politics they dictate the course of all of you
and are as completely your masters as you are the master of your own negroes
you inquire where i now stand
that is a disputed point
i think i am a whig but others say there are no whigs
and that i am an abolitionist
when i was at washington
i voted for the wilmot proviso as good as forty times and i never heard of any one attempting to unwhig me for that
i now do no more than oppose the extension of slavery
i am not a know nothing that is certain
how could i be
how can any one who abhors the oppression of negroes be in favour of degrading classes of white people
our progress in degeneracy appears to me to be pretty rapid
as a nation
we began by declaring that all men are created equal
we now practically read it
all men are created equal except negroes
when the know nothings get control
it will read
all men are created equal except negroes and foreigners and catholics
when it comes to this
i shall prefer emigrating to some country where they make no pretence of loving liberty to russia
for instance
where despotism can be taken pure
and without the base alloy of hypocrisy
my kindest regards to mrs
on the leading subject of this letter i have more of her sympathy than i have of yours and yet let me say i am your friend for ever
lincoln's speech
may 19
1856 mr
chairman and gentlemen
i was over at cries of platform
take the platform
i say
that while i was at danville court
some of our friends of anti nebraska got together in springfield and elected me as one delegate to represent old sangamon with them in this convention
and i am here certainly as a sympathizer in this movement and by virtue of that meeting and selection
but we can hardly be called delegates strictly
inasmuch as
properly speaking
we represent nobody but ourselves
i think it altogether fair to say that we have no anti nebraska party in sangamon
although there is a good deal of anti nebraska feeling there but i say for myself
and i think i may speak also for my colleagues
that we who are here fully approve of the platform and of all that has been done a voice
and even if we are not regularly delegates
it will be right for me to answer your call to speak
i suppose we truly stand for the public sentiment of sangamon on the great question of the repeal
although we do not yet represent many numbers who have taken a distinct position on the question
we are in a trying time it ranges above mere party and this movement to call a halt and turn our steps backward needs all the help and good counsels it can get for unless popular opinion makes itself very strongly felt
and a change is made in our present course
blood will flow on account of nebraska
and brother's hand will be raised against brother
the last sentence was uttered in such an earnest
if not
as to make a cold chill creep over me
others gave a similar experience
i have listened with great interest to the earnest appeal made to illinois men by the gentleman from lawrence james s
emery who has just addressed us so eloquently and forcibly
i was deeply moved by his statement of the wrongs done to free state men out there
i think it just to say that all true men north should sympathize with them
and ought to be willing to do any possible and needful thing to right their wrongs
but we must not promise what we ought not
lest we be called on to perform what we cannot we must be calm and moderate
and consider the whole difficulty
and determine what is possible and just
we must not be led by excitement and passion to do that which our sober judgments would not approve in our cooler moments
we have higher aims we will have more serious business than to dally with temporary measures
we are here to stand firmly for a principle to stand firmly for a right
we know that great political and moral wrongs are done
and outrages committed
and we denounce those wrongs and outrages
although we cannot
at present
do much more
but we desire to reach out beyond those personal outrages and establish a rule that will apply to all
and so prevent any future outrages
we have seen to day that every shade of popular opinion is represented here
with freedom or rather free soil as the basis
we have come together as in some sort representatives of popular opinion against the extension of slavery into territory now free in fact as well as by law
and the pledged word of the statesmen of the nation who are now no more
we come we are here assembled together to protest as well as we can against a great wrong
and to take measures
as well as we now can
to make that wrong right to place the nation
as far as it may be possible now
as it was before the repeal of the missouri compromise and the plain way to do this is to restore the compromise
and to demand and determine that kansas shall be free
immense applause
while we affirm
and reaffirm
if necessary
our devotion to the principles of the declaration of independence
let our practical work here be limited to the above
we know that there is not a perfect agreement of sentiment here on the public questions which might be rightfully considered in this convention
and that the indignation which we all must feel cannot be helped but all of us must give up something for the good of the cause
there is one desire which is uppermost in the mind
one wish common to us all to which no dissent will be made and i counsel you earnestly to bury all resentment
to sink all personal feeling
make all things work to a common purpose in which we are united and agreed about
and which all present will agree is absolutely necessary which must be done by any rightful mode if there be such
slavery must be kept out of kansas
the test the pinch is right there
if we lose kansas to freedom
an example will be set which will prove fatal to freedom in the end
in the language of the bible
must lay the axe to the root of the tree
temporizing will not do longer now is the time for decision for firm
resolute action
the nebraska bill
or rather nebraska law
is not one of wholesome legislation
but was and is an act of legislative usurpation
whose result
if not indeed intention
is to make slavery national and unless headed off in some effective way
we are in a fair way to see this land of boasted freedom converted into a land of slavery in fact
just open your two eyes
and see if this be not so
i need do no more than state
to command universal approval
that almost the entire north
as well as a large following in the border states
is radically opposed to the planting of slavery in free territory
probably in a popular vote throughout the nation nine tenths of the voters in the free states
and at least one half in the border states
if they could express their sentiments freely
would vote no on such an issue and it is safe to say that two thirds of the votes of the entire nation would be opposed to it
and yet
in spite of this overbalancing of sentiment in this free country
we are in a fair way to see kansas present itself for admission as a slave state
it is a felony
by the local law of kansas
to deny that slavery exists there even now
by every principle of law
a negro in kansas is free yet the bogus legislature makes it an infamous crime to tell him that he is free
the party lash and the fear of ridicule will overawe justice and liberty for it is a singular fact
but none the less a fact
and well known by the most common experience
that men will do things under the terror of the party lash that they would not on any account or for any consideration do otherwise while men who will march up to the mouth of a loaded cannon without shrinking
will run from the terrible name of abolitionist
even when pronounced by a worthless creature whom they
with good reason
for instance to press this point a little judge douglas introduced his anti nebraska bill in january and we had an extra session of our legislature in the succeeding february
in which were seventy five democrats and at a party caucus
fully attended
there were just three votes out of the whole seventy five
for the measure
but in a few days orders came on from washington
commanding them to approve the measure the party lash was applied
and it was brought up again in caucus
and passed by a large majority
the masses were against it
but party necessity carried it and it was passed through the lower house of congress against the will of the people
for the same reason
here is where the greatest danger lies that
while we profess to be a government of law and reason
law will give way to violence on demand of this awful and crushing power
like the great juggernaut i think that is the name the great idol
it crushes everything that comes in its way
and makes a or as i read once
in a black letter law book
a slave is a human being who is legally not a person
but a thing
and if the safeguards to liberty are broken down
as is now attempted
when they have made things of all the free negroes
how long
think you
before they will begin to make things of poor white men
be not deceived
revolutions do not go backward
the founder of the democratic party declared that all men were created equal
his successor in the leadership has written the word white before men
making it read all white men are created equal
pray
will or may not the know nothings
if they should get in power
add the word protestant
making it read all protestant white men
meanwhile the hapless negro is the fruitful subject of reprisals in other quarters
john pettit
whom tom benton paid his respects to
you will recollect
calls the immortal declaration a self evident lie while at the birth place of freedom in the shadow of bunker hill and of the cradle of liberty
at the home of the adamses and warren and otis choate
from our side of the house
dares to fritter away the birthday promise of liberty by proclaiming the declaration to be a string of glittering generalities and the southern whigs
working hand in hand with pro slavery democrats
are making choate's theories practical
thomas jefferson
a slaveholder
mindful of the moral element in slavery
solemnly declared that he trembled for his country when he remembered that god is just while judge douglas
with an insignificant wave of the hand
don't care whether slavery is voted up or voted down
now
if slavery is right
or even negative
he has a right to treat it in this trifling manner
but if it is a moral and political wrong
as all christendom considers it to be
how can he answer to god for this attempt to spread and fortify it
but no man
and judge douglas no more than any other
can maintain a negative
or merely neutral
position on this question and
he avows that the union was made by white men and for white men and their descendants
as matter of fact
the first branch of the proposition is historically true the government was made by white men
and they were and are the superior race
this i admit
but the corner stone of the government
so to speak
was the declaration that all men are created equal
and all entitled to life
and the pursuit of happiness
applause
and not only so
but the framers of the constitution were particular to keep out of that instrument the word slave
the reason being that slavery would ultimately come to an end
and they did not wish to have any reminder that in this free country human beings were ever prostituted to slavery
nor is it any argument that we are superior and the negro inferior that he has but one talent while we have ten
let the negro possess the little he has in independence if he has but one talent
he should be permitted to keep the little he has
but slavery will endure no test of reason or logic and yet its advocates
like douglas
use a sort of bastard logic
or noisy assumption
it might better be termed
like the above
in order to prepare the mind for the gradual
but none the less certain
encroachments of the moloch of slavery upon
the fair domain of freedom
but however much you may argue upon it
or smother it in soft phrases
slavery can only be maintained by force by violence
the repeal of the missouri compromise was by violence
it was a violation of both law and the sacred obligations of honour
to overthrow and trample underfoot a solemn compromise
obtained by the fearful loss to freedom of one of the fairest of our western domains
congress violated the will and confidence of its constituents in voting for the bill and while public sentiment
as shown by the elections of 1854
demanded the restoration of this compromise
congress violated its trust by refusing
simply because it had the force of numbers to hold on to it
and murderous violence is being used now
in order to force slavery on to kansas for it cannot be done in any other way
the necessary result was to establish the rule of violence force
instead of the rule of law and reason to perpetuate and spread slavery
in time
to make it general
we see it at both ends of the line
in washington
on the very spot where the outrage was started
the fearless sumner is beaten to insensibility
and is now slowly dying while senators who claim to be gentlemen and christians stood by
countenancing the act
and even applauding it afterward in their places in the senate
even douglas
our man
saw it all and was within helping distance
yet let the murderous blows fall unopposed
at the other end of the line
at the very time sumner was being murdered
lawrence was being destroyed for the crime of freedom
it was the most prominent stronghold of liberty in kansas
and must give way to the all dominating power of slavery
only two days ago
judge trumbull found it necessary to propose a bill in the senate to prevent a general civil war and to restore peace in kansas
we live in the midst of alarms anxiety beclouds the future we expect some new disaster with each newspaper we read
are we in a healthful political state
are not the tendencies plain
do not the signs of the times point plainly the way in which we are going
in the early days of the constitution slavery was recognized
by south and north alike
as an evil
and the division of sentiment about it was not controlled by geographical lines or considerations of climate
but by moral and philanthropic views
petitions for the abolition of slavery were presented to the very first congress by virginia and massachusetts alike
to show the harmony which prevailed
i will state that a fugitive slave law was passed in 1793
with no dissenting voice in the senate
and but seven dissenting votes in the house
it was
a wise law
under the constitution
a just one
twenty five years later
a more stringent law was proposed and defeated and thirty five years after that
the present law
drafted by mason of virginia
was passed by northern votes
i am not
just now
complaining of this law
but i am trying to show how the current sets for the proposed law of 1817 was far less offensive than the present one
in 1774 the continental congress pledged itself
without a dissenting vote
to wholly discontinue the slave trade
and to neither purchase nor import any slave
and less than three months before the passage of the declaration of independence
the same congress which adopted that declaration unanimously resolved that no slave be imported into any of the thirteen united colonies
great applause
on the second day of july
the draft of a declaration of independence was reported to congress by the committee
and in it the slave trade was characterized as an execrable commerce
as a piratical warfare
as the opprobrium of infidel powers
and as a cruel war against human nature
applause
all agreed on this except south carolina and georgia
and in order to preserve harmony
and from the necessity of the case
these expressions were omitted
abolition societies existed as far south as virginia and it is a well known fact that washington
and pendleton were qualified abolitionists
and much more radical on that subject than we of the whig and democratic parties claim to be to day
on march 1
virginia ceded to the confederation all its lands lying northwest of the ohio river
chase of maryland
and howell of rhode island
as a committee on that and territory thereafter to be ceded
reported that no slavery should exist after the year 1800
had this report been adopted
not only the northwest
but kentucky
and mississippi also would have been free but it required the assent of nine states to ratify it
north carolina was divided
and thus its vote was lost and delaware
and new jersey refused to vote
in point of fact
as it was
it was assented to by six states
three years later
on a square vote to exclude slavery from the northwest
only one vote
and that from new york
was against it
and yet
thirty seven years later
five thousand citizens of illinois out of a voting mass of less than twelve thousand
after a long and heated contest
voted to introduce slavery in illinois and
a large party in the free state of illinois are willing to vote to fasten the shackles of slavery on the fair domain of kansas
notwithstanding it received the dowry of freedom long before its birth as a political community
i repeat
the question
is it not plain in what direction we are tending
in the colonial time
and jefferson were as hostile to slavery in virginia as otis
and the adamses were in massachusetts and virginia made as earnest an effort to get rid of it as old massachusetts did
but circumstances were against them and they failed but not that the good will of its leading men was lacking
yet within less than fifty years virginia changed its tune
and made negro breeding for the cotton and sugar states one of its leading industries
laughter and applause
in the constitutional convention
george mason of virginia made a more violent abolition speech than my friends lovejoy or codding would desire to make here to day a speech which could not be safely repeated anywhere on southern soil in this enlightened year
but while there were some differences of opinion on this subject even then
discussion was allowed but as you see by the kansas slave code
as you know
is the missouri slave code
merely ferried across the river
it is a felony to even express an opinion hostile to that foul blot in the land of washington and the declaration of independence
in kentucky my state in 1849
on a test vote
the mighty influence of henry clay and many other good men there could not get a symptom of expression in favour of gradual emancipation on a plain issue of marching toward the light of civilization with ohio and illinois but the state of boone and hardin and henry clay
with a nigger under each arm
took the black trail toward the deadly swamps of barbarism
is there can there be any doubt about this thing
and is there any doubt that we must all lay aside our prejudices and march
shoulder to shoulder
in the great army of freedom
every fourth of july our young orators all proclaim this to be the land of the free and the home of the brave
well
when you orators get that off next year
may be
this very year
how would you like some old grizzled farmer to get up in the grove and deny it
how would you like that
but suppose kansas comes in as a slave state
and all the border ruffians have barbecues about it
and free state men come trailing back to the dishonoured north
like whipped dogs with their tails between their legs
it is ain't it
evident that this is no more the land of the free and if we let it go so
we won't dare to say home of the brave out loud
sensation and confusion
can any man doubt that
even in spite of the people's will
slavery will triumph through violence
unless that will be made manifest and enforced
even governor reeder claimed at the outset that the contest in kansas was to be fair
but he got his eyes open at last and i believe that
as a result of this moral and physical violence
kansas will soon apply for admission as a slave state
and yet we can't mistake that the people don't want it so
and that it is a land which is free both by natural and political law
no law is free law
such is the understanding of all christendom
in the somerset case
decided nearly a century ago
the great lord mansfield held that slavery was of such a nature that it must take its rise in positive as distinguished from natural law and that in no country or age could it be traced back to any other source
will some one please tell me where is the positive law that establishes slavery in kansas
a voice
the bogus laws
aye
the bogus laws
on the same principle
a gang of missouri horse thieves could come into illinois and declare horse stealing to be legal laughter
and it would be just as legal as slavery is in kansas
but by express statute
in the land of washington and jefferson
we may soon be brought face to face with the discreditable fact of showing to the world by our acts that we prefer slavery to freedom darkness to light
it is
i believe
a principle in law that when one party to a contract violates it so grossly as to chiefly destroy the object for which it is made
the other party may rescind it
i will ask browning if that ain't good law
well
now if that be right
i go for rescinding the whole
entire missouri compromise and thus turning missouri into a free state and i should like to know the difference should like for any one to point out the difference between our making a free state of missouri and their making a slave state of kansas
great applause
there ain't one bit of difference
except that our way would be a great mercy to humanity
but i have never said and the whig party has never said and those who oppose the nebraska bill do not as a body say
that they have any intention of interfering with slavery in the slave states
our platform says just the contrary
we allow slavery to exist in the slave states not because slavery is right or good
but from the necessities of our union
we grant a fugitive slave law because it is so nominated in the bond because our fathers so stipulated had to and we are bound to carry out this agreement
but they did not agree to introduce slavery in regions where it did not previously exist
on the contrary
they said by their example and teachings that they did not deem it expedient did not consider it right to do so and it is wise and right to do just as they did about it voices
and that is what we propose not to interfere with slavery where it exists we have never tried to do it
and to give them a reasonable and efficient fugitive slave law
a voice
i say yes
it was part of the bargain
and i'm for living up to it but i go no further i'm not bound to do more
and i won't agree any further
great applause
we
here in illinois
should feel especially proud of the provision of the missouri compromise excluding slavery from what is now kansas for an illinois man
jesse b
was its father
henry clay
who is credited with the authorship of the compromise in general terms
did not even vote for that provision
but only advocated the ultimate admission by a second compromise and
thomas was
beyond all controversy
the real author of the slavery restriction branch of the compromise
to show the generosity of the northern members toward the southern side on a test vote to exclude slavery from missouri
ninety voted not to exclude
and eighty seven to exclude
every vote from the slave states being ranged with the former and fourteen votes from the free states
of whom seven were from new england alone while on a vote to exclude slavery from what is now kansas
the vote was one hundred and thirty four for to forty two against
the scheme
as a whole
of course
a southern triumph
it is idle to contend otherwise
as is now being done by the nebraskaites it was so shown by the votes and quite as emphatically by the expressions of representative men
lowndes of south carolina was never known to commit a political mistake his was the great judgment of that section and he declared that this measure would restore tranquillity to the country a result demanded by every consideration of discretion
of moderation
of wisdom
and of virtue
when the measure came before president monroe for his approval
he put to each member of his cabinet this question
has congress the constitutional power to prohibit slavery in a territory
and john c
calhoun and william h
crawford from the south
equally with john quincy adams
benjamin rush
and smith thompson from the north
alike answered
without qualification or equivocation and this measure
of so great consequence to the south
was passed and missouri was
by means of it
finally enabled to knock at the door of the republic for an open passage to its brood of slaves
in spite of this
freedom's share is about to be taken by violence by the force of misrepresentative votes
not called for by the popular will
what name can i
in common decency
give to this wicked transaction
but even then the contest was not over for when the missouri constitution came before congress for its approval
it forbade any free negro or mulatto from entering the state
in short
our illinois black laws were hidden away in their constitution laughter
and the controversy was thus revived
then it was that mr
clay's talents shone out conspicuously
and the controversy that shook the union to its foundation was finally settled to the satisfaction of the conservative parties on both sides of the line
though not to the extremists on either
and missouri was admitted by the small majority of six in the lower house
how great a majority
do you think
would have been given had kansas also been secured for slavery
a voice
a majority the other way
a majority the other way
is answered
do you think it would have been safe for a northern man to have confronted his constituents after having voted to consign both missouri and kansas to hopeless slavery
and yet this man douglas
who misrepresents his constituents
and who has exerted his highest talents in that direction
will be carried in triumph through the state
and hailed with honour while applauding that act
three groans for dug
and this shows whither we are tending
this thing of slavery is more powerful than its supporters even than the high priests that minister at its altar
it debauches even our greatest men
it gathers strength
like a rolling snow ball
by its own infamy
monstrous crimes are committed in its name by persons collectively which they would not dare to commit as individuals
its aggressions and encroachments almost surpass belief
in a despotism
one might not wonder to see slavery advance steadily and remorselessly into new dominions but is it not wonderful
is it not even alarming
to see its steady advance in a land dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal
it yields nothing itself it keeps all it has
and gets all it can besides
it really came dangerously near securing illinois in 1824 it did get missouri in 1821
the first proposition was to admit what is now arkansas and missouri as one slave state
but the territory was divided
and arkansas came in
without serious question
as a slave state and afterward missouri
not as a sort of equality
but also as a slave state
then we had florida and texas and now kansas is about to be forced into the dismal procession
and so it is wherever you look
we have not forgotten it is but six years since how dangerously near california came to being a slave state
texas is a slave state
and four other slave states may be carved from its vast domain
and yet
in the year 1829
slavery was abolished throughout that vast region by a royal decree of the then sovereign of mexico
will you please tell me by what right slavery exists in texas to day
by the same right as
and no higher or greater than
slavery is seeking dominion in kansas
by political force peaceful
if that will suffice by the torch as in kansas and the bludgeon as in the senate chamber
if required
and so history repeats itself and even as slavery has kept its course by craft
and violence in the past
so it will persist
in my judgment
until met and dominated by the will of a people bent on its restriction
we have
this very afternoon
heard bitter denunciations of brooks in washington
and titus
and shannon in kansas the battle ground of slavery
i certainly am not going to advocate or shield them but they and their acts are but the necessary outcome of the nebraska law
we should reserve our highest censure for the authors of the mischief
and not for the catspaws which they use
i believe it was shakespeare who said
where the offence lies
there let the axe fall and
in my opinion
this man douglas and the northern men in congress who advocate nebraska are more guilty than a thousand joneses and stringfellows
with all their murderous practices
can be
we have made a good beginning here to day
as our methodist friends would say
i feel it is good to be here
while extremists may find some fault with the moderation of our platform
they should recollect that the battle is not always to the strong
nor the race to the swift
in grave emergencies
moderation is generally safer than radicalism
and as this struggle is likely to be long and earnest
we must not
by our action
repel any who are in sympathy with us in the main
but rather win all that we can to our standard
we must not belittle nor overlook the facts of our condition that we are new and comparatively weak
while our enemies are entrenched and relatively strong
they have the administration and the political power and
right or wrong
at present they have the numbers
our friends who urge an appeal to arms with so much force and eloquence
should recollect that the government is arrayed against us
and that the numbers are now arrayed against us as well or
to state it nearer to the truth
they are not yet expressly and affirmatively for us and we should repel friends rather than gain them by anything savouring of revolutionary methods
as it now stands
we must appeal to the sober sense and patriotism of the people
we will make converts day by day we will grow strong by calmness and moderation we will grow strong by the violence and injustice of our adversaries
unless truth be a mockery and justice a hollow lie
we will be in the majority after a while
and then the revolution which we will accomplish will be none the less radical from being the result of pacific measures
the battle of freedom is to be fought out on principle
slavery is a violation of the eternal right
we have temporized with it from the necessities of our condition but as sure as god reigns and school children read
that black foul lie can never be consecrated into god's hallowed truth
immense applause lasting some time
one of our greatest difficulties is
that men who know that slavery is a detestable crime and ruinous to the nation
are compelled
by our peculiar condition and other circumstances
to advocate it concretely
though damning it in the raw
henry clay was a brilliant example of this tendency others of our purest statesmen are compelled to do so and thus slavery secures actual support from those who detest it at heart
yet henry clay perfected and forced through the compromise which secured to slavery a great state as well as a political advantage
not that he hated slavery less
but that he loved the whole union more
as long as slavery profited by his great compromise
the hosts of pro slavery could not sufficiently cover him with praise but now that this compromise stands in their way
they never mention him
his name is never heard
their lips are now forbid to speak that once familiar word
they have slaughtered one of his most cherished measures
and his ghost would arise to rebuke them
great applause
now
let us harmonize
my friends
and appeal to the moderation and patriotism of the people
to the sober second thought to the awakened public conscience
the repeal of the sacred missouri compromise has installed the weapons of violence
the bludgeon
the incendiary torch
the death dealing rifle
the bristling cannon the weapons of kingcraft
of the inquisition
of ignorance
of barbarism
of oppression
we see its fruits in the dying bed of the heroic sumner in the ruins of the free state hotel in the smoking embers of the herald of freedom in the free state governor of kansas chained to a stake on freedom's soil like a horse thief
for the crime of freedom
we see it in christian statesmen
and christian newspapers
and christian pulpits
applauding the cowardly act of a low bully
who crawled upon his victim behind his back and dealt the deadly blow
sensation and applause
we note our political demoralization in the catch words that are coming into such common use on the one hand
and sometimes freedom screechers laughter and
on the other hand
border ruffians
and that fully deserved
and the significance of catch words cannot pass unheeded
for they constitute a sign of the times
everything in this world jibes in with everything else
and all the fruits of this nebraska bill are like the poisoned source from which they come
i will not say that we may not sooner or later be compelled to meet force by force but the time has not yet come
and if we are true to ourselves
may never come
do not mistake that the ballot is stronger than the bullet
therefore let the legions of slavery use bullets but let us wait patiently till november
and fire ballots at them in return and by that peaceful policy
i believe we shall ultimately win
it was by that policy that here in illinois the early fathers fought the good fight and gained the victory
in 1824 the free men of our state
led by governor coles who was a native of maryland and president madison's private secretary
determined that those beautiful groves should never re echo the dirge of one who has no title to himself
by their resolute determination
the winds that sweep across our broad prairies shall never cool the parched brow
nor shall the unfettered streams that bring joy and gladness to our free soil water the tired feet
of a slave but so long as those heavenly breezes and sparkling streams bless the land
or the groves and their fragrance or their memory remain
the humanity to which they minister shall be for ever free
great applause
palmer
and some more in this convention came from kentucky to illinois instead of going to missouri
not only to better their conditions
but also to get away from slavery
they have said so to me
and it is understood among us kentuckians that we don't like it one bit
can we
mindful of the blessings of liberty which the early men of illinois left to us
refuse a like privilege to the free men who seek to plant freedom's banner on our western outposts
should we not stand by our neighbours who seek to better their conditions in kansas and nebraska
can we as christian men
and strong and free ourselves
wield the sledge or hold the iron which is to manacle anew an already oppressed race
woe unto them
it is written
that decree unrighteous decrees and that write grievousness which they have prescribed
can we afford to sin any more deeply against human liberty
one great trouble in the matter is
that slavery is an insidious and crafty power
and gains equally by open violence of the brutal as well as by sly management of the peaceful
even after the ordinance of 1787
the settlers in indiana and illinois it was all one government then tried to get congress to allow slavery temporarily
and petitions to that end were sent from kaskaskia
and general harrison
the governor
urged it from vincennes the capital
if that had succeeded
good bye to liberty here
but john randolph of virginia made a vigorous report against it and although they persevered so well as to get three favourable reports for it
yet the united states senate
with the aid of some slave states
finally squelched it for good
and that is why this hall is to day a temple for free men instead of a negro livery stable
great applause and laughter
once let slavery get planted in a locality
by ever so weak or doubtful a title
and in ever so small numbers
and it is like the canada thistle or bermuda grass you can't root it out
you yourself may detest slavery but your neighbour has five or six slaves
and he is an excellent neighbour
or your son has married his daughter
and they beg you to help save their property
and you vote against your interest and principles to accommodate a neighbour
hoping that your vote will be on the losing side
and others do the same and in those ways slavery gets a sure foothold
and when that is done the whole mighty union the force of the nation is committed to its support
and that very process is working in kansas to day
and you must recollect that the slave property is worth a billion of dollars 1
000 while free state men must work for sentiment alone
then there are blue lodges as they call them everywhere doing their secret and deadly work
it is a very strange thing
and not solvable by any moral law that i know of
that if a man loses his horse
the whole country will turn out to help hang the thief but if a man but a shade or two darker than i am is himself stolen
the same crowd will hang one who aids in restoring him to liberty
such are the inconsistencies of slavery
where a horse is more sacred than a man and the essence of squatter or popular sovereignty i don't care how you call it is that if one man chooses to make a slave of another
no third man shall be allowed to object
and if you can do this in free kansas
and it is allowed to stand
the next thing you will see is ship loads of negroes from africa at the wharf at charleston for one thing is as truly lawful as the other and these are the bastard notions we have got to stamp out
else they will stamp us out
sensation and applause
two years ago
at springfield
judge douglas avowed that illinois came into the union as a slave state
and that slavery was weeded out by the operation of his great
everlasting principle of popular sovereignty
laughter
well
that argument must be answered
for it has a little grain of truth at the bottom
i do not mean that it is true in essence
as he would have us believe
it could not be essentially true if the ordinance of '87 was valid
in point of fact
there were some degraded beings called slaves in kaskaskia and the other french settlements when our first state constitution was adopted that is a fact
and i don't deny it
slaves were brought here as early as 1720
and were kept here in spite of the ordinance of 1787 against it
but slavery did not thrive here
on the contrary
under the influence of the ordinance
the number decreased fifty one from 1810 to 1820 while under the influence of squatter sovereignty
right across the river in missouri
they increased seven thousand two hundred and eleven in the same time and slavery finally faded out in illinois
under the influence of the law of freedom
while it grew stronger and stronger in missouri
under the law or practice of popular sovereignty
in point of fact there were but one hundred and seventeen slaves in illinois one year after its admission
or one to every four hundred and seventy of its population or
to state it in another way
if illinois was a slave state in 1820
so were new york and new jersey much greater slave states from having had greater numbers
slavery having been established there in very early times
but there is this vital difference between all these states and the judge's kansas experiment
that they sought to disestablish slavery which had been already established
while the judge seeks
so far as he can
to disestablish freedom
which had been established there by the missouri compromise
the union is undergoing a fearful strain but it is a stout old ship
and has weathered many a hard blow
and the stars in their courses
aye
an invisible power
greater than the puny efforts of men
will fight for us
but we ourselves must not decline the burden of responsibility
nor take counsel of unworthy passions
whatever duty urges us to do or to omit
must be done or omitted and the recklessness with which our adversaries break the laws
or counsel their violation
should afford no example for us
let us revere the declaration of independence let us continue to obey the constitution and the laws let us keep step to the music of the union
let us draw a cordon
so to speak
around the slave states
and the hateful institution
like a reptile poisoning itself
will perish by its own infamy
but we cannot be free men if this is
by our national choice
to be a land of slavery
those who deny freedom to others
deserve it not for themselves and
under the rule of a just god
cannot long retain it
loud applause
did you ever
my friends
seriously reflect upon the speed with which we are tending downward
within the memory of men now present the leading statesmen of virginia could make genuine
red hot abolitionist speeches in old virginia and
as i have said
now even in free kansas it is a crime to declare that it is free kansas
the very sentiments that i and others have just uttered would entitle us
and each of us
to the ignominy and seclusion of a dungeon and yet i suppose that
like paul
we were free born
but if this thing is allowed to continue
it will be but one step further to impress the same rule in illinois
the conclusion of all is
that we must restore the missouri compromise
we must highly resolve that kansas must be free
great applause
we must reinstate the birthday promise of the republic we must reaffirm the declaration of independence we must make good in essence as well as in form madison's vowal that the word slave ought not to appear in the constitution and we must even go further
and decree that only local law
and not that time honoured instrument
shall shelter a slave holder
we must make this a land of liberty in fact
as it is in name
but in seeking to attain these results so indispensable if the liberty which is our pride and boast shall endure we will be loyal to the constitution and to the flag of our union
and no matter what our grievance even though kansas shall come in as a slave state and no matter what theirs even if we shall restore the compromise we will say to the southern disunionists
we won't go out of the union
and you shan't
this was the climax the audience rose to its feet en masse
waved handkerchiefs
threw hats in the air
and ran riot for several minutes
the arch enchanter who wrought this transformation looked
like the personification of political justice
but let us
appeal to the sense and patriotism of the people
and not to their prejudices let us spread the floods of enthusiasm here aroused all over these vast prairies
so suggestive of freedom
let us commence by electing the gallant soldier governor colonel bissell who stood for the honour of our state alike on the plains and amidst the chaparral of mexico and on the floor of congress
while he defied the southern hotspur and that will have a greater moral effect than all the border ruffians can accomplish in all their raids on kansas
there is both a power and a magic in popular opinion
to that let us now appeal and while
in all probability
no resort to force will be needed
our moderation and forbearance will stand us in good stead when
if ever
we must make an appeal to battle and to the god of hosts
immense applause and a rush for the orator
this speech has been called lincoln's lost speech
because all the reporters present were so carried away by his eloquence that they one and all forgot to take any notes
if it had not been for a young lawyer
a mr
who kept his head sufficiently to take notes
we would have no record of it
whitney wrote out the speech for mcclure's magazine in 1896
it was submitted to several people who were present at the bloomington convention
and they said it was remarkably accurate considering that it was not taken down stenographically
from his speech on the dred scott decision
june 26
and now as to the dred scott decision
that decision declares two propositions
that a negro cannot sue in the united states courts and secondly
that congress cannot prohibit slavery in the territories
it was made by a divided court
dividing differently on the different points
judge douglas does not discuss the merits of the decision
and in that respect i shall follow his example
believing i could no more improve on mclean and curtis than he could on taney
he denounces all who question the correctness of that decision
as offering violent resistance to it
but who resists it
who has
in spite of the decision
declared dred scott free
and resisted the authority of his master over him
judicial decisions have two uses
to absolutely determine the case decided and secondly
to indicate to the public how other similar cases will be decided when they arise
for the latter use
they are called precedents and authorities
we believe as much as judge douglas perhaps more in obedience to and respect for the judicial department of government
we think its decisions on constitutional questions
when fully settled
should control not only the particular cases decided
but the general policy of the country
subject to be disturbed only by amendments of the constitution
as provided in that instrument itself
more than this would be revolution
but we think the dred scott decision is erroneous
we know the court that made it has often overruled its own decisions
and we shall do what we can to have it overrule this
we offer no resistance to it
judicial decisions are of greater or less authority as precedents according to circumstances
that this should be so
accords both with common sense and the customary understanding of the legal profession
if this important decision had been made by the unanimous concurrence of the judges
and without any apparent partisan bias
and in accordance with legal public expectation
and with the steady practice of the departments throughout our history
and had been in no part based on assumed historical facts
which are not really true or if wanting in some of these
it had been before the court more than once
and had there been affirmed and reaffirmed through a course of years
it then might be
perhaps would be factious
even revolutionary
not to acquiesce in it as a precedent
but when
as is true
we find it wanting in all these claims to the public confidence
it is not resistance
it is not factious
it is not even disrespectful to treat it as not having yet quite established a settled doctrine for the country
i have said in substance
that the dred scott decision was in part based on assumed historical facts which were not really true
and i ought not to leave the subject without giving some reasons for saying this
i therefore give an instance or two
which i think fully sustain me
chief justice taney
in delivering the opinion of the majority of the court
insists at great length that negroes were no part of the people who made
or for whom was made
the declaration of independence
or the constitution of the united states
on the contrary
judge curtis
in his dissenting opinion
shows that in five of the then thirteen states to wit
new hampshire
new york
new jersey
and north carolina free negroes were voters
and in proportion to their numbers had the same part in making the constitution that the white people had
he shows this with so much particularity as to leave no doubt of its truth and as a sort of conclusion on that point
holds the following language
the constitution was ordained and established by the people of the united states
through the action
in each state
of those persons who were qualified by its laws to act thereon in behalf of themselves and all other citizens of the state
in some of the states
as we have seen
coloured persons were among those qualified by law to act on the subject
these coloured persons were not only included in the body of 'the people of the united states' by whom the constitution was ordained and established but in at least five of the states they had the power to act
and doubtless did act
by their suffrages
upon the question of its adoption
again
chief justice taney says
it is difficult at this day to realize the state of public opinion
in relation to that unfortunate race
which prevailed in the civilized and enlightened portions of the world at the time of the declaration of independence
and when the constitution of the united states was framed and adopted
and again
after quoting from the declaration
he says
the general words above quoted would seem to include the whole human family
and if they were used in a similar instrument at this day
would be so understood
in these the chief justice does not directly assert
but plainly assumes as a fact
that the public estimate of the black man is more favourable now than it was in the days of the revolution
this assumption is a mistake
in some trifling particulars the condition of that race has been ameliorated but as a whole
in this country
the change between then and now is decidedly the other way and their ultimate destiny has never appeared so hopeless as in the last three or four years
in two of the five states new jersey and north carolina that then gave the free negro the right of voting
the right has since been taken away and in a third new york it has been greatly abridged
while it has not been extended
so far as i know
to a single additional state
though the number of the states has more than doubled
in those days
as i understand
masters could
at their own pleasure
emancipate their slaves but since then such legal restraints have been made upon emancipation as to amount almost to prohibition
in those days legislatures held the unquestioned power to abolish slavery in their respective states but now it is becoming quite fashionable for state constitutions to withhold that power from the legislatures
in those days
by common consent
the spread of the black man's bondage to the new countries was prohibited but now congress decides that it will not continue the prohibition
and the supreme court decides that it could not if it would
in those days our declaration of independence was held sacred by all
and thought to include all but now
to aid in making the bondage of the negro universal and eternal
it is assailed and sneered at
and construed
and hawked at
and torn
if its framers could rise from their graves
they could not at all recognize it
all the powers of earth seem rapidly combining against him
mammon is after him ambition follows
philosophy follows
and the theology of the day is fast joining in the cry
they have him in his prison house they have searched his person
and left no prying instrument with him
one after another they have closed the heavy iron doors upon him and now they have him
as it were
bolted in with a lock of a hundred keys
which can never be unlocked without the concurrence of every key the keys in the hands of a hundred different men
and they scattered to a hundred different and distant places and they stand musing as to what invention
in all the dominions of mind and matter
can be produced to make the impossibility of escape more complete than it is
it is grossly incorrect to say or assume that the public estimate of the negro is more favourable now than it was at the origin of the government
there is a natural disgust in the minds of nearly all white people at the idea of an indiscriminate amalgamation of the white and black races and judge douglas evidently is basing his chief hope upon the chances of his being able to appropriate the benefit of this disgust to himself
if he can
by much drumming and repeating
fasten the odium of that idea upon his adversaries
he thinks he can struggle through the storm
he therefore clings to this hope as a drowning man to the last plank
he makes an occasion for lugging it in from the opposition to the dred scott decision
he finds the republicans insisting that the declaration of independence includes all men
black as well as white and forthwith he boldly denies that it includes negroes at all
and proceeds to argue gravely that all who contend it does
do so only because they want to vote
and eat
and sleep
and marry with negroes
he will have it that they cannot be consistent else
now i protest against the counterfeit logic which concludes that because i do not want a black woman for a slave
i must necessarily want her for a wife
i need not have her for either
i can just leave her alone
in some respects she certainly is not my equal but in her natural right to eat the bread she earns with her own hands without asking leave of any one else
she is my equal
and the equal of all others
chief justice taney
in his opinion in the dred scott case
admits that the language of the declaration is broad enough to include the whole human family but he and judge douglas argue that the authors of that instrument did not intend to include negroes
by the fact that they did not at once actually place them on an equality with the whites
now this grave argument comes to just nothing at all
by the other fact that they did not at once
nor ever afterward
actually place all white people on an equality with one another
and this is the staple argument of both the chief justice and the senator
for doing this obvious violence to the plain
unmistakable language of the declaration
i think the authors of that notable instrument intended to include all men
but they did not intend to declare all men equal in all respects
they did not mean to say that all were equal in colour
moral developments
or social capacity
they defined with tolerable distinctness in what respects they did consider all men created equal
equal with certain inalienable rights
among which are life
and the pursuit of happiness
this they said
and this they meant
they did not mean to assert the obvious untruth that all were then actually enjoying that equality
nor yet that they were about to confer it immediately upon them
in fact
they had no power to confer such a boon
they meant simply to declare the right
so that the enforcement of it might follow as fast as circumstances should permit
they meant to set up a standard maxim for free society
which should be familiar to all and revered by all
constantly looked to
constantly laboured for
even though never perfectly attained
constantly approximated
and thereby constantly spreading and deepening its influence
and augmenting the happiness and value of life to all people of all colours everywhere
the assertion that all men are created equal
was of no practical use in effecting our separation from great britain and it was placed in the declaration
not for that
but for future use
its authors meant it to be as
thank god
it is now proving itself
a stumbling block to all those who in after times might seek to turn a free people back into the hateful paths of despotism
they knew the proneness of prosperity to breed tyrants
and they meant
when such should reappear in this fair land and commence their vocation
that they should find left for them at least one hard nut to crack
i have now briefly expressed my view of the meaning and object of that part of the declaration of independence which declares that all men are created equal
now let us hear judge douglas's view of the same subject
as i find it in the printed report of his late speech
here it is
no man can vindicate the character
motives and conduct of the signers of the declaration of independence except upon the hypothesis that they referred to the white race alone
and not to the african
when they declared all men to have been created equal that they were speaking of british subjects on this continent being equal to british subjects born and residing in great britain that they were entitled to the same inalienable rights
and among them were enumerated life
and the pursuit of happiness
the declaration was adopted for the purpose of justifying the colonists in the eyes of the civilized world in withdrawing their allegiance from the british crown
and dissolving their connection with the mother country
my good friends
read that carefully over some leisure hour
and ponder well upon it see what a mere wreck and mangled ruin judge douglas makes of our once glorious declaration
he says they were speaking of british subjects on this continent being equal to british subjects born and residing in great britain
why
according to this
not only negroes but white people outside of great britain and america were not spoken of in that instrument
the english
and scotch
along with white americans
were included
to be sure but the french
and other white people of the world are all gone to pot along with the judge's inferior races
i had thought that the declaration promised something better than the condition of british subjects but no
it only meant that we should be equal to them in their own oppressed and unequal condition
according to that
it gave no promise that
having kicked off the king and lords of great britain
we should not at once be saddled with a king and lords of our own
i had thought the declaration contemplated the progressive improvement in the condition of all men
everywhere but no
it merely was adopted for the purpose of justifying the colonists in the eyes of the civilized world in withdrawing their allegiance from the british crown
and dissolving their connection with the mother country
why
that object having been effected some eighty years ago
the declaration is of no practical use now mere rubbish old wadding
left to rot on the battle field after the victory is won
i understand you are preparing to celebrate the fourth
to morrow week
what for
the doings of that day had no reference to the present and quite half of you are not even descendants of those who were referred to at that day
but i suppose you will celebrate
and will even go so far as to read the declaration
after you read it once in the old fashioned way
you read it once more with judge douglas's version
it will then run thus
we told these truths to be self evident
that all british subjects who were on this continent eighty one years ago
were created equal to all british subjects born and then residing in great britain
the very dred scott case affords a strong test as to which party most favours amalgamation
the republicans or the dear union saving democracy
dred scott
his wife and two daughters
were all involved in the suit
we desired the court to have held that they were citizens
so far at least as to entitle them to a hearing as to whether they were free or not and then also
that they were in fact and in law really free
could we have had our way
the chances of these black girls ever mixing their blood with that of white people would have been diminished at least to the extent that it could not have been without their consent
but judge douglas is delighted to have them decided to be slaves
and not human enough to have a hearing
even if they were free
and thus left subject to the forced concubinage of their masters
and liable to become the mothers of mulattoes in spite of themselves
the very state of the case that produces nine tenths of all the mulattoes
all the mixing of the blood of the nation
a house divided against itself cannot stand
on lincoln's nomination to the united states senate
june 17
1858 if we could first know where we are
and whither we are tending
we could better judge what to do
and how to do it
we are now far into the fifth year since a policy was initiated with the avowed object and confident promise of putting an end to slavery agitation
under the operation of that policy
that agitation has not only not ceased
but has constantly augmented
in my opinion it will not cease until a crisis shall have been reached and passed
a house divided against itself cannot stand
i believe this government cannot endure permanently
half slave and half free
i do not expect the union to be dissolved
i do not expect the house to fall but i do expect it will cease to be divided
it will become all one thing
or all the other
either the opponents of slavery will arrest the further spread of it
and place it where the public mind shall rest in the belief that it is in the course of ultimate extinction or its advocates will push it forward till it shall become alike lawful in all the states
old as well as new
north as well as south
have we no tendency to the latter condition
let any one who doubts
carefully contemplate that now almost complete legal combination piece of machinery
so to speak compounded of the nebraska doctrine and the dred scott decision
let him consider not only what work the machinery is adapted to do
and how well adapted but also let him study the history of its construction
and trace
if he can
or rather fail
if he can
to trace the evidences of design and concert of action among its chief architects from the beginning
the new year of 1854 found slavery excluded from more than half the states by state constitutions
and from most of the national territory by congressional prohibition
four days later commenced the struggle which ended in repealing that congressional prohibition
this opened all the national territory to slavery
and was the first point gained
but so far
congress only had acted and an indorsement by the people
real or apparent
was indispensable to save the point already gained and give chance for more
this necessity had not been overlooked
but had been provided for
as well as might be
in the notable argument of squatter sovereignty
otherwise called sacred right of self government
which latter phrase
though expressive of the only rightful basis of any government
was so perverted in this attempted use of it
as to amount to just this
that if any one man choose to enslave another
no third man shall be allowed to object
that argument was incorporated into the nebraska bill itself
in the language which follows
it being the true intent and meaning of this act
not to legislate slavery into any territory or state
nor to exclude it therefrom but to leave the people thereof perfectly free to form and regulate their domestic institutions in their own way
subject only to the constitution of the united states
then opened the roar of loose declamation in favour of squatter sovereignty and sacred right of self government
said opposition members
let us amend the bill so as to expressly declare that the people of the territory may exclude slavery
not we
said the friends of the measure
and down they voted the amendment
while the nebraska bill was passing through congress
a law case
involving the question of a negro's freedom
by reason of his owner having voluntarily taken him first into a free state and then into a territory covered by the congressional prohibition
and held him as a slave for a long time in each
was passing through the united states circuit court for the district of missouri and both nebraska bill and law suit were brought to a decision
in the same month of may
the negro's name was dred scott
which name now designates the decision finally rendered in the case
before the then next presidential election
the law case came to
and was argued
in the supreme court of the united states but the decision of it was deferred until after the election
before the election
senator trumbull
on the floor of the senate
requested the leading advocate of the nebraska bill to state his opinion whether the people of a territory can constitutionally exclude slavery from their limits
and the latter answers
that is a question for the supreme court
the election came
buchanan was elected
and the indorsement
such as it was
that was the second point gained
the indorsement
fell short of a clear popular majority by nearly four hundred thousand votes
and so
was not overwhelmingly reliable and satisfactory
the outgoing president
in his last annual message
as impressively as possible echoed back upon the people the weight and authority of the indorsement
the supreme court met again did not announce their decision
but ordered a reargument
the presidential inauguration came
and still no decision of the court but the incoming president in his inaugural address fervently exhorted the people to abide by the forthcoming decision
whatever it might be
in a few days
came the decision
the reputed author of the nebraska bill finds an early occasion to make a speech at this capitol
indorsing the dred scott decision
and vehemently denouncing all opposition to it
the new president
seizes the early occasion of the silliman letter to indorse and strongly construe that decision
and to express his astonishment that any different view had ever been entertained
at length a squabble springs up between the president and the author of the nebraska bill
on the mere question of fact whether the lecompton constitution was
or was not
in any just sense
made by the people of kansas and in that quarrel
the latter declares that all he wants is a fair vote for the people
and that he cares not whether slavery be voted down or voted up
i do not understand his declaration that he cares not whether slavery be voted down or voted up
to be intended by him other than as an apt definition of the policy he would impress upon the public mind
the principle for which he declares he has suffered so much
and is ready to suffer to the end
and well may he cling to that principle
if he has any parental feeling
well may he cling to it
that principle is the only shred left of his original nebraska doctrine
under the dred scott decision
squatter sovereignty squatted out of existence
tumbled down like temporary scaffolding like the mould at the foundry
it served through one blast
and fell back into loose sand
helped to carry an election
and then was kicked to the winds
his late joint struggle with the republicans against the lecompton constitution
involves nothing of the original nebraska doctrine
that struggle was made on a point the right of the people to make their own constitution upon which he and the republicans have never differed
the several points of the dred scott decision in connection with senator douglas's care not policy
constitute the piece of machinery in its present state of advancement
this was the third point gained
the working points of that machinery are
that no negro slave
imported as such from africa
and no descendant of such slave
can ever be a citizen of any state
in the sense of that term as used in the constitution of the united states
this point is made in order to deprive the negro
in every possible event
of the benefit of that provision of the united states constitution which declares that citizens of each state shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of citizens in the several states
secondly
that subject to the constitution of the united states
neither congress nor a territorial legislature can exclude slavery from any united states territory
this point is made in order that individual men may fill up the territories with slaves
without danger of losing them as property
and thus enhance the chances of permanency to the institution through all the future
that whether the holding a negro in actual slavery in a free state makes him free as against the holder
the united states courts will not decide
but will leave to be decided by the courts of any slave state the negro may be forced into by the master
this point is made
not to be pressed immediately but if acquiesced in for a while
and apparently indorsed by the people at an election
then to sustain the logical conclusion that what dred scott's master might lawfully do with dred scott in the free state of illinois
every other master may lawfully do
with any other one
or one thousand slaves in illinois
or in any other free state
auxiliary to all this
and working hand in hand with it
the nebraska doctrine
or what is left of it
is to educate and mould public opinion not to care whether slavery is voted down or voted up
this shows exactly where we now are
and partially
whither we are tending
it will throw additional light on the latter
to go back
and run the mind over the string of historical facts already stated
several things will now appear less dark and mysterious than they did when they were transpiring
the people were to be left perfectly free
subject only to the constitution
what the constitution had to do with it
outsiders could not then see
plainly enough now
it was an exactly fitted niche for the dred scott decision to afterwards come in
and declare the perfect freedom of the people to be just no freedom at all
why was the amendment expressly declaring the right of the people voted down
plainly enough now
the adoption of it would have spoiled the niche for the dred scott decision
why was the court decision held up
why even a senator's individual opinion withheld till after the presidential election
plainly enough now
the speaking out then would have damaged the perfectly free argument upon which the election was to be carried
why the outgoing president's felicitation on the indorsement
why the delay of a reargument
why the incoming president's advance exhortation in favour of the decision
these things look like the cautious patting and petting of a spirited horse
preparatory to mounting him
when it is dreaded that he may give the rider a fall
and why the hasty after indorsement of the decision by the president and others
we cannot absolutely know that all these adaptations are the result of preconcert
but when we see a lot of framed timbers
different portions of which we know have been gotten out at different times and places
and by different workmen stephen
and james
for instance douglas
and when we see those timbers joined together
and see they exactly make the frame of a house or a mill
all the tenons and mortices exactly fitting
and all the lengths and proportions of the different pieces exactly adapted to their respective places
and not a piece too many or too few
not omitting even scaffolding or if a single piece be lacking
we see the place in the frame exactly fitted and prepared yet to bring such piece in
in such a case
we find it impossible not to believe that stephen and franklin and roger and james all understood one another from the beginning
and all worked upon a common plan or draft
drawn up before the first blow was struck
it should not be overlooked that by the nebraska bill the people of a state as well as territory were to be left perfectly free
subject only to the constitution
why mention a state
they were legislating for territories
and not for or about states
certainly the people of a state are and ought to be subject to the constitution of the united states but why is mention of this lugged into this merely territorial law
why are the people of a territory and the people of a state therein lumped together
and their relation to the constitution therein treated as being precisely the same
while the opinion of the court by chief justice taney
in the dred scott case
and the separate opinions of all the concurring judges
expressly declare that the constitution of the united states neither permits congress nor a territorial legislature to exclude slavery from any united states territory
they all omit to declare whether or not the same constitution permits a state or the people of a state to exclude it
possibly this is a mere omission but who can be quite sure if mclean or curtis had sought to get into the opinion a declaration of unlimited power in the people of a state to exclude slavery from their limits
just as chase and mace sought to get such declaration in behalf of the people of a territory
into the nebraska bill
i ask
who can be quite sure that it would not have been voted down in the one case as it had been in the other
the nearest approach to the point of declaring the power of a state over slavery is made by judge nelson
he approaches it more than once
using the precise idea
and almost the language too
of the nebraska act
on one occasion his exact language is except in cases where the power is restrained by the constitution of the united states
the law of the state is supreme over the subject of slavery within its jurisdiction
in what cases the power of the state is so restrained by the united states constitution is left an open question
precisely as the same question
as to the restraint on the power of the territories
was left open in the nebraska act
put this and that together
and we have another nice little niche
which we may
ere long
see filled with another supreme court decision
declaring that the constitution of the united states does not permit a state to exclude slavery from its limits
and this may especially be expected if the doctrine of care not whether slavery be voted down or voted up shall gain upon the public mind sufficiently to give promise that such a decision can be maintained when made
such a decision is all that slavery now lacks of being alike lawful in all the states
welcome or unwelcome
such decision is probably coming
and will soon be upon us
unless the power of the present political dynasty shall be met and overthrown
we shall lie down
pleasantly dreaming that the people of missouri are on the verge of making their state free
and we shall awake to the reality instead
that the supreme court has made illinois a slave state
to meet and overthrow the power of that dynasty is the work now before all those who would prevent that consummation
that is what we have to do
how can we best do it
there are those who denounce us openly to their own friends
and yet whisper to us softly that senator douglas is the aptest instrument there is with which to effect that object
they wish us to infer all from the fact that he now has a little quarrel with the present head of that dynasty
and that he has regularly voted with us on a single point
upon which he and we have never differed
they remind us that he is a great man and that the largest of us are very small ones
let this be granted
but a living dog is better than a dead lion
judge douglas
if not a dead lion
for this work is at least a caged and toothless one
how can he oppose the advances of slavery
he don't care anything about it
his avowed mission is impressing the public heart to care nothing about it
a leading douglas democratic newspaper thinks douglas's superior talent will be needed to resist the revival of the african slave trade
does douglas believe an effort to revive that trade is approaching
he has not said so
does he really think so
but if it is
how can he resist it
for years he has laboured to prove it a sacred right of white men to take negro slaves into the new territories
can he possibly show that it is a less sacred right to buy them where they can be bought cheapest
and unquestionably they can be bought cheaper in africa than in virginia
he has done all in his power to reduce the whole question of slavery to one of a mere right of property
as such
how can he oppose the foreign slave trade
how can he refuse that trade in that property shall be perfectly free
unless he does it as a protection to home production
and as the home producers will probably not ask the protection
he will be wholly without a ground of opposition
senator douglas holds
we know
that a man may rightfully be wiser to day than he was yesterday that he may rightfully change when he finds himself wrong
but can we
for that reason
run ahead
and infer that he will make any particular change
of which he himself has given no intimation
can we safely base our action upon any such vague inference
as ever
i wish not to misrepresent judge douglas's position
question his motives
or do aught that can be personally offensive to him
if ever
he and we can come together on principle
so that our cause may have assistance from his great ability
i hope to have interposed no adventitious obstacle
he is not now with us he does not pretend to be he does not promise ever to be
our cause
must be intrusted to
and conducted by
its own undoubted friends those whose hands are free
whose hearts are in the work
who do care for the result
two years ago the republicans of the nation mustered over thirteen hundred thousand strong
we did this under the single impulse of resistance to a common danger
with every external circumstance against us
of strange
and even hostile elements
we gathered from the four winds
and formed and fought the battle through
under the constant hot fire of a disciplined
and pampered enemy
did we brave all then to falter now
when that same enemy is wavering
and belligerent
the result is not doubtful
we shall not fail
if we stand firm
we shall not fail
wise counsels may accelerate or mistakes delay it but sooner or later the victory is sure to come
lincoln's reply to judge douglas at chicago on popular sovereignty
the nebraska bill
july 10
popular sovereignty
everlasting popular sovereignty
let us for a moment inquire into this vast matter of popular sovereignty
what is popular sovereignty
we recollect that at an early period in the history of this struggle
there was another name for the same thing
squatter sovereignty
it was not exactly popular sovereignty
but squatter sovereignty
what do these terms mean
what do those terms mean when used now
and vast credit is taken by our friend
the judge
in regard to his support of it
when he declares the last years of his life have been
and all the future years of his life shall be
devoted to this matter of popular sovereignty
what is it
it is the sovereignty of the people
what was squatter sovereignty
i suppose
if it had any signification at all
it was the right of the people to govern themselves
to be sovereign in their own affairs
while they were squatted down in a country not their own
while they had squatted on a territory that did not belong to them
in the sense that a state belongs to the people who inhabit it
when it belonged to the nation such right to govern themselves was called squatter sovereignty
now
i wish you to mark
what has become of that squatter sovereignty
what has become of it
can you get anybody to tell you now that the people of a territory have any authority to govern themselves
in regard to this mooted question of slavery
before they form a state constitution
no such thing at all
although there is a general running fire
and although there has been a hurrah made in every speech on that side
assuming that policy had given to the people of a territory the right to govern themselves upon this question yet the point is dodged
to day it has been decided no more than a year ago it was decided by the supreme court of the united states
and is insisted upon to day that the people of a territory have no right to exclude slavery from a territory that if any one man chooses to take slaves into a territory
all the rest of the people have no right to keep them out
this being so
and this decision being made
one of the points that the judge approved
and one in the approval of which he says he means to keep me down
put me down i should not say
for i have never been up
he says he is in favour of it
and sticks to it
and expects to win his battle on that decision
which says that there is no such thing as squatter sovereignty
but that any one man may take slaves into a territory
and all the other men in the territory may be opposed to it
and yet by reason of the constitution they cannot prohibit it
when that is so
how much is left of this vast matter of squatter sovereignty
i should like to know
when we get back
we get to the point of the right of the people to make a constitution
kansas was settled
for example
in 1854
it was a territory yet
without having formed a constitution
in a very regular way
for three years
all this time negro slavery could be taken in by any few individuals
and by that decision of the supreme court
which the judge approves
all the rest of the people cannot keep it out but when they come to make a constitution they may say they will not have slavery
but it is there they are obliged to tolerate it in some way
and all experience shows it will be so
for they will not take the negro slaves and absolutely deprive the owners of them
all experience shows this to be so
all that space of time that runs from the beginning of the settlement of the territory until there is a sufficiency of people to make a state constitution
all that portion of time popular sovereignty is given up
the seal is absolutely put down upon it by the court decision
and judge douglas puts his own upon the top of that yet he is appealing to the people to give him vast credit for his devotion to popular sovereignty
when we get to the question of the right of the people to form a state constitution as they please
to form it with slavery or without slavery
if that is anything new i confess i don't know it
has there ever been a time when anybody said that any other than the people of a territory itself should form a constitution
what is now in it that judge douglas should have fought several years of his life
and pledge himself to fight all the remaining years of his life for
can judge douglas find anybody on earth that said that anybody else should form a constitution for a people
it is enough for my purpose to ask
whenever a republican said anything against it
they never said anything against it
but they have constantly spoken for it and whosoever will undertake to examine the platform and the speeches of responsible men of the party
and of irresponsible men
if you please
will be unable to find one word from anybody in the republican ranks opposed to that popular sovereignty which judge douglas thinks he has invented
i suppose that judge douglas will claim in a little while that he is the inventor of the idea that the people should govern themselves that nobody ever thought of such a thing until he brought it forward
we do not remember that in that old declaration of independence it is said that we hold these truths to be self evident
that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights that among these are life
and the pursuit of happiness that to secure these rights
governments are instituted among men
deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed
there is the origin of popular sovereignty
shall come in at this day and claim that he invented it
the lecompton constitution connects itself with this question
for it is in this matter of the lecompton constitution that our friend judge douglas claims such vast credit
i agree that in opposing the lecompton constitution
so far as i can perceive
he was right
i do not deny that at all and
you will readily see why i could not deny it
even if i wanted to
but i do not wish to
for all the republicans in the nation opposed it
and they would have opposed it just as much without judge douglas's aid as with it
they had all taken ground against it long before he did
the reason that he urges against that constitution i urged against him a year before
i have the printed speech in my hand
the argument that he makes why that constitution should not be adopted
that the people were not fairly represented nor allowed to vote
i pointed out in a speech a year ago
which i hold in my hand now
that no fair chance was to be given to the people
a little more now as to this matter of popular sovereignty and the lecompton constitution
the lecompton constitution
as the judge tells us
was defeated
the defeat of it was a good thing
or it was not
he thinks the defeat of it was a good thing
and so do i and we agree in that
who defeated it
a voice
judge douglas
yes
he furnished himself and if you suppose he controlled the other democrats that went with him
he furnished three votes
while the republicans furnished twenty
that is what he did to defeat it
in the house of representatives he and his friends furnished some twenty votes
and the republicans furnished ninety odd
who was it that did the work
a voice
why
douglas did it
to be sure he did
let us
put that proposition another way
the republicans could not have done it without judge douglas
could he have done it without them
which could have come the nearest to doing it without the other
ground was taken against it by the republicans long before douglas did it
the proposition of opposition to that measure is about five to one
a voice
why don't they come out on it
you don't know what you are talking about
my friend i am quite willing to answer any gentleman in the crowd who asks an intelligent question
who in all this country has ever found any of our friends of judge douglas's way of thinking
and who have acted upon this main question
that have ever thought of uttering a word in behalf of judge trumbull
i defy you to show a printed resolution passed in a democratic meeting
i take it upon myself to defy any man to show a printed resolution
large or small
of a democratic meeting in favour of judge trumbull
or any of the five to one republicans who beat that bill
everything must be for the democrats
they did everything
and the five to the one that really did the thing
they snub over
and they do not seem to remember that they have an existence upon the face of the earth
i fear that i shall become tedious
i leave this branch of the subject to take hold of another
i take up that part of judge douglas's speech in which he respectfully attended to me
judge douglas made two points upon my recent speech at springfield
he says they are to be the issues of this campaign
the first one of these points he bases upon the language in a speech which i delivered at springfield
which i believe i can quote correctly from memory
i said that we are now far into the fifth year since a policy was instituted for the avowed object and with the confident promise of putting an end to slavery agitation under the operation of that policy
that agitation has not only not ceased
but has constantly augmented
i believe it will not cease until a crisis shall have been reached and passed
a house divided against itself cannot stand
 i believe this government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free
i do not expect the union to be dissolved
i am quoting from my speech
i do not expect the house to fall
but i do expect it will cease to be divided
it will become all one thing or all the other
either the opponents of slavery will arrest the further spread of it
and place it where the public mind shall rest in the belief that it is in the course of ultimate extinction
or its advocates will push it forward until it shall become alike lawful in all the states
old as well as new north as well as south
that is the paragraph
in this paragraph which i have quoted in your hearing
and to which i ask the attention of all
judge douglas thinks he discovers great political heresy
i want your attention particularly to what he has inferred from it
he says i am in favour of making all the states of this union uniform in all their internal regulations that in all their domestic concerns i am in favour of making them entirely uniform
he draws this inference from the language i have quoted to you
he says that i am in favour of making war by the north upon the south for the extinction of slavery that i am also in favour of inviting as he expresses it the south to a war upon the north for the purpose of nationalizing slavery
it is singular enough
if you will carefully read that passage over
that i did not say that i was in favour of anything in it
i only said what i expected would take place
i made a prediction only
it may have been a foolish one
i did not even say that i desired that slavery should be put in course of ultimate extinction
i do say so now
however so there need be no longer any difficulty about that
it may be written down in the great speech
judge douglas informed you that this speech of mine was probably carefully prepared
i admit that it was
i am not master of language i have not a fine education i am not capable of entering into a disquisition upon dialectics
as i believe you call it but i do not believe the language i employed bears any such construction as judge douglas puts upon it
but i don't care about a quibble in regard to words
i know what i meant
and i will not leave this crowd in doubt
if i can explain it to them
what i really meant in the use of that paragraph
i am not
in the first place
unaware that this government has endured eighty two years
half slave and half free
i know that
i am tolerably well acquainted with the history of the country
and i know that it has endured eighty two years
half slave and half free
i believe and that is what i meant to allude to there i believe it has endured
during all that time
until the introduction of the nebraska bill
the public mind did rest all the time in the belief that slavery was in course of ultimate extinction
that was what gave us the rest that we had through that period of eighty two years at least
so i believe
i have always hated slavery
i think
as much as any abolitionist
i have been an old line whig
i have always hated it
but i have always been quiet about it until this new era of the introduction of the nebraska bill began
i always believed that everybody was against it
and that it was in course of ultimate extinction
they had reason so to believe
the adoption of the constitution and its attendant history led the people to believe so
and that such was the belief of the framers of the constitution itself
why did those old men
about the time of the adoption of the constitution
decree that slavery should not go into the new territory where it had not already gone
why declare that within twenty years the african slave trade
by which slaves are supplied
might be cut off by congress
why were all these acts
i might enumerate more of these acts but enough
what were they but a clear indication that the framers of the constitution intended and expected the ultimate extinction of that institution
and now when i say
as i said in my speech that judge douglas has quoted from
when i say that i think the opponents of slavery will resist the further spread of it
and place it where the public mind shall rest in the belief that it is in the course of ultimate extinction
i only mean to say that they will place it where the founders of this government originally placed it
i have said a hundred times
and i have now no inclination to take it back
that i believe there is no right
and ought to be no inclination in the people of the free states
to enter into the slave states and interfere with the question of slavery at all
i have said that always judge douglas has heard me say it
and when it is said that i am in favour of interfering with slavery where it exists
i know it is unwarranted by anything i have ever intended
as i believe
by anything i have ever said
if by any means i have ever used language which could fairly be so construed as
i believe i never have
i now correct it
so much
for the inference that judge douglas draws
that i am in favour of setting the sections at war with one another
i know that i never meant any such thing
and i believe that no fair mind can infer any such thing from anything i have said
in relation to his inference that i am in favour of a general consolidation of all the local institutions of the various states
i have said very many times in judge douglas's hearing that no man believed more than i in the principle of self government that it lies at the bottom of all my ideas of just government from beginning to end
i have denied that his use of that term applies properly
but for the thing itself i deny that any man has ever gone ahead of me in his devotion to the principle
whatever he may have done in efficiency in advocating it
i think that i have said it in your hearing
that i believe each individual is naturally entitled to do as he pleases with himself and the fruit of his labour
so far as it in no wise interferes with any other man's rights that each community
as a state
has a right to do exactly as it pleases with all the concerns within that state that interfere with the right of no other state and that the general government upon principle has no right to interfere with anything other than that general class of things that does concern the whole
i have said that at all times i have said as illustrations that i do not believe in the right of illinois to interfere with the cranberry laws of indiana
the oyster laws of virginia
or the liquor laws of maine
how is it
that judge douglas infers
because i hope to see slavery put where the public mind shall rest in the belief that it is in the course of ultimate extinction
that i am in favour of illinois going over and interfering with the cranberry laws of indiana
what can authorize him to draw any such inference
i suppose there might be one thing that at least enabled him to draw such an inference
that would not be true with me or many others that is
because he looks upon all this matter of slavery as an exceedingly little thing
this matter of keeping one sixth of the population of the whole nation in a state of oppression and tyranny unequalled in the world
he looks upon it as being an exceedingly little thing
only equal to the question of the cranberry laws of indiana as something having no moral question in it as something on a par with the question of whether a man shall pasture his land with cattle or plant it with tobacco so little and so small a thing that he concludes
if i could desire that anything should be done to bring about the ultimate extinction of that little thing
i must be in favour of bringing about an amalgamation of all the other little things in the union
it so happens and there
i presume
is the foundation of this mistake that the judge thinks thus and it so happens that there is a vast portion of the american people that do not look upon that matter as being this very little thing
they look upon it as a vast moral evil they can prove it as such by the writings of those who gave us the blessings of liberty which we enjoy
and that they so looked upon it
and not as an evil merely confining itself to the states where it is situated and while we agree that by the constitution we assented to
in the states where it exists we have no right to interfere with it
because it is in the constitution
we are both by duty and inclination to stick by that constitution in all its letter and spirit from beginning to end
so much
as to my disposition
my wish
to have all the state legislatures blotted out and to have one consolidated government and a uniformity of domestic regulations in all the states by which i suppose it is meant
if we raise corn here we must make sugar cane grow here too
and we must make those things which grow north grow in the south
all this i suppose he understands i am in favour of doing
so much for all this nonsense for i must call it so
the judge can have no issue with me on a question of establishing uniformity in the domestic regulations of the states
a little now on the other point
the dred scott decision
another of the issues
he says
that is to be made with me is upon his devotion to the dred scott decision and my opposition to it
i have expressed heretofore
and i now repeat
my opposition to the dred scott decision but i should be allowed to state the nature of that opposition
and i ask your indulgence while i do so
what is fairly implied by the term judge douglas has used
resistance to the decision
i do not resist it
if i wanted to take dred scott from his master i would be interfering with property
and that terrible difficulty that judge douglas speaks of
of interfering with property
would arise
but i am doing no such thing as that all that i am doing is refusing to obey it as a political rule
if i were in congress
and a vote should come up on a question whether slavery should be prohibited in a new territory
in spite of the dred scott decision
i would vote that it should
that is what i would do
judge douglas said last night that before the decision he might advance his opinion
and it might be contrary to the decision when it was made but after it was made he would abide by it until it was reversed
just so
we let this property abide by the decision
but we will try to reverse that decision
we will try to put it where judge douglas would not object
for he says he will obey it until it is reversed
somebody has to reverse that decision
since it is made and we mean to reverse it
and we mean to do it peaceably
what are the uses of decisions of courts
they have two uses
they decide upon the question before the court
they decide in this case that dred scott is a slave
nobody resists that
not only that
but they say to everybody else that persons standing just as dred scott stands are as he is
that is
they say that when a question comes up upon another person it will be so decided again
unless the court decides another way
unless the court overrules its decision
we mean to do what we can to have the court decide the other way
that is one thing we mean to try to do
the sacredness that judge douglas throws around this decision is a degree of sacredness that has never been before thrown around any other decision
i have never heard of such a thing
decisions apparently contrary to that decision
or that good lawyers thought were contrary to that decision
have been made by that very court before
it is the first of its kind it is an astonisher in legal history it is a new wonder of the world it is based upon falsehood in the main as to the facts
allegations of facts upon which it stands are not facts at all in many instances
and no decision made on any question the first instance of a decision made under so many unfavourable circumstances thus placed
has ever been held by the profession as law
and it has always needed confirmation before the lawyers regarded it as settled law but judge douglas will have it that all hands must take this extraordinary decision made under these extraordinary circumstances and give their vote in congress in accordance with it
yield to it
and obey it in every possible sense
circumstances alter cases
do not gentlemen here remember the case of that same supreme court some twenty five or thirty years ago
deciding that a national bank was constitutional
i ask if somebody does not remember that a national bank was declared to be constitutional
such is the truth
whether it be remembered or not
the bank charter ran out
and a re charter was granted by congress
that re charter was laid before general jackson
it was urged upon him
when he denied the constitutionality of the bank
that the supreme court had decided that it was constitutional and general jackson then said that the supreme court had no right to lay down a rule to govern a coordinate branch of the government
the members of which had sworn to support the constitution
that each member had sworn to support the constitution as he understood it
i will venture here to say that i have heard judge douglas say that he approved of general jackson for that act
what has now become of all his tirade against resistance to the supreme court
my fellow citizens
getting back a little
for i pass from these points
when judge douglas makes his threat of annihilation upon the alliance
he is cautious to say that that warfare of his is to fall upon the leaders of the republican party
almost every word he utters and every distinction he makes has its significance
he means for the republicans who do not count themselves as leaders to be his friends he makes no fuss over them
it is the leaders that he is making war upon
he wants it understood that the mass of the republican party are really his friends
it is only the leaders that are doing something
that are intolerant
and require extermination at his hands
as this is clearly and unquestionably the light in which he presents that matter
i want to ask your attention
addressing myself to republicans here
that i may ask you some questions as to where you
as the republican party
would be placed if you sustained judge douglas in his present position by a re election
i do not claim
to be unselfish i do not pretend that i would not like to go to the united states senate
i make no such hypocritical pretence but i do say to you
that in this mighty issue it is nothing to you
nothing to the mass of the people of the nation
whether or not judge douglas or myself shall ever be heard of after this night
it may be a trifle to either of us but in connection with this mighty question
upon which hang the destinies of the nation
it is absolutely nothing
but where will you be placed if you reindorse judge douglas
don't you know how apt he is
how exceedingly anxious he is
at all times to seize upon anything and everything to persuade you that something he has done you did yourselves
he tried to persuade you last night that our illinois legislature instructed him to introduce the nebraska bill
there was nobody in that legislature ever thought of it but still he fights furiously for the proposition and that he did it because there was a standing instruction to our senators to be always introducing nebraska bills
he tells you he is for the cincinnati platform he tells you he is for the dred scott decision he tells you not in his speech last night
but substantially in a former speech that he cares not if slavery is voted up or down he tells you the struggle on lecompton is past
it may come up again or not
and if it does
he stands where he stood when
in spite of him and his opposition
you built up the republican party
if you indorse him
you tell him you do not care whether slavery be voted up or down
and he will close
or try to close
your mouths with his declaration
repeated by the day
the week
the month
and the year
i think
in the position in which judge douglas stood in opposing the lecompton constitution
he was right he does not know that it will return
but if it does we may know where to find him and if it does not
we may know where to look for him
and that is on the cincinnati platform
i could ask the republican party
after all the hard names judge douglas has called them by
all his declarations of black republicanism by the way
we are improving
the black has got rubbed off
but with all that
if he be indorsed by republican votes
where do you stand
you stand ready saddled
and harnessed
and waiting to be driven over to the slavery extension camp of the nation
just ready to be driven over
tied together in a lot
to be driven over
every man with a rope around his neck
that halter being held by judge douglas
that is the question
if republican men have been in earnest in what they have done
i think they had better not do it but i think the republican party is made up of those who
as far as they can peaceably
will oppose the extension of slavery
and who will hope for its ultimate extinction
if they believe it is wrong in grasping up the new lands of the continent
and keeping them from the settlement of free white labourers
who want the land to bring up their families upon if they are in earnest
although they may make a mistake
they will grow restless
and the time will come when they will come back again and reorganize
if not by the same name
at least upon the same principles as their party now has
it is better
to save the work while it is begun
you have done the labour maintain it
keep it
if men choose to serve you
go with them but as you have made up your organization upon principle
stand by it for
as surely as god reigns over you
and has inspired your minds and given you a sense of propriety and continues to give you hope
so surely will you still cling to these ideas
and you will at last come back again after your wanderings
merely to do your work over again
we were often
more than once
at least
in the course of judge douglas's speech last night
reminded that this government was made for white men
that he believed it was made for white men
that is putting it into a shape in which no one wants to deny it but the judge then goes into his passion for drawing inferences that are not warranted
i protest
now and for ever
against that counterfeit logic which presumes that
because i do not want a negro woman for a slave
i do necessarily want her for a wife
my understanding is
that i need not have her for either but
as god made us separate
we can leave one another alone
and do one another much good thereby
there are white men enough to marry all the white women
and enough black men to marry all the black women and in god's name let them be so married
the judge regales us with the terrible enormities that take place by the mixture of races that the inferior race bears the superior down
if we do not let them get together in the territories
they won't mix there
i should say at least that that was a self evident truth
it happens that we meet together once every year
somewhere about the 4th of july
for some reason or other
these 4th of july gatherings
i suppose
have their uses
if you will indulge me
i will state what i suppose to be some of them
we are now a mighty nation
we are thirty
or about thirty
millions of people
and we own and inhabit about one fifteenth part of the dry land of the whole earth
we run our memory back over the pages of history for about eighty two years
and we discover that we were then a very small people in point of numbers
vastly inferior to what we are now
with a vastly less extent of country
with vastly less of everything we deem desirable among men
we look upon the change as exceedingly advantageous to us and to our posterity
and we fix upon something that happened away back
as in some way or other being connected with this rise of prosperity
we find a race of men living in that day whom we claim as our fathers and grandfathers they were iron men they fought for the principle that they were contending for
and we understand that by what they then did
it has followed that the degree of prosperity which we now enjoy has come to us
we hold this annual celebration to remind ourselves of all the good done in this process of time
of how it was done
and who did it
and how we are historically connected with it and we go from these meetings in better humour with ourselves
we feel more attached the one to the other
and more firmly bound to the country we inhabit
in every way we are better men
in the age and race and country in which we live
for these celebrations
but after we have done all this
we have not yet reached the whole
there is something else connected with it
we have
besides these men descended by blood from our ancestors among us
perhaps half our people who are not descendants at all of these men they are men who have come from europe
and scandinavian
men that have come from europe themselves
or whose ancestors have come hither and settled here
finding themselves our equal in all things
if they look back through this history
to trace their connection with those days by blood
they find they have none
they cannot carry themselves back into that glorious epoch and make themselves feel that they are part of us but when they look through that old declaration of independence
they find that those old men say that we hold these truths to be self evident
that all men are created equal
and then they feel that that moral sentiment taught in that day evidences their relation to those men
that it is the father of all moral principle in them
and that they have a right to claim it as though they were blood of the blood
and flesh of the flesh
of the men who wrote that declaration and so they are
that is the electric cord in that declaration that links the hearts of patriotic and liberty loving men together that will link those patriotic hearts as long as the love of freedom exists in the minds of men throughout the world
for the purpose of squaring things with this idea of don't care if slavery is voted up or voted down for sustaining the dred scott decision for holding that the declaration of independence did not mean anything at all
we have judge douglas giving his exposition of what the declaration of independence means
and we have him saying that the people of america are equal to the people of england
according to his construction
you germans are not connected with it
i ask you in all soberness
if all these things
if indulged in
if ratified
if confirmed and indorsed
if taught to our children and repeated to them
do not tend to rub out the sentiment of liberty in the country
and to transform this government into a government of some other form
those arguments that are made
that the inferior race are to be treated with as much allowance as they are capable of enjoying that as much is to be done for them as their condition will allow
what are these arguments
they are the arguments that kings have made for enslaving the people in all ages of the world
you will find that all the arguments in favour of kingcraft were of this class they always bestrode the necks of the people
not that they wanted to do it
but because the people were better off for being ridden
that is their argument and this argument of the judge is the same old serpent
that says
you work
and i eat you toil
and i will enjoy the fruits of it
turn in whatever way you will
whether it come from the mouth of a king
an excuse for enslaving the people of his country
or from the mouth of men of one race as a reason for enslaving the men of another race
it is all the same old serpent and i hold
if that course of argumentation that is made for the purpose of convincing the public mind that we should not care about this
should be granted
it does not stop with the negro
i should like to know taking this old declaration of independence
which declares that all men are equal
upon principle
and making exceptions to it where will it stop
if one man says it does not mean a negro
why not another say it does not mean some other man
if that declaration is not the truth
let us get the statute book in which we find it
and tear it out
who is so bold as to do it
if it is not true
let us tear it out
cries of no
let us stick to it
then let us stand firmly by it
it may be argued that there are certain conditions that make necessities and impose them upon us
and to the extent that a necessity is imposed upon a man
he must submit to it
i think that was the condition in which we found ourselves when we established this government
we had slaves among us we could not get our constitution unless we permitted them to remain in slavery we could not secure the good we did secure
if we grasped for more but
having by necessity submitted to that much
it does not destroy the principle that is the charter of our liberties
let that charter stand as our standard
my friend has said to me that i am a poor hand to quote scripture
i will try it again
it is said in one of the admonitions of our lord
be ye therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect
the saviour
i suppose
did not expect that any human creature could be perfect as the father in heaven but he said
as your father in heaven is perfect
be ye also perfect
he set that up as a standard
and he who did most toward reaching that standard attained the highest degree of moral perfection
so i say in relation to the principle that all men are created equal
let it be as nearly reached as we can
if we cannot give freedom to every creature
let us do nothing that will impose slavery upon any other creature
let us
turn this government back into the channel in which the framers of the constitution originally placed it
let us stand firmly by each other
if we do not do so
we are tending in the contrary direction
that our friend judge douglas proposes
not intentionally
working in the traces that tend to make this one universal slave nation
he is one that runs in that direction
and as such i resist him
my friends
i have detained you about as long as i desired to do
and i have only to say
let us discard all this quibbling about this man and the other man
this race and that race and the other race being inferior
and therefore they must be placed in an inferior position
let us discard all these things
and unite as one people throughout this land
until we shall once more stand up declaring that all men are created equal
my friends
i could not
without launching off upon some new topic
which would detain you too long
continue to night
i thank you for this most extensive audience that you have furnished me to night
i leave you
hoping that the lamp of liberty will burn in your bosoms until there shall no longer be a doubt that all men are created free and equal
from a speech at springfield
july 17
there is still another disadvantage under which we labour
and to which i will ask your attention
it arises out of the relative positions of the two persons who stand before the state as candidates for the senate
senator douglas is of world wide renown
all the anxious politicians of his party
or who have been of his party for years past
have been looking upon him as certainly
at no distant day
to be the president of the united states
they have seen
in his round
fruitful face
and cabinet appointments
charg ships and foreign missions
bursting and sprouting out in wonderful exuberance
ready to be laid hold of by their greedy hands
and as they have been gazing upon this attractive picture so long
they cannot
in the little distraction that has taken place in the party
bring themselves to give up the charming hope
but with greedier anxiety they rush about him
sustain him
and give him marches
triumphal entries
and receptions
beyond what
even in the days of his highest prosperity
they could have brought about in his favour
on the contrary
nobody has ever expected me to be president
in my poor
lank face
nobody has ever seen that any cabbages were sprouting out
these are disadvantages
all taken together
that the republicans labour under
we have to fight this battle upon principle
and upon principle alone
i am in a certain sense made the standard bearer in behalf of the republicans
i was made so merely because there had to be some one so placed
i being in no wise preferable to any other one of the twenty five
perhaps a hundred
we have in the republican ranks
then i say
i wish it to be distinctly understood and borne in mind
that we have to fight this battle without many perhaps without any of the external aids which are brought to bear against us
so i hope those with whom i am surrounded have principle enough to nerve themselves for the task
and leave nothing undone that can fairly be done to bring about the right result
as appears by two speeches i have heard him deliver since his arrival in illinois
he gave special attention to the speech of mine delivered on the sixteenth of june
he says that he carefully read that speech
he told us that at chicago a week ago last night
and he repeated it at bloomington last night
he says it was evidently prepared with great care
i freely admit it was prepared with care
but i was very careful not to put anything in that speech as a matter of fact
or make any inferences which did not appear to me to be true and fully warrantable
if i had made any mistake i was willing to be corrected if i had drawn any inference in regard to judge douglas or any one else
which was not warranted
i was fully prepared to modify it as soon as discovered
i planted myself upon the truth and the truth only
so far as i knew it
or could be brought to know it
having made that speech with the most kindly feelings toward judge douglas
as manifested therein
i was gratified when i found that he had carefully examined it
and had detected no error of fact
nor any inference against him
nor any misrepresentations
of which he thought fit to complain
he seizes upon the doctrines he supposes to be included in that speech
and declares that upon them will turn the issues of the campaign
he then quotes
or attempts to quote
from my speech
i will not say that he wilfully misquotes
but he does fail to quote accurately
his attempt at quoting is from a passage which i believe i can quote accurately from memory
i shall make the quotation now
with some comments upon it
as i have already said
in order that the judge shall be left entirely without excuse for misrepresenting me
i do so now
as i hope
for the last time
i do this in great caution
in order that if he repeats his misrepresentation
it shall be plain to all that he does so wilfully
after all
he still persists
i shall be compelled to reconstruct the course i have marked out for myself
and draw upon such humble resources as i have for a new course
better suited to the real exigencies of the case
i set out in this campaign with the intention of conducting it strictly as a gentleman
in substance at least
if not in the outside polish
the latter i shall never be
but that which constitutes the inside of a gentleman i hope i understand
and am not less inclined to practise than others
it was my purpose and expectation that this canvass would be conducted upon principle
and with fairness on both sides
and it shall not be my fault if this purpose and expectation shall be given up
he charges
in substance
that i invite a war of sections that i propose all local institutions of the different states shall become consolidated and uniform
what is there in the language of that speech which expresses such purpose or bears such construction
i have again and again said that i would not enter into any one of the states to disturb the institution of slavery
judge douglas said at bloomington that i used language most able and ingenious for concealing what i really meant and that while i had protested against entering into the slave states
i nevertheless did mean to go on the banks of the ohio and throw missiles into kentucky
to disturb them in their domestic institutions
i have said that i do not understand the declaration to mean that all men were created equal in all respects
the negroes are not our equals in colour but i suppose it does mean to declare that all men are equal in some respects they are equal in their right to life
and the pursuit of happiness
certainly the negro is not our equal in colour
perhaps not in many other respects
in the right to put into his mouth the bread that his own hands have earned
he is the equal of every other man
white or black
in pointing out that more has been given you
you cannot be justified in taking away the little which has been given him
all i ask for the negro is
that if you do not like him
let him alone
if god gave him but little
that little let him enjoy
one more point on this springfield speech
which judge douglas says he has read so carefully
i expressed my belief in the existence of a conspiracy to perpetuate and nationalize slavery
i did not profess to know it
nor do i now
i showed the part judge douglas had played in the string of facts
constituting to my mind the proof of that conspiracy
i showed the parts played by others
i charged that the people had been deceived into carrying the last presidential election
by the impression that the people of the territories might exclude slavery if they chose
when it was known in advance by the conspirators that the court was to decide that neither congress nor the people could so exclude slavery
these charges are more distinctly made than anything else in the speech
judge douglas has carefully read and re read that speech
he has not
so far as i know
contradicted those charges
in the two speeches which i heard he certainly did not
on his own tacit admission i renew that charge
i charge him with having been a party to that conspiracy and to that deception
for the sole purpose of nationalizing slavery
from lincoln's reply to douglas in the first joint debate at ottawa
august 21
1858 when a man bears himself somewhat misrepresented
it provokes him at least
i find it so with myself but when misrepresentation becomes very gross and palpable
it is more apt to amuse him
after stating the charge of an arrangement between himself and judge trumbull
now
all i have to say upon that subject is
that i think no man not even judge douglas can prove it
because it is not true
i have no doubt he is conscientious in saying it
as to those resolutions that he took such a length of time to read
as being the platform of the republican party in 1854
i say i never had anything to do with them
and i think trumbull never had
judge douglas cannot show that either of us ever had anything to do with them
about this story that judge douglas tells of trumbull bargaining to sell out the old democratic party
and lincoln agreeing to sell out the old whig party
i have the means of knowing about that judge douglas cannot have and i know there is no substance to it whatever
a man cannot prove a negative
but he has a right to claim that when a man makes an affirmative charge
he must offer some proof to show the truth of what he says
i certainly cannot introduce testimony to show the negative about things
but i have a right to claim that if a man says he knows a thing
then he must show how he knows it
i always have a right to claim this and it is not satisfactory to me that he may be conscientious on the subject
anything that argues me into his idea of perfect social and political equality with the negro is but a specious and fantastic arrangement of words
by which a man can prove a horse chestnut to be a chestnut horse
i will say here
while upon this subject
that i have no purpose
either directly or indirectly
to interfere with the institution of slavery in the states where it exists
i believe i have no lawful right to do so
and i have no inclination to do so
i have no purpose to introduce political and social equality between the white and the black races
there is a physical difference between the two
in my judgment
will probably for ever forbid their living together upon the footing of perfect equality and inasmuch as it becomes a necessity that there must be a difference
as well as judge douglas
am in favour of the race to which i belong having the superior position
i have never said anything to the contrary but i hold
notwithstanding all this
there is no reason in the world why the negro is not entitled to all the natural rights enumerated in the declaration of independence
the right to life
and the pursuit of happiness
i hold that he is as much entitled to these as the white man
i agree with judge douglas
he is not my equal in many respects
certainly not in colour
perhaps not in moral or intellectual endowment
but in the right to eat the bread
without the leave of anybody
which his own hand earns
he is my equal
and the equal of judge douglas
and the equal of any living man
as i have not used up so much of my time as i had supposed
i will dwell a little longer upon one or two of these minor topics upon which the judge has spoken
he has read from my speech at springfield
in which i say that a house divided against itself cannot stand
does the judge say it can stand
i don't know whether he does or not
the judge does not seem to be attending to me just now
but i would like to know if it is his opinion that a house divided against itself can stand
if he does
then there is a question of veracity
not between him and me
but between the judge and an authority of a somewhat higher character
my friends
i ask your attention to this matter for the purpose of saying something seriously
i know that the judge may readily enough agree with me that the maxim which was put forth by the saviour is true
but he may allege that i misapply it and the judge has a right to urge that in my application i do misapply it
and then i have a right to show that i do not misapply it
when he undertakes to say that because i think this nation
so far as the question of slavery is concerned
will all become one thing or all the other
i am in favour of bringing about a dead uniformity in the various states
in all their institutions
he argues erroneously
the great variety of local institutions in the states
springing from differences in the soil
differences in the face of the country
and in the climate
are bonds of union
they do not make a house divided against itself
but they make a house united
if they produce in one section of the country what is called for by the wants of another section
and this other section can supply the wants of the first
they are not matters of discord
but bonds of union
true bonds of union
but can this question of slavery be considered as among these varieties in the institutions of the country
i leave it for you to say
whether in the history of our government
this institution of slavery has not always failed to be a bond of union
on the contrary
been an apple of discord and an element of division in the house
i ask you to consider whether so long as the moral constitution of men's minds shall continue to be the same
after this generation and assemblage shall sink into the grave
and another race shall arise with the same moral and intellectual development we have whether
if that institution is standing in the same irritating position in which it now is
it will not continue an element of division
if so
then i have a right to say that
in regard to this question
the union is a house divided against itself and when the judge reminds me that i have often said to him that the institution of slavery has existed for eighty years in some states
and yet it does not exist in some others
i agree to the fact
and i account for it by looking at the position in which our fathers originally placed it
restricting it from the new territories where it had not gone
and legislating to cut off its source by the abrogation of the slave trade
thus putting the seal of legislation against its spread
the public mind did rest in the belief that it was in the course of ultimate extinction
but lately
i think
and in this i charge nothing on the judge's motives
i think that he and those acting with him have placed that institution on a new basis
which looks to the perpetuity and nationalization of slavery
and while it is placed on this new basis
i say
and i have said
that i believe we shall not have peace upon the question
until the opponents of slavery arrest the further spread of it
and place it where the public mind shall rest in the belief that it is in the course of ultimate extinction or
on the other hand
that its advocates will push it forward until it shall become alike lawful in all the states
old as well as new
north as well as south
i believe if we could arrest the spread
and place it where washington and jefferson and madison placed it
it would be in the course of ultimate extinction
and the public mind would
as for eighty years past
believe that it was in the course of ultimate extinction
the crisis would be past
and the institution might be let alone for a hundred years if it should live so long in the states where it exists
yet it would be going out of existence in the way best for both the black and the white races
a voice
then do you repudiate popular sovereignty
well
let us talk about popular sovereignty
what is popular sovereignty
is it the right of the people to have slavery or not to have it
as they see fit
in the territories
i will state and i have an able man to watch me my understanding is that popular sovereignty
as now applied to the question of slavery
does allow the people of a territory to have slavery if they want to
but does not allow them not to have it if they do not want it
i do not mean that if this vast concourse of people were in a territory of the united states
any one of them would be obliged to have a slave if he did not want one but i do say that
as i understand the dred scott decision
if any one man wants slaves
all the rest have no way of keeping that one man from holding them
when i made my speech at springfield
of which the judge complains
and from which he quotes
i really was not thinking of the things which he ascribes to me at all
i had no thought in the world that i was doing anything to bring about a war between the free and slave states
i had no thought in the world that i was doing anything to bring about a political and social equality of the black and white races
it never occurred to me that i was doing anything or favouring anything to reduce to a dead uniformity all the local institutions of the various states
but i must say
in all fairness to him
if he thinks i am doing something which leads to these bad results
it is none the better that i did not mean it
it is just as fatal to the country
if i have any influence in producing it
whether i intend it or not
but can it be true that placing this institution upon the original basis the basis upon which our fathers placed it can have any tendency to set the northern and the southern states at war with one another
or that it can have any tendency to make the people of vermont raise sugar cane
because they raise it in louisiana
or that it can compel the people of illinois to cut pine logs on the grand prairie
where they will not grow
because they cut pine logs in maine
where they do grow
the judge says this is a new principle started in regard to this question
does the judge claim that he is working on the plan of the founders of the government
i think he says in some of his speeches indeed
i have one here now that he saw evidence of a policy to allow slavery to be south of a certain line
while north of it it should be excluded
and he saw an indisposition on the part of the country to stand upon that policy
he set about studying the subject upon original principles
and upon original principles he got up the nebraska bill
i am fighting it upon these original principles fighting it in the jeffersonian
madisonian fashion
if i have brought forward anything not a fact
if he judge douglas will point it out
it will not even ruffle me to take it back
but if he will not point out anything erroneous in the evidence
is it not rather for him to show by a comparison of the evidence that i have reasoned falsely
than to call the kind
intelligent gentleman a liar
i want to ask your attention to a portion of the nebraska bill which judge douglas has quoted
it being the true intent and meaning of this act
not to legislate slavery into any territory or state
nor to exclude it therefrom
but to leave the people thereof perfectly free to form and regulate their domestic institutions in their own way
subject only to the constitution of the united states
thereupon judge douglas and others began to argue in favour of popular sovereignty
the right of the people to have slaves if they wanted them
and to exclude slavery if they did not want them
said
in substance
a senator from ohio mr
i believe
we more than suspect that you do not mean to allow the people to exclude slavery if they wish to and if you do mean it
accept an amendment which i propose
expressly authorizing the people to exclude slavery
i believe i have the amendment here before me
which was offered
and under which the people of the territory
through their proper representatives
if they saw fit
prohibit the existence of slavery therein
and now i state it as a fact
to be taken back if there is any mistake about it
that judge douglas and those acting with him voted that amendment down
i now think that those who voted it down had a real reason for doing so
they know what that reason was
it looks to us
since we have seen the dred scott decision pronounced
holding that under the constitution the people cannot exclude slavery i say it looks to outsiders
intelligent gentlemen
as though the niche was left as a place to put that dred scott decision in
a niche that would have been spoiled by adopting the amendment
and now i say again
if this was not the reason
it will avail the judge much more to calmly and good humouredly point out to these people what that other reason was for voting the amendment down
than swelling himself up to vociferate that he may be provoked to call somebody a liar
there is in that same quotation from the nebraska bill this clause
it being the true intent and meaning of this bill not to legislate slavery into any territory or state
i have always been puzzled to know what business the word state had in that connection
judge douglas knows he put it there
he knows what he put it there for
we outsiders cannot say what he put it there for
the law they were passing was not about states
and was not making provision for states
what was it placed there for
after seeing the dred scott decision
which holds that the people cannot exclude slavery from a territory
if another dred scott decision shall come
holding that they cannot exclude it from a state
we shall discover that when the word was originally put there
it was in view of something that was to come in due time we shall see that it was the other half of something
i now say again
if there was any different reason for putting it there
judge douglas
in a good humoured way
without calling anybody a liar
can tell what the reason was
my friends
i ask the attention of the people here assembled
and elsewhere
to the course that judge douglas is pursuing every day as bearing upon this question of making slavery national
not going back to the records
but taking the speeches he makes
the speeches he made yesterday and the day before
and makes constantly
all over the country
i ask your attention to them
in the first place
what is necessary to make the institution national
not war
there is no danger that the people of kentucky will shoulder their muskets and
march into illinois to force the blacks upon us
there is no danger of our going over there
and making war upon them
then what is necessary for the nationalization of slavery
it is simply the next dred scott decision
it is merely for the supreme court to decide that no state under the constitution can exclude it
just as they have already decided that under the constitution neither congress nor the territorial legislature can do it
when that is decided and acquiesced in
the whole thing is done
this being true and this being the way
as i think
that slavery is to be made national
let us consider what judge douglas is doing every day to that end
in the first place
let us see what influence he is exerting on public sentiment
in this and like communities
public sentiment is everything
with public sentiment nothing can fail without it nothing can succeed
consequently he who moulds public sentiment goes deeper than he who enacts statutes or pronounces decisions
he makes statutes and decisions possible or impossible to be executed
this must be borne in mind
as also the additional fact that judge douglas is a man of vast influence
so great that it is enough for many men to profess to believe anything when they once find out that judge douglas professes to believe it
consider also the attitude he occupies at the head of a large party
a party which he claims has a majority of all the voters in the country
this man sticks to a decision which forbids the people of a territory to exclude slavery
and he does so not because he says it is right in itself
he does not give any opinion on that
but because it has been decided by the court
being decided by the court
he is
and you are
bound to take it in your political action as law
not that he judges at all of its merits
but because a decision of the court is to him a thus saith the lord
he places it on that ground alone
and you will bear in mind that thus committing himself unreservedly to this decision
commits himself just as firmly to the next one as to this
he did not commit himself on account of the merit or demerit of the decision
but it is a thus saith the lord
the next decision as much as this will be a thus saith the lord
there is nothing that can divert or turn him away from this decision
it is nothing that i point out to him that his great prototype
general jackson
did not believe in the binding force of decisions
it is nothing to him that jefferson did not so believe
i have said that i have often heard him approve of jackson's course in disregarding the decision of the supreme court pronouncing a national bank constitutional
he says i did not hear him say so
he denies the accuracy of my recollection
i say he ought to know better than i
but i will make no question about this thing
though it still seems to me that i heard him say it twenty times
i will tell him
that he now claims to stand on the cincinnati platform
which affirms that congress cannot charter a national bank in the teeth of that old standing decision that congress can charter a bank
and i remind him of another piece of illinois history on the question of respect for judicial decisions
and it is a piece of illinois history belonging to a time when a large party to which judge douglas belonged
were displeased with a decision of the supreme court of illinois
because they had decided that a governor could not remove a secretary of state
and i know that judge douglas will not deny that he was then in favour of over slaughing that decision
by the mode of adding five new judges
so as to vote down the four old ones
not only so
but it ended in the judge's sitting down on the very bench as one of the five new judges to break down the four old ones
it was in this way precisely that he got his title of judge
when the judge tells me that men appointed conditionally to sit as members of a court will have to be catechized beforehand upon some subject
i say
you know
judge you have tried it
when he says a court of this kind will lose the confidence of all men
will be prostituted and disgraced by such a proceeding
i say
you know best
judge you have been through the mill
but i cannot shake judge douglas's teeth loose from the dred scott decision
like some obstinate animal i mean no disrespect that will hang on when he has once got his teeth fixed you may cut off a leg
or you may tear away an arm
still he will not relax his hold
and so i may point out to the judge
and say that he is bespattered all over
from the beginning of his political life to the present time
with attacks upon judicial decisions
i may cut off limb after limb of his public record
and strive to wrench from him a single dictum of the court
yet i cannot divert him from it
he hangs to the last to the dred scott decision
henry clay
my beau ideal of a statesman
once said of a class of men who would repress all tendencies to liberty and ultimate emancipation
that they must
if they would do this
go back to the era of our independence
and muzzle the cannon that thunders its annual joyous return that they must blow out the moral lights around us they must penetrate the human soul
and eradicate there the love of liberty and then
and not till then
could they perpetuate slavery in this country
to my thinking
judge douglas is
by his example and vast influence
doing that very thing in this community when he says that the negro has nothing in the declaration of independence
henry clay plainly understood the contrary
judge douglas is going back to the era of our revolution
to the extent of his ability
muzzling the cannon which thunders its annual joyous return
when he invites any people
willing to have slavery
to establish it
he is blowing out the moral lights around us
when he says he cares not whether slavery is voted down or voted up
that it is a sacred right of self government
he is
in my judgment
penetrating the human soul and eradicating the light of reason and the love of liberty in this american people
and now i will only say
that when
by all these means and appliances
judge douglas shall succeed in bringing public sentiment to an exact accordance with his own views when these vast assemblages shall echo back all these sentiments when they shall come to repeat his views and avow his principles
and to say all that he says on these mighty questions
then it needs only the formality of a second dred scott decision
which he indorses in advance
to make slavery alike lawful in all the states
old as well as new
north as well as south
lincoln's reply to judge douglas in the second joint debate
august 27
the plain truth is this
at the introduction of the nebraska policy
we believed there was a new era being introduced in the history of the republic
which tended to the spread and perpetuation of slavery
but in our opposition to that measure we did not agree with one another in everything
the people in the north end of the state were for stronger measures of opposition than we of the southern and central portions of the state
but we were all opposed to the nebraska doctrine
we had that one feeling and one sentiment in common
you at the north end met in your conventions
and passed your resolutions
we in the middle of the state and further south did not hold such conventions and pass the same resolutions
although we had in general a common view and a common sentiment
so that these meetings which the judge has alluded to
and the resolutions he has read from
were local
and did not spread over the whole state
we at last met together in 1856
from all parts of the state
and we agreed upon a common platform
you who held more extreme notions
either yielded those notions
or if not wholly yielding them
agreed to yield them practically
for the sake of embodying the opposition to the measures which the opposite party were pushing forward at that time
we met you then
and if there was anything yielded
it was for practical purposes
we agreed then upon a platform for the party throughout the entire state of illinois
and now we are all bound as a party to that platform
and i say here to you
if any one expects of me in the case of my election
that i will do anything not signified by our republican platform and my answers here to day
i tell you very frankly
that person will be deceived
i do not ask for the vote of any one who supposes that i have secret purposes or pledges that i dare not speak out
if i should never be elected to any office
i trust i may go down with no stain of falsehood upon my reputation
notwithstanding the hard opinions judge douglas chooses to entertain of me
from lincoln's reply at jonesboro
september 15
1858 ladies and gentlemen
there is very much in the principles that judge douglas has here enunciated that i most cordially approve
and over which i shall have no controversy with him
in so far as he insisted that all the states have the right to do exactly as they please about all their domestic relations
including that of slavery
i agree entirely with him
he places me wrong in spite of all i tell him
though i repeat it again and again
insisting that i have made no difference with him upon this subject
i have made a great many speeches
some of which have been printed
and it will be utterly impossible for him to find anything that i have ever put in print contrary to what i now say on the subject
i hold myself under constitutional obligations to allow the people in all the states
without interference
direct or indirect
to do exactly as they please
and i deny that i have any inclination to interfere with them
even if there were no such constitutional obligation
i can only say again that i am placed improperly altogether improperly
in spite of all that i can say when it is insisted that i entertain any other view or purpose in regard to that matter
while i am upon this subject
i will make some answers briefly to certain propositions that judge douglas has put
he says
why can't this union endure permanently half slave and half free
i have said that i supposed it could not
and i will try
before this new audience
to give briefly some of the reasons for entertaining that opinion
another form of his question is
why can't we let it stand as our fathers placed it
that is the exact difficulty between us
i say that judge douglas and his friends have changed it from the position in which our fathers originally placed it
i say in the way our fathers originally left the slavery question
the institution was in the course of ultimate extinction
i say when this government was first established
it was the policy of its founders to prohibit the spread of slavery into the new territories of the united states where it had not existed
but judge douglas and his friends have broken up that policy
and placed it upon a new basis
by which it is to become national and perpetual
all i have asked or desired anywhere is that it should be placed back again upon the basis that the fathers of our government originally placed it upon
i have no doubt that it would become extinct for all time to come
if we had but readopted the policy of the fathers by restricting it to the limits it has already covered restricting it from the new territories
i do not wish to dwell on this branch of the subject at great length at this time
but allow me to repeat one thing that i have stated before
the man who assaulted senator sumner on the floor of the senate
and who was complimented with dinners and silver pitchers and gold headed canes
and a good many other things for that feat
in one of his speeches declared that when this government was originally established
nobody expected that the institution of slavery would last until this day
that was but the opinion of one man
but it is such an opinion as we can never get from judge douglas or anybody in favour of slavery in the north at all
you can sometimes get it from a southern man
he said at the same time that the framers of our government did not have the knowledge that experience has taught us that experience and the invention of the cotton gin have taught us that the perpetuation of slavery is a necessity
he insisted therefore upon its being changed from the basis upon which the fathers of the government left it to the basis of perpetuation and nationalization
i insist that this is the difference between judge douglas and myself that judge douglas is helping the change along
i insist upon this government being placed where our fathers originally placed it
when he asks me why we cannot get along with it slavery in the attitude where our fathers placed it
he had better clear up the evidences that he has himself changed it from that basis that he has himself been chiefly instrumental in changing the policy of the fathers
any one who will read his speech of the twenty second of march last
will see that he there makes an open confession
showing that he set about fixing the institution upon an altogether different set of principles
in regard to this matter about a contract between myself and judge trumbull
and myself and all that long portion of judge douglas's speech on this subject
i wish simply to say
what i have said to him before
that he cannot know whether it is true or not
and i do know that there is not a word of truth in it
and i have told him so before
i don't want any harsh language indulged in
but i do not know how to deal with this persistent insisting on a story that i know to be utterly without truth
it used to be the fashion amongst men that when a charge was made
some sort of proof was brought forward to establish it
and if no proof was found to exist
it was dropped
i don't know how to meet this kind of an argument
i don't want to have a fight with judge douglas
and i have no way of making an argument up into the consistency of a corn cob and stopping his mouth with it
all i can do is good humouredly to say
that from the beginning to the end of all that story about a bargain between judge trumbull and myself
there is not a word of truth in it
when that compromise of 1850 was made
it did not repeal the old missouri compromise
it left a region of united states territory half as large as the present territory of the united states
north of the line of 36 30
in which slavery was prohibited by act of congress
this compromise did not repeal that one
it did not affect nor propose to repeal it
but at last it became judge douglas's duty
as he thought and i find no fault with him
as chairman of the committee on territories
to bring in a bill for the organization of a territorial government first of one
then of two territories north of that line
when he did so
it ended in his inserting a provision substantially repealing the missouri compromise
that was because the compromise of 1850 had not repealed it
and now i ask why he could not have left that compromise alone
we were quiet from the agitation of the slavery question
we were making no fuss about it
all had acquiesced in the compromise measures of 1850
we never had been seriously disturbed by any abolition agitation before that period
i close this part of the discussion on my part by asking him the question again
when we had peace under the missouri compromise
could you not have let it alone
he tries to persuade us that there must be a variety in the different institutions of the states of the union that that variety necessarily proceeds from the variety of soil
of the face of the country
and the difference of the natural features of the states
i agree to all that
have these very matters ever produced any difficulty amongst us
not at all
have we ever had any quarrel over the fact that they have laws in louisiana designed to regulate the commerce that springs from the production of sugar
or because we have a different class relative to the production of flour in this state
have they produced any differences
not at all
they are the very cements of this union
they don't make the house a house divided against itself
they are the props that hold up the house and sustain the union
but has it been so with this element of slavery
have we not always had quarrels and difficulties over it
and when will we cease to have quarrels over it
like causes produce like effects
it is worth while to observe that we have generally had comparative peace upon the slavery question
and that there has been no cause for alarm until it was excited by the effort to spread it into new territory
whenever it has been limited to its present bounds
and there has been no effort to spread it
there has been peace
all the trouble and convulsion has proceeded from efforts to spread it over more territory
it was thus at the date of the missouri compromise
it was so again with the annexation of texas so with the territory acquired by the mexican war and it is so now
whenever there has been an effort to spread it
there has been agitation and resistance
i appeal to this audience very few of whom are my political friends
as rational men
whether we have reason to expect that the agitation in regard to this subject will cease while the causes that tend to reproduce agitation are actively at work
will not the same cause that produced agitation in 1820
when the missouri compromise was formed
that which produced the agitation upon the annexation of texas
and at other times
work out the same results always
do you think that the nature of man will be changed that the same causes that produced agitation at one time will not have the same effect at another
this has been the result so far as my observation of the slavery question and my reading in history extend
what right have we then to hope that the trouble will cease
that the agitation will come to an end
until it shall either be placed back where it originally stood
and where the fathers originally placed it
on the other hand
until it shall entirely master all opposition
this is the view i entertain
and this is the reason why i entertained it
as judge douglas has read from my springfield speech
at freeport i answered several interrogatories that had been propounded to me by judge douglas at the ottawa meeting
at the same time i propounded four interrogatories to him
claiming it as a right that he should answer as many for me as i did for him
and i would reserve myself for a future instalment when i got them ready
the judge
in answering me upon that occasion
put in what i suppose he intends as answers to all four of my interrogatories
the first one of these i have before me
and it is in these words
question 1
if the people of kansas shall by means entirely unobjectionable in all other respects
adopt a state constitution and ask admission into the union under it
before they have the requisite number of inhabitants according to the english bill some 93
000 will you vote to admit them
as i read the judge's answer in the newspaper
and as i remember it as pronounced at the time
he does not give any answer which is equivalent to yes or no
i will or i won't
he answers at very considerable length
rather quarrelling with me for asking the question
and insisting that judge trumbull had done something that i ought to say something about and finally
getting out such statements as induce me to infer that he means to be understood
he will
in that supposed case
vote for the admission of kansas
i only bring this forward now
for the purpose of saying that
if he chooses to put a different construction upon his answer
he may do it
but if he does not
i shall from this time forward assume that he will vote for the admission of kansas in disregard of the english bill
he has the right to remove any misunderstanding i may have
i only mention it now
that i may hereafter assume this to have been the true construction of his answer
if he does not now choose to correct me
the second interrogatory i propounded to him was this
question 2
can the people of a united states territory in any lawful way
against the wish of any citizen of the united states
exclude slavery from its limits prior to the formation of a state constitution
to this judge douglas answered that they can lawfully exclude slavery from the territory prior to the formation of a constitution
he goes on to tell us how it can be done
as i understand him
he holds that it can be done by the territorial legislature refusing to make any enactments for the protection of slavery in the territory
and especially by adopting unfriendly legislation to it
for the sake of clearness
i state it again
that they can exclude slavery from the territory
by withholding what he assumes to be an indispensable assistance to it in the way of legislation and second
by unfriendly legislation
if i rightly understand him
i wish to ask your attention for a while to his position
in the first place
the supreme court of the united states has decided that any congressional prohibition of slavery in the territories is unconstitutional
they have reached this proposition as a conclusion from their former proposition that the constitution of the united states expressly recognizes property in slaves and from that other constitutional provision that no person shall be deprived of property without due process of law
hence they reach the conclusion that as the constitution of the united states expressly recognizes property in slaves
and prohibits any person from being deprived of property without due process of law
to pass an act of congress by which a man who owned a slave on one side of a line would be deprived of him if he took him on the other side
is depriving him of that property without due process of law
that i understand to be the decision of the supreme court
i understand also that judge douglas adheres most firmly to that decision and the difficulty is
how is it possible for any power to exclude slavery from the territory unless in violation of that decision
that is the difficulty
in the senate of the united states
in 1856
judge trumbull in a speech
substantially if not directly
put the same interrogatory to judge douglas
as to whether the people of a territory had the lawful power to exclude slavery prior to the formation of a constitution
judge douglas then answered at considerable length
and his answer will be found in the congressional globe
under date of june 9
the judge said that whether the people could exclude slavery prior to the formation of a constitution or not
was a question to be decided by the supreme court
he put that proposition
as will be seen by the congressional globe
in a variety of forms
all running to the same thing in substance
that it was a question for the supreme court
i maintain that when he says
after the supreme court has decided the question
that the people may yet exclude slavery by any means whatever
he does virtually say that it is not a question for the supreme court
he shifts his ground
i appeal to you whether he did not say it was a question for the supreme court
has not the supreme court decided that question
when he now says that the people may exclude slavery
does he not make it a question for the people
does he not virtually shift his ground and say that it is not a question for the court
but for the people
this is a very simple proposition
a very plain and naked one
it seems to me that there is no difficulty in deciding it
in a variety of ways he said that it was a question for the supreme court
he did not stop then to tell us that
whatever the supreme court decides
the people can by withholding necessary police regulations keep slavery out
he did not make any such answer
i submit to you now
whether the new state of the case has not induced the judge to sheer away from his original ground
would not this be the impression of every fair minded man
i hold that the proposition that slavery cannot enter a new country without police regulations is historically false
it is not true at all
i hold that the history of this country shows that the institution of slavery was originally planted upon this continent without these police regulations which the judge now thinks necessary for the actual establishment of it
not only so
but is there not another fact
how came this dred scott decision to be made
it was made upon the case of a negro being taken and actually held in slavery in minnesota territory
claiming his freedom because the act of congress prohibited his being so held there
will the judge pretend that dred scott was not held there without police regulations
there is at least one matter of record as to his having been held in slavery in the territory
not only without police regulations
but in the teeth of congressional legislation supposed to be valid at the time
this shows that there is vigour enough in slavery to plant itself in a new country
even against unfriendly legislation
it takes not only law
but the enforcement of law to keep it out
that is the history of this country upon the subject
i wish to ask one other question
it being understood that the constitution of the united states guarantees property in slaves in the territories
if there is any infringement of the right of that property
would not the united states courts
organized for the government of the territory
apply such remedy as might be necessary in that case
it is a maxim held by the courts that there is no wrong without its remedy and the courts have a remedy for whatever is acknowledged and treated as a wrong
i will ask you
my friends
if you were elected members of the legislature
what would be the first thing you would have to do before entering upon your duties
swear to support the constitution of the united states
suppose you believe as judge douglas does
that the constitution of the united states guarantees to your neighbour the right to hold slaves in that territory
that they are his property
how can you clear your oaths unless you give him such legislation as is necessary to enable him to enjoy that property
what do you understand by supporting the constitution of a state or of the united states
is it not to give such constitutional helps to the rights established by that constitution as may be practically needed
can you
if you swear to support the constitution and believe that the constitution establishes a right
clear your oath without giving it support
do you support the constitution if
knowing or believing there is a right established under it which needs specific legislation
you withhold that legislation
do you not violate and disregard your oath
i can conceive of nothing plainer in the world
there can be nothing in the words support the constitution
if you may run counter to it by refusing support to any right established under the constitution
and what i say here will hold with still more force against the judge's doctrine of unfriendly legislation
how could you
having sworn to support the constitution
and believing that it guaranteed the right to hold slaves in the territories
assist in legislation intended to defeat that right
that would be violating your own view of the constitution
not only so
but if you were to do so
how long would it take the courts to hold your votes unconstitutional and void
not a moment
i would ask
is not congress itself under obligation to give legislative support to any right that is established under the united states constitution
i repeat the question
is not congress itself bound to give legislative support to any right that is established in the united states constitution
a member of congress swears to support the constitution of the united states
and if he sees a right established by that constitution which needs specific legislative protection
can he clear his oath without giving that protection
let me ask you why many of us
who are opposed to slavery upon principle
give our acquiescence to a fugitive slave law
why do we hold ourselves under obligations to pass such a law
and abide by it when passed
because the constitution makes provision that the owners of slaves shall have the right to reclaim them
it gives the right to reclaim slaves and that right is
as judge douglas says
a barren right
unless there is legislation that will enforce it
the mere declaration
no person held to service or labour in one state
under the laws thereof
escaping into another
in consequence of any law or regulation therein
be discharged from such service or labour
but shall be delivered up on claim of the party to whom such service or labour may be due
is powerless without specific legislation to enforce it
on what ground would a member of congress who is opposed to slavery in the abstract
vote for a fugitive law
as i would deem it my duty to do
because there is a constitutional right which needs legislation to enforce it
although it is distasteful to me
i have sworn to support the constitution and
having so sworn
i cannot conceive that i do support it if i withhold from that right any necessary legislation to make it practical
and if that is true in regard to a fugitive slave law
is the right to have fugitive slaves reclaimed any better fixed in the constitution than the right to hold slaves in the territories
for this decision is a just exposition of the constitution
as judge douglas thinks
is the one right any better than the other
if i wished to refuse to give legislative support to slave property in the territories
if a member of congress
i could not do it
holding the view that the constitution establishes that right
if i did it at all
it would be because i deny that this decision properly construes the constitution
but if i acknowledge with judge douglas that this decision properly construes the constitution
i cannot conceive that i would be less than a perjured man if i should refuse in congress to give such protection to that property as in its nature it needed
from lincoln's reply to judge douglas at charleston
september 18
1858 judge douglas has said to you that he has not been able to get from me an answer to the question whether i am in favour of negro citizenship
so far as i know
the judge never asked me the question before
he shall have no occasion ever to ask it again
for i tell him very frankly that i am not in favour of negro citizenship
now my opinion is
that the different states have the power to make a negro a citizen under the constitution of the united states
if they choose
the dred scott decision decides that they have not that power
if the state of illinois had that power
i should be opposed to the exercise of it
that is all i have to say about it
judge douglas has told me that he heard my speeches north and my speeches south
and there was a very different cast of sentiment in the speeches made at the different points
i will not charge upon judge douglas that he wilfully misrepresents me
but i call upon every fair minded man to take these speeches and read them
and i dare him to point out any difference between my speeches north and south
while i am here
perhaps i ought to say a word
if i have the time
in regard to the latter portion of the judge's speech
which was a sort of declamation in reference to my having said that i entertained the belief that this government would not endure
half slave and half free
i have said so
and i did not say it without what seemed to me good reasons
it perhaps would require more time than i have now to set forth those reasons in detail but let me ask you a few questions
have we ever had any peace on this slavery question
when are we to have peace upon it if it is kept in the position it now occupies
how are we ever to have peace upon it
that is an important question
to be sure
if we will all stop and allow judge douglas and his friends to march on in their present career until they plant the institution all over the nation
here and wherever else our flag waves
and we acquiesce in it
there will be peace
but let me ask judge douglas how he is going to get the people to do that
they have been wrangling over this question for forty years
this was the cause of the agitation resulting in the missouri compromise this produced the troubles at the annexation of texas
in the acquisition of the territory acquired in the mexican war
this was the trouble quieted by the compromise of 1850
when it was settled for ever
as both the great political parties declared in their national conventions
that for ever turned out to be just four years
when judge douglas himself reopened it
when is it likely to come to an end
he introduced the nebraska bill in 1854
to put another end to the slavery agitation
he promised that it would finish it all up immediately
and he has never made a speech since
until he got into a quarrel with the president about the lecompton constitution
in which he has not declared that we are just at the end of the slavery agitation
but in one speech
i think last winter
he did say that he didn't quite see when the end of the slavery agitation would come
now he tells us again that it is all over
and the people of kansas have voted down the lecompton constitution
how is it over
that was only one of the attempts to put an end to the slavery agitation
one of these final settlements
is kansas in the union
has she formed a constitution that she is likely to come in under
is not the slavery agitation still an open question in that territory
if kansas should sink to day
and leave a great vacant space in the earth's surface
this vexed question would still be among us
i say
there is no way of putting an end to the slavery agitation amongst us
but to put it back upon the basis where our fathers placed it no way but to keep it out of our new territories
to restrict it for ever to the old states where it now exists
then the public mind will rest in the belief that it is in the course of ultimate extinction
that is one way of putting an end to the slavery agitation
the other way is for us to surrender
and let judge douglas and his friends have their way
and plant slavery over all the states
cease speaking of it as in any way a wrong regard slavery as one of the common matters of property
and speak of our negroes as we do of our horse and cattle
from lincoln's reply to judge douglas at galesburg
october 7
the judge has alluded to the declaration of independence
and insisted that negroes are not included in that declaration and that it is a slander on the framers of that instrument to suppose that negroes were meant therein and he asks you
is it possible to believe that mr
who penned that immortal paper
could have supposed himself applying the language of that instrument to the negro race
and yet held a portion of that race in slavery
would he not at once have freed them
i only have to remark upon this part of his speech and that too
very briefly
for i shall not detain myself or you upon that point for any great length of time
that i believe the entire records of the world
from the date of the declaration of independence up to within three years ago
may be searched in vain for one single affirmation from one single man
that the negro was not included in the declaration of independence i think i may defy judge douglas to show that he ever said so
that washington ever said so
that any president ever said so
that any member of congress ever said so
or that any living man upon the whole earth ever said so
until the necessities of the present policy of the democratic party in regard to slavery had to invent that affirmation
and i will remind judge douglas and this audience
that while mr
jefferson was the owner of slaves
as undoubtedly he was
in speaking on this very subject
he used the strong language that he trembled for his country when he remembered that god was just and i will offer the highest premium in my power to judge douglas if he will show that he
in all his life
ever uttered a sentiment at all akin to that of jefferson
i want to call to the judge's attention an attack he made upon me in the first one of these debates
in order to fix extreme abolitionism upon me
judge douglas read a set of resolutions which he declared had been passed by a republican state convention
in october 1854
held at springfield
and he declared that i had taken a part in that convention
it turned out that although a few men calling themselves an anti nebraska state convention had sat at springfield about that time
yet neither did i take any part in it
nor did it pass the resolutions or any such resolutions as judge douglas read
so apparent had it become that the resolutions that he read had not been passed at springfield at all
nor by any state convention in which i had taken part
that seven days later at freeport
judge douglas declared that he had been misled
and promised
that when he went to springfield he would investigate the matter
i have waited as i think a sufficient time for the report of that investigation
a fraud
an absolute forgery
was committed
and the perpetration of it was traced to the three
and douglas
whether it can be narrowed in any way
so as to exonerate any one of them
is what judge douglas's report would probably show
the main object of that forgery at that time was to beat yates and elect harris to congress
and that object was known to be exceedingly dear to judge douglas at that time
the fraud having been apparently successful upon that occasion
both harris and douglas have more than once since then been attempting to put it to new uses
as the fisherman's wife
whose drowned husband was brought home with his body full of eels
when she was asked what was to be done with him
take out the eels and set him again
 so harris and douglas have shown a disposition to take the eels out of that stale fraud by which they gained harris's election
and set the fraud again
more than once
and now that it has been discovered publicly to be a fraud
we find that judge douglas manifests no surprise at all
but meanwhile the three are agreed that each is a most honourable man
notes for speeches
october 1858 suppose it is true that the negro is inferior to the white in the gifts of nature is it not the exact reverse of justice that the white should for that reason take from the negro any part of the little which he has had given him
give to him that is needy is the christian rule of charity but take from him that is needy is the rule of slavery
the sum of pro slavery theology seems to be this
slavery is not universally right
nor yet universally wrong it is better for some people to be slaves and
in such cases
it is the will of god that they be such
certainly there is no contending against the will of god but still there is some difficulty in ascertaining and applying it to particular cases
for instance
we will suppose the rev
ross has a slave named sambo
and the question is
is it the will of god that sambo shall remain a slave
or be set free
the almighty gives no audible answer to the question
and his revelation
the bible
gives none or at most none but such as admits of a squabble as to its meaning no one thinks of asking sambo's opinion on it
so at last it comes to this
that dr
ross is to decide the question and while he considers it
he sits in the shade
with gloves on his hands
and subsists on the bread that sambo is earning in the burning sun
if he decides that god wills sambo to continue a slave
he thereby retains his own comfortable position but if he decides that god wills sambo to be free
he thereby has to walk out of the shade
throw off his gloves
and delve for his own bread
will dr
ross be actuated by the perfect impartiality which has ever been considered most favourable to correct decisions
we have in this nation the element of domestic slavery
it is a matter of absolute certainty that it is a disturbing element
it is the opinion of all the great men who have expressed an opinion upon it
that it is a dangerous element
we keep up a controversy in regard to it
that controversy necessarily springs from difference of opinion
and if we can learn exactly can reduce to the lowest elements what that difference of opinion is
we perhaps shall be better prepared for discussing the different systems of policy that we would propose in regard to that disturbing element
i suggest that the difference of opinion
reduced to its lowest terms
is no other than the difference between the men who think slavery a wrong and those who do not think it wrong
the republican party think it wrong we think it is a moral
a social
and a political wrong
we think it is a wrong not confining itself merely to the persons or the states where it exists
but that it is a wrong which in its tendency
to say the least
affects the existence of the whole nation
because we think it wrong
we propose a course of policy that shall deal with it as a wrong
we deal with it as with any other wrong
in so far as we can prevent its growing any larger
and so deal with it that in the run of time there may be some promise of an end to it we have a due regard to the actual presence of it amongst us
and the difficulties of getting rid of it in any satisfactory way
and all the constitutional obligations thrown about it
i suppose that in reference both to its actual existence in the nation
and to our constitutional obligations
we have no right at all to disturb it in the states where it exists
and we profess that we have no more inclination to disturb it than we have the right to do it
we go further than that
we don't propose to disturb it where
in one instance
we think the constitution would permit us
we think the constitution would permit us to disturb it in the district of columbia
still we do not propose to do that
unless it should be in terms which i don't suppose the nation is very likely soon to agree to the terms of making the emancipation gradual and compensating the unwilling owners
where we suppose we have the constitutional right
we restrain ourselves in reference to the actual existence of the institution and the difficulties thrown about it
we also oppose it as an evil so far as it seeks to spread itself
we insist on the policy that shall restrict it to its present limits
we don't suppose that in doing this we violate anything due to the actual presence of the institution
or anything due to the constitutional guaranties thrown around it
we oppose the dred scott decision in a certain way
upon which i ought perhaps to address you in a few words
we do not propose that when dred scott has been decided to be a slave by the court
as a mob
will decide him to be free
we do not propose that
when any other one
or one thousand
shall be decided by that court to be slaves
we will in any violent way disturb the rights of property thus settled but we nevertheless do oppose that decision as a political rule
which shall be binding on the voter to vote for nobody who thinks it wrong
which shall be binding on the members of congress or the president to favour no measure that does not actually concur with the principles of that decision
we do not propose to be bound by it as a political rule in that way
because we think it lays the foundation not merely of enlarging and spreading out what we consider an evil
but it lays the foundation for spreading that evil into the states themselves
we propose so resisting it as to have it reversed if we can
and a new judicial rule established upon this subject
i will add this
that if there be any man who does not believe that slavery is wrong in the three aspects which i have mentioned
or in any one of them
that man is misplaced and ought to leave us
on the other hand
if there be any man in the republican party who is impatient over the necessity springing from its actual presence
and is impatient of the constitutional guaranties thrown around it
and would act in disregard of these
he too is misplaced
standing with us
he will find his place somewhere else for we have a due regard
so far as we are capable of understanding them
for all these things
as well as i can give it
is a plain statement of our principles in all their enormity
i will say now that there is a sentiment in the country contrary to me a sentiment which holds that slavery is not wrong
and therefore goes for the policy that does not propose dealing with it as a wrong
that policy is the democratic policy
and that sentiment is the democratic sentiment
if there be a doubt in the mind of any one of this vast audience that this is really the central idea of the democratic party
in relation to this subject
i ask him to bear with me while i state a few things tending
as i think
to prove that proposition
in the first place
the leading man
i think i may do my friend judge douglas the honour of calling him such
advocating the present democratic policy
never himself says it is wrong
he has the high distinction
so far as i know
of never having said slavery is either right or wrong
almost everybody else says one or the other
but the judge never does
if there be a man in the democratic party who thinks it is wrong
and yet clings to that party
i suggest to him in the first place that his leader don't talk as he does
for he never says that it is wrong
in the second place
i suggest to him that if he will examine the policy proposed to be carried forward
he will find that he carefully excludes the idea that there is anything wrong in it
if you will examine the arguments that are made on it
you will find that every one carefully excludes the idea that there is anything wrong in slavery
perhaps that democrat who says he is as much opposed to slavery as i am will tell me that i am wrong about this
i wish him to examine his own course in regard to this matter a moment
and then see if his opinion will not be changed a little
you say it is wrong but don't you constantly object to anybody else saying so
do you not constantly argue that this is not the right place to oppose it
you say it must not be opposed in the free states
because slavery is not there it must not be opposed in the slave states
because it is there it must not be opposed in politics
because that will make a fuss it must not be opposed in the pulpit
because it is not religion
then where is the place to oppose it
there is no suitable place to oppose it
there is no plan in the country to oppose this evil overspreading the continent
which you say yourself is coming
frank blair and gratz brown tried to get up a system of gradual emancipation in missouri
had an election in august
and got beat and you
threw up your hat and hallooed
hurrah for democracy
so i say again
that in regard to the arguments that are made
when judge douglas says he don't care whether slavery is voted up or voted down
whether he means that as an individual expression of sentiment
or only as a sort of statement of his views on national policy
it is alike true to say that he can thus argue logically if he don't see anything wrong in it but he cannot say so logically if he admits that slavery is wrong
he cannot say that he would as soon see a wrong voted up as voted down
when judge douglas says that whoever or whatever community wants slaves
they have a right to have them
he is perfectly logical if there is nothing wrong in the institution but if you admit that it is wrong
he cannot logically say that anybody has a right to do wrong
when he says that slave property and horse and hog property are alike to be allowed to go into the territories
upon the principles of equality
he is reasoning truly if there is no difference between them as property but if the one is property
held rightfully
and the other is wrong
then there is no equality between the right and wrong so that
turn it in any way you can
in all the arguments sustaining the democratic policy
and in that policy itself
there is a careful
studied exclusion of the idea that there is anything wrong in slavery
let us understand this
i am not
just here
trying to prove that we are right and they are wrong
i have been stating where we and they stand
and trying to show what is the real difference between us and i now say that whenever we can get the question distinctly stated
can get all these men who believe that slavery is in some of these respects wrong
to stand and act with us in treating it as a wrong
and not till then
i think
will we in some way come to an end of this slavery agitation
lincoln's reply to judge douglas in the seventh and last debate
october 15
but is it true that all the difficulty and agitation we have in regard to this institution of slavery springs from office seeking
from the mere ambition of politicians
is that the truth
how many times have we had danger from this question
go back to the day of the missouri compromise
go back to the nullification question
at the bottom of which lay this same slavery question
go back to the time of the annexation of texas
go back to the troubles that led to the compromise of 1850
you will find that every time
with the single exception of the nullification question
they sprung from an endeavour to spread this institution
there never was a party in the history of this country
and there probably never will be
of sufficient strength to disturb the general peace of the country
parties themselves may be divided and quarrel on minor questions
yet it extends not beyond the parties themselves
but does not this question make a disturbance outside of political circles
does it not enter into the churches and rend them asunder
what divided the great methodist church into two parts
north and south
what has raised this constant disturbance in every presbyterian general assembly that meets
what disturbed the unitarian church in this very city two years ago
what has jarred and shaken the great american tract society recently
not yet splitting it
but sure to divide it in the end
is it not this same mighty
deep seated power
that somehow operates on the minds of men
exciting and stirring them up in every avenue of society
in politics
in religion
in literature
in morals
in all the manifold relations of life
is this the work of politicians
is that irresistible power which for fifty years has shaken the government and agitated the people
to be stilled and subdued by pretending that it is an exceedingly simple thing
and we ought not to talk about it
if you will get everybody else to stop talking about it
i assure you that i will quit before they have half done so
but where is the philosophy or statesmanship which assumes that you can quiet that disturbing element in our society
which has disturbed us for more than half a century
which has been the only serious danger that has threatened our institutions
i say where is the philosophy or the statesmanship
based on the assumption that we are to quit talking about it
and that the public mind is all at once to cease being agitated by it
yet this is the policy here in the north that douglas is advocating
that we are to care nothing about it
i ask you if it is not a false philosophy
is it not a false statesmanship that undertakes to build up a system of policy upon the basis of caring nothing about the very thing that everybody does care the most about
a thing which all experience has shown we care a very great deal about
the judge alludes very often in the course of his remarks to the exclusive right which the states have to decide the whole thing for themselves
i agree with him very readily
our controversy with him is in regard to the new territories
we agree that when states come in as states they have the right and power to do as they please
we profess constantly that we have no more inclination than belief in the power of the government to disturb it yet we are driven constantly to defend ourselves from the assumption that we are warring upon the rights of the states
what i insist upon is
that the new territories shall be kept free from it while in the territorial condition
these are false issues
upon which judge douglas has tried to force the controversy
the real issue in this controversy the one dressing upon every mind is the sentiment on the part of one class that looks upon the institution of slavery as a wrong
and of another class that does not look upon it as a wrong
the sentiment that contemplates the institution of slavery in this country as a wrong is the sentiment of the republican party
it is the sentiment around which all their actions
all their arguments
circle from which all their propositions radiate
they look upon it as being a moral
and political wrong and while they contemplate it as such
they nevertheless have due regard for its actual existence among us
and the difficulties of getting rid of it in any satisfactory way
and to all the constitutional obligations thrown about it
having a due regard for these
they desire a policy in regard to it that looks to its not creating any more danger
they insist that it
as far as may be
be treated as a wrong and one of the methods of treating it as a wrong is to make provision that it shall grow no larger
they also desire a policy that looks to a peaceful end of slavery some time
as being a wrong
these are the views they entertain in regard to it
as i understand them and all their sentiments
all their arguments and propositions are brought within this range
i have said
and i here repeat it
that if there be a man amongst us who does not think that the institution of slavery is wrong in any one of the aspects of which i have spoken
he is misplaced
and ought not to be with us
and if there be a man amongst us who is so impatient of it as a wrong as to disregard its actual presence among us
and the difficulty of getting rid of it suddenly in a satisfactory way
and to disregard the constitutional obligations thrown about it
that man is misplaced if he is on our platform
we disclaim sympathy with him in practical action
he is not placed properly with us
on this subject of treating it as a wrong and limiting its spread
let me say a word
has anything ever threatened the existence of this union save and except this very institution of slavery
what is it that we hold most dear amongst us
our own liberty and prosperity
what has ever threatened our liberty and prosperity save and except this institution of slavery
if this is true
how do you propose to improve the condition of things by enlarging slavery
by spreading it out and making it bigger
you may have a wen or a cancer upon your person
and not be able to cut it out lest you bleed to death but surely it is no way to cure it
to engraft it and spread it over your whole body
that is no proper way of treating what you regard as a wrong
you see this peaceful way of dealing with it as a wrong
restricting the spread of it
and not allowing it to go into new countries where it has not already existed
that is the peaceful way the old fashioned way the way in which the fathers themselves set us the example
on the other hand
i have said there is a sentiment which treats it as not being wrong
that is the democratic sentiment of this day
i do not mean to say that every man who stands within that range positively asserts that it is right
that class will include all who positively assert that it is right
and all who
like judge douglas
treat it as indifferent
and do not say it is either right or wrong
these two classes of men fall within the general class of those who do not look upon it as a wrong
and if there be among you anybody who supposes that he
as a democrat
can consider himself as much opposed to slavery as anybody
i would like to reason with him
you never treat it as a wrong
what other thing that you consider a wrong do you deal with as you deal with that
perhaps you say it is wrong
but your leader never does
and you quarrel with anybody who says it is wrong
although you pretend to say so yourself
you can find no fit place to deal with it as a wrong
you must not say anything about it in the free states
because it is not here
you must not say anything about it in the slave states
because it is there
you must not say anything about it in the pulpit
because that is religion
and has nothing to do with it
you must not say anything about it in politics
because that will disturb the security of my place
there is no place to talk about it as being a wrong
although you say yourself it is a wrong
you will screw yourself up to the belief that if the people of the slave states should adopt a system of gradual emancipation on the slavery question
you would be in favour of it
you would be in favour of it
you say that is getting it in the right place
and you would be glad to see it succeed
but you are deceiving yourself
you all know that frank blair and gratz brown
down there in st
undertook to introduce that system in missouri
they fought as valiantly as they could for the system of gradual emancipation
which you pretend you would be glad to see succeed
now i will bring you to the test
after a hard fight they were beaten and when the news came over here
you threw up your hats and hurrahed for democracy
more than that take all the argument made in favour of the system you have proposed
and it carefully excludes the idea that there is anything wrong in the institution of slavery
the arguments to sustain that policy carefully exclude it
even here to day
you heard judge douglas quarrel with me
because i uttered a wish that it might sometime come to an end
although henry clay could say he wished every slave in the united states was in the country of his ancestors
i am denounced by those who pretend to respect henry clay
for uttering a wish that it might sometime
in some peaceful way
come to an end
the democratic policy in regard to that institution will not tolerate the merest breath
the slightest hint
of the least degree of wrong about it
try it by some of judge douglas's arguments
he says he don't care whether it is voted up or voted down in the territories
i do not care myself in dealing with that expression whether it is intended to be expressive of his individual sentiments on the subject or only of the national policy he desires to have established
but no man can logically say it who does see a wrong in it because no man can logically say he don't care whether a wrong is voted up or voted down
any man can say that who does not see anything wrong in slavery
but if it is a wrong
he cannot say that people have a right to do wrong
he says that
upon the score of equality
slaves should be allowed to go into a new territory like other property
this is strictly logical if there is no difference between it and other property
but if you insist that one is wrong and the other right
there is no use to institute a comparison between right and wrong
the democratic policy everywhere carefully excludes the idea that there is anything wrong in it
that is the real issue
that is the issue that will continue in this country when these poor tongues of judge douglas and myself shall be silent
it is the eternal struggle between these two principles right and wrong throughout the world
they are the two principles that have stood face to face from the beginning of time
and will ever continue to struggle
the one is the common right of humanity
and the other the divine right of kings
it is the same principle in whatever shape it develops itself
it is the same spirit that says
you toil and work and earn bread
and i'll eat it
no matter in what shape it comes
whether from the mouth of a king
who seeks to bestride the people of his own nation and live by the fruit of their labour
or from one race of men as an apology for enslaving another race
it is the same tyrannical principle
whenever the issue can be distinctly made
and all extraneous matter thrown out
so that men can fairly see the real difference between the parties
this controversy will soon be settled
and it will be done peaceably
there will be no war
no violence
it will be placed again where the wisest and best men of the world placed it
from a speech at columbus
on the slave trade
popular sovereignty
september 16
the republican party
as i understand its principles and policy
believes that there is great danger of the institution of slavery being spread out and extended
until it is ultimately made alike lawful in all the states of this union so believing
to prevent that incidental and ultimate consummation is the original and chief purpose of the republican organization
i say chief purpose of the republican organization for it is certainly true that if the national house shall fall into the hands of the republicans
they will have to attend to all the matters of national house keeping as well as this
the chief and real purpose of the republican party is eminently conservative
it proposes nothing save and except to restore this government to its original tone in regard to this element of slavery
and there to maintain it
looking for no further change in reference to it than that which the original framers of the government themselves expected and looked forward to
the chief danger to this purpose of the republican party is not just now the revival of the african slave trade
or the passage of a congressional slave code
but the most imminent danger that now threatens that purpose is that insidious douglas popular sovereignty
this is the miner and sapper
while it does not propose to revive the african slave trade
nor to pass a slave code
nor to make a second dred scott decision
it is preparing us for the onslaught and charge of these ultimate enemies when they shall be ready to come on
and the word of command for them to advance shall be given
i say this douglas popular sovereignty for there is a broad distinction
as i now understand it
between that article and a genuine popular sovereignty
i believe there is a genuine popular sovereignty
i think a definition of genuine popular sovereignty in the abstract would be about this
that each man shall do precisely as he pleases with himself
and with all those things which exclusively concern him
applied to governments
this principle would be
that a general government shall do all those things which pertain to it and all the local governments shall do precisely as they please in respect to those matters which exclusively concern them
i understand that this government of the united states under which we live
is based upon this principle and i am misunderstood if it is supposed that i have any war to make upon that principle
what is judge douglas's popular sovereignty
it is
as a principle
no other than that if one man chooses to make a slave of another man
neither that other man nor anybody else has a right to object
applied in government
as he seeks to apply it
it is this
in a new territory into which a few people are beginning to enter for the purpose of making their homes
they choose to either exclude slavery from their limits or to establish it there
however one or the other may affect the persons to be enslaved
or the infinitely greater number of persons who are afterward to inhabit that territory
or the other members of the families of communities of which they are but an incipient member
or the general head of the family of states as parent of all
however their action may affect one or the other of these
there is no power or right to interfere
that is douglas popular sovereignty applied
i cannot but express my gratitude that this true view of this element of discord among us
as i believe it is
is attracting more and more attention
i do not believe that governor seward uttered that sentiment because i had done so before
but because he reflected upon this subject
and saw the truth of it
nor do i believe
because governor seward or i uttered it
that mr
hickman of pennsylvania
in different language
since that time
has declared his belief in the utter antagonism which exists between the principles of liberty and slavery
you see we are multiplying
while i am speaking of hickman
let me say
i know but little about him
i have never seen him
and know scarcely anything about the man but i will say this much about him
of all the anti lecompton democracy that have been brought to my notice
he alone has the true
genuine ring of the metal
judge douglas
proceeds to assume
without proving it
that slavery is one of those little
trivial matters which are of just about as much consequence as the question would be to me
whether my neighbour should raise horned cattle or plant tobacco that there is no moral question about it
but that it is altogether a matter of dollars and cents that when a new territory is opened for settlement
the first man who goes into it may plant there a thing which
like the canada thistle or some other of those pests of the soil
cannot be dug out by the millions of men who will come thereafter that it is one of those little things that is so trivial in its nature that it has no effect upon anybody save the few men who first plant upon the soil that it is not a thing which in any way affects the family of communities composing these states
nor any way endangers the general government
judge douglas ignores altogether the very well known fact that we have never had a serious menace to our political existence except it sprang from this thing
which he chooses to regard as only upon a par with onions and potatoes
did you ever
five years ago
hear of anybody in the world saying that the negro had no share in the declaration of national independence that it did not mean negroes at all and when all men were spoken of
negroes were not included
then i suppose that all now express the belief that the declaration of independence never did mean negroes
i call upon one of them to say that he said it five years ago
if you think that now
and did not think it then
the next thing that strikes me is to remark that there has been a change wrought in you
and a very significant change it is
being no less than changing the negro
in your estimation
from the rank of a man to that of a brute
is not this change wrought in your minds a very important change
public opinion in this country is everything
in a nation like ours this popular sovereignty and squatter sovereignty have already wrought a change in the public mind to the extent i have stated
if you are opposed to slavery honestly
i ask you to note that fact the popular sovereignty of judge douglas
and the like of which is to follow
to be plastered on
layer after layer
until very soon you are prepared to deal with the negro everywhere as with the brute
if public sentiment has not been debauched already to this point
a new turn of the screw in that direction is all that is wanting and this is constantly being done by the teachers of this insidious popular sovereignty
you need but one or two turns further
until your minds
now ripening under these teachings
will be ready for all these things
and you will receive and support or submit to the slave trade
revived with all its horrors
a slave code enforced in our territories
and a new dred scott decision to bring slavery up into the very heart of the free north
i ask attention to the fact that in a pre eminent degree these popular sovereigns are at this work
blowing out the moral lights around us teaching that the negro is no longer a man
but a brute that the declaration has nothing to do with him that he ranks with the crocodile and the reptile that man with body and soul is a matter of dollars and cents
i suggest to this portion of the ohio republicans
or democrats
if there be any present
the serious consideration of this fact
that there is now going on among you a steady process of debauching public opinion on this subject
with this
my friends
i bid you adieu
from a speech at cincinnati
on the intentions of black republicans
the relation of labour and capital
september 17
i say
in the first place to the kentuckians that i am what they call
as i understand it
a black republican
i think slavery is wrong
morally and politically
i desire that it should be no further spread in these united states
and i should not object if it should gradually terminate in the whole union
while i say this for myself
i say to you
that i understand you differ radically with me upon this proposition that you believe slavery is a good thing that slavery is right that it ought to be extended and perpetuated in this union
there being this broad difference between us
i do not pretend
in addressing myself to you
to attempt proselyting you
that would be a vain effort
i do not enter upon it
i only propose to try to show you that you ought to nominate for the next presidency
at charleston
my distinguished friend
judge douglas
in all that
there is no real difference between you and him i understand he is as sincerely for you
and more wisely for you than you are for yourselves
i will try to demonstrate that proposition
in kentucky perhaps in many of the slave states certainly you are trying to establish the rightfulness of slavery by reference to the bible
you are trying to show that slavery existed in the bible times by divine ordinance
douglas is wiser than you
for your own benefit
upon that subject
douglas knows that whenever you establish that slavery was right by the bible
it will occur that that slavery was the slavery of the white man
of men without reference to colour
and he knows very well that you may entertain that idea in kentucky as much as you please
but you will never win any northern support upon it
he makes a wiser argument for you
he makes the argument that the slavery of the black man the slavery of the man who has a skin of a different colour from your own is right
he thereby brings to your support northern voters
who could not for a moment be brought by your own argument of the bible right of slavery
at memphis he judge douglas declared that in all contests between the negro and the white man
he was for the white man
but that in all questions between the negro and the crocodile
he was for the negro
he did not make that declaration accidentally
he made it a great many times
the first inference seems to be that if you do not enslave the negro
you are wronging the white man in some way or other and that whoever is opposed to the negro being enslaved is in some way or other against the white man
is not that a falsehood
if there was a necessary conflict between the white man and the negro
i should be for the white man as much as judge douglas but i say there is no such necessary conflict
i say there is room enough for us all to be free
and that it not only does not wrong the white man that the negro should be free
but it positively wrongs the mass of the white men that the negro should be enslaved
that the mass of white men are really injured by the effects of slave labour in the vicinity of the fields of their own labour
there is one other thing that i will say to you in this relation
it is but my opinion i give it to you without a fee
it is my opinion that it is for you to take him or be defeated and that if you do take him you may be beaten
you will surely be beaten if you do not take him
the republicans and others forming the opposition of the country
intend to stand by our guns
to be patient and firm
and in the long run to beat you
whether you take him or not
we know that before we fairly beat you
we have to beat you both together
we know that you are all of a feather
and that we have to beat you all together
and we expect to do it
we don't intend to be very impatient about it
we mean to be as deliberate and calm about it as it is possible to be
but as firm and resolved as it is possible for men to be
when we do as we say
beat you
you perhaps want to know what we will do with you
i will tell you
so far as i am authorized to speak for the opposition
what we mean to do with you
we mean to treat you
as near as we possibly can
as washington
and madison treated you
we mean to leave you alone
and in no way to interfere with your institution to abide by all and every compromise of the constitution
in a word
coming back to the original proposition
to treat you
so far as degenerate men if we have degenerated may
according to the example of those noble fathers washington
and madison
we mean to remember that you are as good as we that there is no difference between us other than the difference of circumstances
we mean to recognize and bear in mind always
that you have as good hearts in your bosoms as other people
or as we claim to have
and to treat you accordingly
we mean to marry your girls when we have a chance the white ones
i mean
and i have the honour to inform you that i once did have a chance in that way
i have told you what we mean to do
i want to know
when that thing takes place
what do you mean to do
i often hear it intimated that you mean to divide the union whenever a republican
or anything like it
is elected president of the united states
a voice
that is so
that is so
one of them says i wonder if he is a kentuckian
a voice
he is a douglas man
well
i want to know what you are going to do with your half of it
are you going to split the ohio down through
and push your half off a piece
or are you going to keep it right alongside of us outrageous fellows
or are you going to build up a wall some way between your country and ours
by which that movable property of yours can't come over here any more
to the danger of your losing it
do you think you can better yourselves on that subject by leaving us here under no obligation whatever to return those specimens of your movable property that come hither
you have divided the union because we would not do right with you
as you think
upon that subject when we cease to be under obligation to do anything for you
how much better off do you think you will be
will you make war upon us and kill us all
i think you are as gallant and as brave men as live that you can fight as bravely in a good cause
man for man
as any other people living that you have shown yourselves capable of this upon various occasions but man for man
you are not better than we are
and there are not so many of you as there are of us
you will never make much of a hand at whipping us
if we were fewer in numbers than you
i think that you could whip us if we were equal it would likely be a drawn battle but being inferior in numbers
you will make nothing by attempting to master us
labour is the great source from which nearly all
if not all
human comforts and necessities are drawn
there is a difference in opinion about the elements of labour in society
some men assume that there is a necessary connection between capital and labour
and that connection draws within it the whole of the labour of the community
they assume that nobody works unless capital excites them to work
they begin next to consider what is the best way
they say there are but two ways
one is to hire men and to allure them to labour by their consent the other is to buy the men
and drive them to it
and that is slavery
having assumed that
they proceed to discuss the question of whether the labourers themselves are better off in the condition of slaves or of hired labourers
and they usually decide that they are better off in the condition of slaves
in the first place
i say the whole thing is a mistake
that there is a certain relation between capital and labour
i admit
that it does exist
and rightfully exist
i think is true
that men who are industrious and sober and honest in the pursuit of their own interests should after a while accumulate capital
and after that should be allowed to enjoy it in peace
and also if they should choose
when they have accumulated it
to use it to save themselves from actual labour
and hire other people to labour for them
is right
in doing so
they do not wrong the man they employ
for they find men who have not their own land to work upon
or shops to work in
and who are benefited by working for others
hired labourers
receiving their capital for it
thus a few men that own capital hire a few others
and these establish the relation of capital and labour rightfully a relation of which i make no complaint
but i insist that that relation
after all
does not embrace more than one eighth of the labour of the country
there are a plenty of men in the slave states that are altogether good enough for me
to be either president or vice president
provided they will profess their sympathy with our purpose
and will place themselves on such ground that our men upon principle can vote for them
there are scores of them good men in their character for intelligence
for talent and integrity
if such an one will place himself upon the right ground
i am for his occupying one place upon the next republican or opposition ticket
i will go heartily for him
but unless he does so place himself
i think it is perfect nonsense to attempt to bring about a union upon any other basis that if a union be made
the elements will so scatter that there can be no success for such a ticket
the good old maxims of the bible are applicable
and truly applicable
to human affairs and in this
as in other things
we may say that he who is not for us is against us he who gathereth not with us
i should be glad to have some of the many good and able and noble men of the south place themselves where we can confer upon them the high honour of an election upon one or the other end of our ticket
it would do my soul good to do that thing
it would enable us to teach them that inasmuch as we select one of their own number to carry out our principles
we are free from the charge that we mean more than we say
from a letter to j
december 20
1859 i was born february 12
in hardin county
my parents were both born in virginia
of undistinguished families second families
perhaps i should say
my mother
who died in my tenth year
was of a family of the name of hanks
some of whom now reside in adams
and others in macon county
my paternal grandfather
abraham lincoln
emigrated from rockingham county
to kentucky about 1781 or 1782
where a year or two later he was killed by the indians
not in battle
but by stealth
when he was labouring to open a farm in the forest
his ancestors
who were quakers
went to virginia from berks county
an effort to identify them with the new england family of the same name ended in nothing more definite than a similarity of christian names in both families
such as enoch
and the like
my father
at the death of his father
was but six years of age
and he grew up literally without education
he removed from kentucky to what is now spencer county
in my eighth year
we reached our new home about the time the state came into the union
it was a wild region
with many bears and other wild animals still in the woods
there i grew up
there were some schools
so called
but no qualification was ever required of a teacher beyond readin
and cipherin' to the rule of three
if a straggler supposed to understand latin happened to sojourn in the neighbourhood
he was looked upon as a wizard
there was absolutely nothing to excite ambition for education
of course
when i came of age i did not know much
i could read
and cipher to the rule of three
but that was all
i have not been to school since
the little advance i now have upon this store of education i have picked up from time to time under the pressure of necessity
i was raised to farm work
which i continued till i was twenty two
at twenty one i came to illinois
macon county
then i got to new salem
at that time in sangamon
now in menard county
where i remained a year as a sort of clerk in a store
then came the black hawk war and i was elected a captain of volunteers
a success which gave me more pleasure than any i have had since
i went the campaign
was elated
ran for the legislature the same year 1832
and was beaten the only time i ever have been beaten by the people
the next and three succeeding biennial elections i was elected to the legislature
i was not a candidate afterward
during this legislative period i had studied law
and removed to springfield to practise it
in 1846 i was once elected to the lower house of congress
was not a candidate for re election
from 1849 to 1854
both inclusive
practised law more assiduously than ever before
always a whig in politics and generally on the whig electoral tickets
making active canvasses
i was losing interest in politics when the repeal of the missouri compromise aroused me again
what i have done since then is pretty well known
if any personal description of me is thought desirable
it may be said i am
in height
six feet four inches
nearly lean in flesh
weighing on an average one hundred and eighty pounds dark complexion
with coarse black hair and gray eyes
no other marks or brands recollected

let me guard a little against being misunderstood
i do not mean to say we are bound to follow implicitly in whatever our fathers did
to do so
would be to discard all the lights of current experience to reject all progress
all improvement
what i do say is
that if we would supplant the opinions and policy of our fathers in any case
we should do so on evidence so conclusive
and argument so clear
that even their great authority
fairly considered and weighed
cannot stand and most surely not in a case whereof we ourselves declare they understood the question better than we
if any man at this day sincerely believes that the proper division of local from federal authority
or any part of the constitution
forbids the federal government to control as to slavery in the federal territories
he is right to say so
and to enforce his position by all truthful evidence and fair argument he can
but he has no right to mislead others who have less access to history
and less leisure to study it
into the false belief that our fathers who framed the government under which we live were of the same opinion thus substituting falsehood and deception for truthful evidence and fair argument
if any man at this day sincerely believes our fathers who framed the government under which we live used and applied principles
in other cases
which ought to have led them to understand that a proper division of local from federal authority
or some part of the constitution
forbids the federal government to control as to slavery in the federal territories
he is right to say so
but he should
at the same time
have the responsibility of declaring that
in his opinion
he understands their principles better than they did themselves and especially should he not shirk the responsibility by asserting that they understood the question just as well and even better than we do now
but enough
let all who believe that our fathers who framed the government under which we live understood this question just as well
and even better than we do now
speak as they spoke
and act as they acted upon it
this is all republicans ask
all republicans desire
in relation to slavery
as those fathers marked it
so let it again be marked
as an evil not to be extended
but to be tolerated and protected only because of and so far as its actual presence among us makes that toleration and protection a necessity
let all the guaranties those fathers gave it be not grudgingly
but fully and fairly maintained
for this republicans contend
and with this
so far as i know or believe
they will be content
and now
if they would listen
as i suppose they will not
i would address a few words to the southern people
i would say to them
you consider yourselves a reasonable and a just people and i consider that in the general qualities of reason and justice you are not inferior to any other people
when you speak of us republicans
you do so only to denounce us as reptiles
at the best
as no better than outlaws
you will grant a hearing to pirates or murderers
but nothing like it to black republicans
in all your contentions with one another
each of you deems an unconditional condemnation of black republicanism as the first thing to be attended to
such condemnation of us seems to be an indispensable prerequisite license
so to speak among you to be admitted or permitted to speak at all
can you or not be prevailed upon to pause and to consider whether this is quite just to us
or even to yourselves
bring forward your charges and specifications
and then be patient long enough to hear us deny or justify
you say we are sectional
we deny it
that makes an issue and the burden of proof is upon you
you produce your proof and what is it
that our party has no existence in your section gets no votes in your section
the fact is substantially true but does it prove the issue
if it does
in case we should
without change of principle
begin to get votes in your section
we should thereby cease to be sectional
you cannot escape this conclusion and yet
are you willing to abide by it
if you are
you will probably soon find that we have ceased to be sectional
for we shall get votes in your section this very year
you will then begin to discover
as the truth plainly is
that your proof does not touch the issue
the fact that we get no votes in your section is a fact of your making
and not of ours
and if there be fault in that fact
that fault is primarily yours
and remains so until you show that we repel you by some wrong principle or practice
if we do repel you by any wrong principle or practice
the fault is ours but this brings you to where you ought to have started to a discussion of the right or wrong of our principle
if our principle
put in practice
would wrong your section for the benefit of ours
or for any other object
then our principle
and we with it
are sectional
and are justly opposed and denounced as such
meet us
on the question of whether our principle
put in practice
would wrong your section and so meet us as if it were possible that something may be said on our side
do you accept the challenge
then you really believe that the principle which our fathers who framed the government under which we live thought so clearly right as to adopt it
and indorse it again and again
upon their official oaths
is in fact so clearly wrong as to demand your condemnation without a moment's consideration
some of you delight to flaunt in our faces the warning against sectional parties given by washington in his farewell address
less than eight years before washington gave that warning he had
as president of the united states
approved and signed an act of congress enforcing the prohibition of slavery in the northwestern territory
which act embodied the policy of the government upon that subject up to and at the very moment he penned that warning and about one year after he penned it
he wrote lafayette that he considered that prohibition a wise measure
expressing in the same connection his hope that we should at some time have a confederacy of free states
bearing this in mind
and seeing that sectionalism has since arisen upon this same subject
is that warning a weapon in your hands against us
or in our hands against you
could washington himself speak
would he cast the blame of that sectionalism upon us
who sustain his policy
or upon you
who repudiate it
we respect that warning of washington
and we commend it to you
together with his example pointing to the right application of it
but you say you are conservative
eminently conservative
while we are revolutionary
or something of the sort
what is conservatism
is it not adherence to the old and tried
against the new and untried
we stick to
contend for
the identical old policy on the point in controversy which was adopted by our fathers who framed the government under which we live while you with one accord reject
and scout
and spit upon that old policy
and insist upon substituting something new
you disagree among yourselves as to what that substitute shall be
you are divided on new propositions and plans
but you are unanimous in rejecting and denouncing the old policy of the fathers
some of you are for reviving the foreign slave trade some for a congressional slave code for the territories some for congress forbidding the territories to prohibit slavery within their limits some for maintaining slavery in the territories through the judiciary some for the gur reat pur rinciple that if one man would enslave another
no third man should object
fantastically called popular sovereignty but never a man among you is in favour of federal prohibition of slavery in federal territories
according to the practice of our fathers who framed the government under which we live
not one of all your various plans can show a precedent or an advocate in the century within which our government originated
whether your claim for conservatism for yourselves
and your charge of destructiveness against us
are based on the most clear and stable foundations
you say we have made the slavery question more prominent than it formerly was
we deny it
we admit that it is more prominent
but we deny that we made it so
it was not we
but you
who discarded the old policy of the fathers
we resisted
and still resist
your innovation and thence comes the greater prominence of the question
would you have that question reduced to its former proportions
go back to that old policy
what has been will be again
under the same conditions
if you would have the peace of the old times
readopt the precepts and policy of the old times
you charge that we stir up insurrections among your slaves
we deny it and what is your proof
harper's ferry
john brown
john brown was no republican and you have failed to implicate a single republican in his harper's ferry enterprise
if any member of our party is guilty in that matter
you know it
or you do not know it
if you do know it
you are inexcusable for not designating the man and proving the fact
if you do not know it
you are inexcusable for asserting it
and especially for persisting in the assertion after you have tried and failed to make the proof
you need not be told that persisting in a charge which one does not know to be true is simply malicious slander
some of you admit that no republican designedly aided or encouraged the harper's ferry affair
but still insist that our doctrines and declarations necessarily lead to such results
we do not believe it
we know we hold no doctrine
and make no declaration
which were not held to and made by our fathers who framed the government under which we live
you never dealt fairly by us in relation to this affair
when it occurred
some important state elections were near at hand
and you were in evident glee with the belief that
by charging the blame upon us
you could get an advantage of us in those elections
the elections came
and your expectations were not quite fulfilled
every republican man knew that
as to himself at least
your charge was a slander
and he was not much inclined by it to cast his vote in your favour
republican doctrines and declarations are accompanied with a continual protest against any interference whatever with your slaves
or with you about your slaves
surely this does not encourage them to revolt
we do
in common with our fathers who framed the government under which we live
declare our belief that slavery is wrong but the slaves do not hear us declare even this
for anything we say or do
the slaves would scarcely know there is a republican party
i believe they would not
in fact
generally know it but for your misrepresentations of us in their hearing
in your political contests among yourselves
each faction charges the other with sympathy with black republicanism and then
to give point to the charge
defines black republicanism to simply be insurrection
and thunder among the slaves
slave insurrections are no more common now than they were before the republican party was organized
what induced the southampton insurrection
twenty eight years ago
in which at least three times as many lives were lost as at harper's ferry
you can scarcely stretch your very elastic fancy to the conclusion that southampton was got up by black republicanism
in the present state of things in the united states
i do not think a general
or even a very extensive
slave insurrection is possible
the indispensable concert of action cannot be attained
the slaves have no means of rapid communication nor can incendiary freemen
black or white
supply it
the explosive materials are everywhere in parcels but there neither are
nor can be supplied
the indispensable connecting trains
much is said by southern people about the affection of slaves for their masters and mistresses and a part of it
at least
is true
a plot for an uprising could scarcely be devised and communicated to twenty individuals before some one of them
to save the life of a favourite master or mistress
would divulge it
this is the rule and the slave revolution in haiti was not an exception to it
but a case occurring under peculiar circumstances
the gunpowder plot of british history
though not connected with slaves
was more in point
in that case
only about twenty were admitted to the secret and yet one of them
in his anxiety to save a friend
betrayed the plot to that friend
by consequence
averted the calamity
occasional poisonings from the kitchen
and open or stealthy assassinations in the field
and local revolts extending to a score or so
will continue to occur as the natural results of slavery but no general insurrection of slaves
as i think
can happen in this country for a long time
whoever much fears
or much hopes
for such an event
will be alike disappointed
in the language of mr
uttered many years ago
it is still in our power to direct the process of emancipation and deportation peaceably
and in such slow degrees as that the evil will wear off insensibly
and their places be
pari passu
filled up by free white labourers
on the contrary
it is left to force itself on
human nature must shudder at the prospect held up
mr
jefferson did not mean to say
nor do i
that the power of emancipation is in the federal government
he spoke of virginia and
as to the power of emancipation
i speak of the slaveholding states only
the federal government
as we insist
has the power of restraining the extension of the institution the power to insure that a slave insurrection shall never occur on any american soil which is now free from slavery
john brown's effort was peculiar
it was not a slave insurrection
it was an attempt by white men to get up a revolt among slaves
in which the slaves refused to participate
in fact
it was so absurd that the slaves
with all their ignorance
saw plainly enough it could not succeed
that affair
in its philosophy
corresponds with the many attempts
related in history
at the assassination of kings and emperors
an enthusiast broods over the oppression of a people till he fancies himself commissioned by heaven to liberate them
he ventures the attempt
which ends in little else than his own execution
orsini's attempt on louis napoleon
and john brown's attempt at harper's ferry
in their philosophy
precisely the same
the eagerness to cast blame on old england in the one case
and on new england in the other
does not disprove the sameness of the two things
and how much would it avail you if you could
by the use of john brown
helper's book
and the like
break up the republican organization
human action can be modified to some extent
but human nature cannot be changed
there is a judgment and a feeling against slavery in this nation
which cast at least a million and a half of votes
you cannot destroy that judgment and feeling that sentiment by breaking up the political organization which rallies around it
you can scarcely scatter and disperse an army which has been formed into order in the face of your heaviest fire but if you could
how much would you gain by forcing the sentiment which created it out of the peaceful channel of the ballot box into some other channel
what would that other channel probably be
would the number of john browns be lessened or enlarged by the operation
but you will break up the union rather than submit to a denial of your constitutional rights
that has a somewhat reckless sound but it would be palliated
if not fully justified
were we proposing
by the mere force of numbers
to deprive you of some right plainly written down in the constitution
but we are proposing no such thing
when you make these declarations you have a specific and well understood allusion to an assumed constitutional right of yours to take slaves into the federal territories
and to hold them there as property
but no such right is specifically written in the constitution
that instrument is literally silent about any such right
on the contrary
deny that such a right has any existence in the constitution
even by implication
your purpose
plainly stated
is that you will destroy the government
unless you be allowed to construe and force the constitution as you please
on all points in dispute between you and us
you will rule or ruin in all events
plainly stated
is your language
perhaps you will say the supreme court has decided the disputed constitutional question in your favour
not quite so
but waiving the lawyer's distinction between dictum and decision
the court has decided the question for you in a sort of way
the court has substantially said
it is your constitutional right to take slaves into the federal territories
and to hold them there as property
when i say the decision was made in a sort of way
i mean it was made in a divided court
by a bare majority of the judges
and they not quite agreeing with one another in the reasons for making it that it is so made as that its avowed supporters disagree with one another about its meaning
and that it was mainly based upon a mistaken statement of fact the statement in the opinion that the right of property in a slave is distinctly and expressly affirmed in the constitution
an inspection of the constitution will show that the right of property in a slave is not distinctly and expressly affirmed in it
bear in mind
the judges do not pledge their judicial opinion that such right is impliedly affirmed in the constitution but they pledge their veracity that it is distinctly and expressly affirmed there distinctly
that is
not mingled with anything else expressly
that is
in words meaning just that
without the aid of any inference
and susceptible of no other meaning
if they had only pledged their judicial opinion that such right is affirmed in the instrument by implication
it would be open to others to show that neither the word slave nor slavery is to be found in the constitution
nor the word property
even
in any connection with language alluding to the things slave or slavery and that wherever in that instrument the slave is alluded to
he is called a person and wherever his master's legal right in relation to him is alluded to
it is spoken of as service or labour which may be due as a debt payable in service or labour
also it would be open to show
by contemporaneous history
that this mode of alluding to slaves and slavery
instead of speaking of them
was employed on purpose to exclude from the constitution the idea that there could be property in man
to show all this is easy and certain
when this obvious mistake of the judges shall be brought to their notice
is it not reasonable to expect that they will withdraw the mistaken statement
and reconsider the conclusion based upon it
and then it is to be remembered that our fathers who framed the government under which we live the men who made the constitution decided this same constitutional question in our favour long ago decided it without division among themselves when making the decision without division among themselves about the meaning of it after it was made
so far as any evidence is left
without basing it upon any mistaken statement of facts
under all these circumstances
do you really feel yourselves justified to break up this government unless such a court decision as yours is shall be at once submitted to as a conclusive and final rule of political action
but you will not abide the election of a republican president
in that supposed event
you say
you will destroy the union and then
you say
the great crime of having destroyed it will be upon us
that is cool
a highwayman holds a pistol to my ear
and mutters through his teeth
stand and deliver
or i shall kill you
and then you will be a murderer
to be sure
what the robber demanded of me my money was my own and i had a clear right to keep it but it was no more my own than my vote is my own and the threat of death to me
to extort my money
and the threat of destruction to the union
to extort my vote
can scarcely be distinguished in principle
wrong as we think slavery is
we can yet afford to let it alone where it is
because that much is due to the necessity arising from its actual presence in the nation but can we
while our votes will prevent it
allow it to spread into the national territories
and to overrun us here in these free states
if our sense of duty forbids this
then let us stand by our duty fearlessly and effectively
let us be diverted by none of those sophistical contrivances wherewith we are so industriously plied and belaboured
contrivances such as groping for some middle ground between the right and the wrong
vain as the search for a man who should be neither a living man nor a dead man such as a policy of don't care
on a question about which all true men do care such as union appeals beseeching true union men to yield to disunionists
reversing the divine rule
and calling not the sinners
but the righteous to repentance such as invocations to washington
imploring men to unsay what washington said
and undo what washington did
neither let us be slandered from our duty by false accusations against us
nor frightened from it by menaces of destruction to the government
nor of dungeons to ourselves
let us have faith that right makes might
and in that faith let us to the end dare to do our duty as we understand it
lincoln's farewell address at springfield
february 11
1861 my friends
no one not in my situation can appreciate my feeling of sadness at this parting
to this place
and the kindness of these people
i owe everything
here i have lived a quarter of a century
and have passed from a young to an old man
here my children have been born
and one is buried
i now leave
not knowing when or whether ever i may return
with a task before me greater than that which rested upon washington
without the assistance of that divine being who ever attended him i cannot succeed
with that assistance i cannot fail
trusting in him
who can go with me and remain with you
and be everywhere for good
let us confidently hope that all will yet be well
to his care commending you
as i hope in your prayers you will commend me
i bid you an affectionate farewell
a letter to the hon
ashmun accepting his nomination for the presidency
may 23
1860 i accept the nomination tendered me by the convention over which you presided
and of which i am formally apprized in the letter of yourself and others
acting as a committee of the convention for that purpose
the declaration of principles and sentiments which accompanies your letter
meets my approval and it shall be my care not to violate or disregard it in any part
imploring the assistance of divine providence
and with due regard to the views and feelings of all who were represented in the convention to the rights of all the states and territories and people of the nation to the inviolability of the constitution and the perpetual union
and prosperity of all
i am most happy to co operate for the practical success of the principles declared by the convention
your obliged friend and fellow citizen
letter to miss grace bedell
october 19
1860 my dear little miss
your very agreeable letter of the 15th is received
i regret the necessity of saying i have no daughter
i have three sons one seventeen
one nine
and one seven years of age
with their mother
constitute my whole family
as to the whiskers
having never worn any
do you not think people would call it a piece of silly affectation if i were to begin it now
from an address to the legislature at indianapolis
february 12
1861 fellow citizens of the state of indiana
i am here to thank you much for this magnificent welcome
and still more for the generous support given by your state to that political cause which i think is the true and just cause of the whole country and the whole world
solomon says there is a time to keep silence
and when men wrangle by the mouth with no certainty that they mean the same thing while using the same word
it perhaps were as well if they would keep silence
the words coercion and invasion are much used in these days
and often with some temper and hot blood
let us make sure
if we can
that we do not misunderstand the meaning of those who use them
let us get exact definitions of these words
not from dictionaries
but from the men themselves
who certainly deprecate the things they would represent by the use of words
what then is coercion
what is invasion
would the marching of an army into south carolina
without the consent of her people and with hostile intent towards them
be invasion
i certainly think it would and it would be coercion also
if the south carolinians were forced to submit
but if the united states should merely retake and hold its own forts and other property
and collect the duties on foreign importations
or even withhold the mails from places where they were habitually violated
would any or all these things be invasion or coercion
do our professed lovers of the union
but who spitefully resolve that they will resist coercion and invasion
understand that such things as these
on the part of the united states
would be coercion or invasion of a state
if so
their idea of means to preserve the object of their affection would seem exceedingly thin and airy
if sick
the little pills of the homoeopathist would be much too large for them to swallow
in their view
the union as a family relation would seem to be no regular marriage
but a sort of free love arrangement to be maintained only on passional attraction
by the way
in what consists the special sacredness of a state
i speak not of the position assigned to a state in the union by the constitution for that
by the bond
we all recognize
that position
a state cannot carry out of the union with it
i speak of that assumed primary right of a state to rule all which is less than itself
and ruin all which is larger than itself
if a state and a county in a given case should be equal in extent of territory
and equal in number of inhabitants
in what
as a matter of principle
is the state better than the county
would an exchange of names be an exchange of rights upon principle
on what rightful principle may a state
being not more than one fiftieth part of the nation in soil and population
break up the nation
and then coerce a proportionally larger subdivision of itself in the most arbitrary way
what mysterious right to play tyrant is conferred on a district of country
with its people
by merely calling it a state
i am not asserting anything
i am merely asking questions for you to consider
and now allow me to bid you farewell
from his address to the legislature at columbus
february 13
1861 it is true
as has been said by the president of the senate
that a very great responsibility rests upon me in the position to which the votes of the american people have called me
i am deeply sensible of that weighty responsibility
i cannot but know
what you all know
that without a name
perhaps without a reason why i should have a name
there has fallen upon me a task such as did not rest even upon the father of his country and so feeling
i cannot but turn and look for that support without which it will be impossible for me to perform that great task
i turn then
and look to the great american people
and to that god who has never forsaken them
allusion has been made to the interest felt in relation to the policy of the new administration
in this i have received from some a degree of credit for having kept silence
and from others
some deprecation
i still think i was right
in the varying and repeatedly shifting scenes of the present
and without a precedent which could enable me to judge by the past
it has seemed fitting that before speaking upon the difficulties of the country
i should have gained a view of the whole field
being at liberty to modify and change the course of policy as future events may make a change necessary
i have not maintained silence from any want of real anxiety
it is a good thing that there is no more than anxiety
for there is nothing going wrong
it is a consoling circumstance that when we look out
there is nothing that really hurts anybody
we entertain different views upon political questions
but nobody is suffering anything
this is a most consoling circumstance
and from it we may conclude that all we want is time
and a reliance on that god who has never forsaken this people
from his remarks at pittsburgh
february 15
the condition of the country is an extraordinary one
and fills the mind of every patriot with anxiety
it is my intention to give this subject all the consideration i possibly can
before specially deciding in regard to it
so that when i do speak
it may be as nearly right as possible
when i do speak
i hope i may say nothing in opposition to the spirit of the constitution
contrary to the integrity of the union
or which will prove inimical to the liberties of the people or to the peace of the whole country
and furthermore
when the time arrives for me to speak on this great subject
i hope i may say nothing to disappoint the people generally throughout the country
especially if the expectation has been based upon anything which i have heretofore said
if the great american people only keep their temper on both sides of the line
the troubles will come to an end
and the question which now distracts the country will be settled
just as surely as all other difficulties of a like character which have originated in this government have been adjusted
let the people on both sides keep their self possession
and just as other clouds have cleared away in due time
so will this great nation continue to prosper as heretofore
it is often said that the tariff is the specialty of pennsylvania
assuming that direct taxation is not to be adopted
the tariff question must be as durable as the government itself
it is a question of national house keeping
it is to the government what replenishing the meal tub is to the family
ever varying circumstances will require frequent modifications as to the amount needed and the sources of supply
so far there is little difference of opinion among the people
it is only whether
and how far
duties on imports shall be adjusted to favour home productions
in the home market that controversy begins
one party insists that too much protection oppresses one class for the advantage of another while the other party argues that
with all its incidents
in the long run all classes are benefited
in the chicago platform there is a plank upon this subject
which should be a general law to the incoming administration
we should do neither more nor less than we gave the people reason to believe we would when they gave us their votes
that plank is as i now read
that while providing revenue for the support of the general government by duties upon imports
sound policy requires such an adjustment of these imposts as will encourage the development of the industrial interest of the whole country and we commend that policy of national exchanges which secures to working men liberal wages
to agriculture remunerating prices
to mechanics and manufacturers adequate reward for their skill
and enterprise
and to the nation commercial prosperity and independence
my political education strongly inclines me against a very free use of any of the means by the executive to control the legislation of the country
as a rule
i think it better that congress should originate as well as perfect its measures without external bias
i therefore would rather recommend to every gentleman who knows he is to be a member of the next congress
to take an enlarged view
and post himself thoroughly
so as to contribute his part to such an adjustment of the tariff as shall provide a sufficient revenue
and in its other bearings
so far as possible
be just and equal to all sections of the country and classes of the people
from his speech at trenton to the senate of new jersey
february 21
i cannot but remember the place that new jersey holds in our early history
in the early revolutionary struggle few of the states among the old thirteen had more of the battle fields of the country within their limits than old new jersey
may i be pardoned if
upon this occasion
i mention that away back in my childhood
the earliest days of my being able to read
i got hold of a small book
such a one as few of the younger members have ever seen
weems's life of washington
i remember all the accounts there given of the battle fields and struggles for the liberties of the country
and none fixed themselves upon my imagination so deeply as the struggle here at trenton
new jersey
the crossing of the river
the contest with the hessians
the great hardships endured at that time
all fixed themselves upon my memory more than any single revolutionary event and you all know
for you have all been boys
how those early impressions last longer than any others
i recollect thinking then
boy even though i was
that there must have been something more than common that these men struggled for
i am exceedingly anxious that that thing that something even more than national independence that something that held out a great promise to all the people of the world for all time to come
i am exceedingly anxious that this union
the constitution
and the liberties of the people shall be perpetuated in accordance with the original idea for which the struggle was made
and i shall be most happy indeed if i shall be an humble instrument in the hands of the almighty
and of this
his most chosen people
for perpetuating the object of that great struggle
address in independence hall
february 22
1861 i am filled with deep emotion at finding myself standing in this place
where were collected together the wisdom
the patriotism
the devotion to principle
from which sprang the institutions under which we live
you have kindly suggested to me that in my hands is the task of restoring peace to our distracted country
i can say in return
that all the political sentiments i entertain have been drawn
so far as i have been able to draw them
from the sentiments which originated in and were given to the world from this hall
i have never had a feeling
that did not spring from the sentiments embodied in the declaration of independence
i have often pondered over the dangers which were incurred by the men who assembled here and framed and adopted that declaration
i have pondered over the toils that were endured by the officers and soldiers of the army who achieved that independence
i have often inquired of myself what great principle or idea it was that kept this confederacy so long together
it was not the mere matter of separation of the colonies from the motherland
but that sentiment in the declaration of independence which gave liberty not alone to the people of this country
but hope to all the world
for all future time
it was that which gave promise that in due time the weights would be lifted from the shoulders of all men
and that all should have an equal chance
this is the sentiment embodied in the declaration of independence
my friends
can this country be saved on that basis
if it can
i will consider myself one of the happiest men in the world if i can help to save it
if it cannot be saved upon that principle
it will be truly awful
but if this country cannot be saved without giving up that principle
i was about to say i would rather be assassinated on this spot than surrender it
in my view of the present aspect of affairs
there is no need of bloodshed and war
there is no necessity for it
i am not in favour of such a course and i may say in advance that there will be no bloodshed unless it is forced upon the government
the government will not use force unless force is used against it
my friends
this is wholly an unprepared speech
i did not expect to be called on to say a word when i came here
i supposed i was merely to do something toward raising a flag
i may
have said something indiscreet
but i have said nothing but what i am willing to live by
if it be the pleasure of almighty god
to die by
reply to the mayor of washington
february 27
1861 mr
i thank you
and through you the municipal authorities of this city who accompany you
for this welcome
and as it is the first time in my life
since the present phase of politics has presented itself in this country
that i have said anything publicly within a region of country where the institution of slavery exists
i will take this occasion to say that i think very much of the ill feeling that has existed and still exists between the people in the section from which i came and the people here
is dependent upon a misunderstanding of one another
i therefore avail myself of this opportunity to assure you
and all the gentlemen present
that i have not now
and never have had
any other than as kindly feelings towards you as to the people of my own section
i have not now and never have had any disposition to treat you in any respect otherwise than as my own neighbours
i have not now any purpose to withhold from you any of the benefits of the constitution under any circumstances
that i would not feel myself constrained to withhold from my own neighbours and i hope
in a word
that when we become better acquainted
and i say it with great confidence
we shall like each other the more
i thank you for the kindness of this reception
first inaugural address
march 4
1861 fellow citizens of the united states
in compliance with a custom as old as the government itself
i appear before you to address you briefly
and to take in your presence the oath prescribed by the constitution of the united states to be taken by the president before he enters on the execution of his office
i do not consider it necessary at present for me to discuss those matters of administration about which there is no special anxiety or excitement
apprehension seems to exist among the people of the southern states that by the accession of a republican administration their property and their peace and personal security are to be endangered
there has never been any reasonable cause for such apprehension
the most ample evidence to the contrary has all the while existed and been open to their inspection
it is found in nearly all the published speeches of him who now addresses you
i do but quote from one of those speeches when i declare that i have no purpose
directly or indirectly
to interfere with the institution of slavery in the states where it exists
i believe i have no lawful right to do so
and i have no inclination to do so
those who nominated and elected me did so with full knowledge that i had made this and many similar declarations
and had never recanted them
more than this
they placed in the platform for my acceptance
and as a law to themselves and to me
the clear and emphatic resolution which i now read
resolved
that the maintenance inviolate of the rights of the states
and especially the right of each state to order and control its own domestic institutions according to its own judgment exclusively
is essential to that balance of power on which the perfection and endurance of our political fabric depend
and we denounce the lawless invasion by armed force of the soil of any state or territory
no matter under what pretext
as among the gravest of crimes
i now reiterate these sentiments and
in doing so
i only press upon the public attention the most conclusive evidence of which the case is susceptible
that the property
and security of no section are to be in any wise endangered by the now incoming administration
i add
that all the protection which
consistently with the constitution and the laws
can be given
will be cheerfully given to all the states when lawfully demanded
for whatever cause as cheerfully to one section as to another
there is much controversy about the delivering up of fugitives from service or labour
the clause i now read is as plainly written in the constitution as any other of its provisions
no person held to service or labour in one state
under the laws thereof
escaping into another
shall in consequence of any law or regulation therein be discharged from such service or labour
but shall be delivered up on claim of the party to whom such service or labour may be due
it is scarcely questioned that this provision was intended by those who made it for the reclaiming of what we call fugitive slaves and the intention of the lawgiver is the law
all members of congress swear their support to the whole constitution to this provision as much as to any other
to the proposition
that slaves whose cases come within the terms of this clause shall be delivered up
their oaths are unanimous
if they would make the effort in good temper
could they not with nearly equal unanimity frame and pass a law by means of which to keep good that unanimous oath
there is some difference of opinion whether this clause should be enforced by national or by state authority but surely that difference is not a very material one
if the slave is to be surrendered
it can be of but little consequence to him or to others by which authority it is done
and should any one in any case be content that his oath shall go unkept on a merely unsubstantial controversy as to how it shall be kept
in any law upon this subject
ought not all the safeguards of liberty known in civilized and humane jurisprudence to be introduced
so that a free man be not
in any case
surrendered as a slave
and might it not be well at the same time to provide by law for the enforcement of that clause in the constitution which guarantees that the citizen of each state shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of citizens in the several states
i take the official oath to day with no mental reservations
and with no purpose to construe the constitution or laws by any hypercritical rules
and while i do not choose now to specify particular acts of congress as proper to be enforced
i do suggest that it will be much safer for all
both in official and private stations
to conform to and abide by all those acts which stand unrepealed
than to violate any of them
trusting to find impunity in having them held to be unconstitutional
it is seventy two years since the first inauguration of a president under our national constitution
during that period fifteen different and greatly distinguished citizens have
in succession
administered the executive branch of the government they have conducted it through many perils
and generally with great success
with all this scope of precedent
i now enter upon the same task for the brief constitutional term of four years under great and peculiar difficulty
a disruption of the federal union
heretofore only menaced
is now formidably attempted
i hold that
in contemplation of universal law and of the constitution
the union of these states is perpetual
perpetuity is implied
if not expressed
in the fundamental law of all national governments
it is safe to assert that no government proper ever had a provision in its organic law for its own termination
continue to execute all the express provisions of our national constitution
and the union will endure for ever it being impossible to destroy it except by some action not provided for in the instrument itself
if the united states be not a government proper
but an association of states in the nature of contract merely
can it
as a contract
be peaceably unmade by less than all the parties who made it
one party to a contract may violate it break it
so to speak but does it not require all to lawfully rescind it
descending from these general principles
we find the proposition that in legal contemplation the union is perpetual confirmed by the history of the union itself
the union is much older than the constitution
it was formed
in fact
by the articles of association in 1774
it was matured and continued by the declaration of independence in 1776
it was further matured
and the faith of all the then thirteen states expressly plighted and engaged that it should be perpetual
by the articles of confederation in 1778
in 1787 one of the declared objects for ordaining and establishing the constitution was to form a more perfect union
but if the destruction of the union by one or by a part only of the states be lawfully possible
the union is less perfect than before the constitution
having lost the vital element of perpetuity
it follows from these views that no state upon its own mere motion can lawfully get out of the union that resolves and ordinances to that effect are legally void and that acts of violence
within any state or states
against the authority of the united states
are insurrectionary or revolutionary
according to circumstances
i therefore consider that
in view of the constitution and the laws
the union is unbroken and to the extent of my ability i shall take care
as the constitution itself expressly enjoins upon me
that the laws of the union be faithfully executed in all the states
doing this i deem to be only a simple duty on my part and i shall perform it so far as practicable
unless my rightful masters
the american people
shall withhold the requisite means
or in some authoritative manner direct the contrary
i trust this will not be regarded as a menace
but only as the declared purpose of the union that it will constitutionally defend and maintain itself
in doing this there needs to be no bloodshed or violence and there shall be none
unless it be forced upon the national authority
the power confided to me will be used to hold
and possess the property and places belonging to the government
and to collect the duties and imposts but beyond what may be necessary for these objects
there will be no invasion
no using of force against or among the people anywhere
where hostility to the united states
in any interior locality
shall be so great and universal as to prevent competent resident citizens from holding the federal offices
there will be no attempt to force obnoxious strangers among the people for that object
while the strict legal right may exist in the government to enforce the exercise of these offices
the attempt to do so would be so irritating
and so nearly impracticable withal
that i deem it better to forego for the time the uses of such offices
the mails
unless repelled
will continue to be furnished in all parts of the union
so far as possible
the people everywhere shall have that sense of perfect security which is most favourable to calm thought and reflection
the course here indicated will be followed unless current events and experience shall show a modification or change to be proper
and in every case and exigency my best discretion will be exercised according to circumstances actually existing
and with a view and a hope of a peaceful solution of the national troubles and the restoration of fraternal sympathies and affections
that there are persons in one section or another who seek to destroy the union at all events
and are glad of any pretext to do it
i will neither affirm nor deny but if there be such
i need address no word to them
to those
who really love the union may i not speak
before entering upon so grave a matter as the destruction of our national fabric
with all its benefits
its memories
and its hopes
would it not be wise to ascertain precisely why we do it
will you hazard so desperate a step while there is any possibility that any portion of the ills you fly from have no real existence
will you
while the certain ills you fly to are greater than all the real ones you fly from will you risk the commission of so fearful a mistake
all profess to be content in the union if all constitutional rights can be maintained
is it true
that any right
plainly written in the constitution
has been denied
i think not
happily the human mind is so constituted that no party can reach to the audacity of doing this
if you can
of a single instance in which a plainly written provision of the constitution has ever been denied
if by the mere force of numbers a majority should deprive a minority of any clearly written constitutional right
it might
in a moral point of view
justify revolution certainly would if such a right were a vital one
but such is not our case
all the vital rights of minorities and of individuals are so plainly assured to them by affirmations and negations
guaranties and prohibitions
in the constitution
that controversies never arise concerning them
but no organic law can ever be framed with a provision specifically applicable to every question which may occur in practical administration
no foresight can anticipate
nor any document of reasonable length contain
express provisions for all possible questions
shall fugitives from labour be surrendered by national or by state authority
the constitution does not expressly say
may congress prohibit slavery in the territories
the constitution does not expressly say
must congress protect slavery in the territories
the constitution does not expressly say
from questions of this class spring all our constitutional controversies
and we divide upon them into majorities and minorities
if the minority will not acquiesce
the majority must
or the government must cease
there is no other alternative for continuing the government is acquiescence on one side or the other
if a minority in such case will secede rather than acquiesce
they make a precedent which in turn will divide and ruin them for a minority of their own will secede from them whenever a majority refuses to be controlled by such minority
for instance
why may not any portion of a new confederacy a year or two hence arbitrarily secede again
precisely as portions of the present union now claim to secede from it
all who cherish disunion sentiments are now being educated to the exact temper of doing this
is there such perfect identity of interests among the states to compose a new union
as to produce harmony only
and prevent renewed secession
the central idea of secession is the essence of anarchy
a majority held in restraint by constitutional checks and limitations
and always changing easily with deliberate changes of popular opinions and sentiments
is the only true sovereign of a free people
whoever rejects it does
of necessity
fly to anarchy or to despotism
unanimity is impossible the rule of a minority
as a permanent arrangement
is wholly inadmissible so that
rejecting the majority principle
anarchy or despotism in some form is all that is left
i do not forget the position
assumed by some
that constitutional questions are to be decided by the supreme court nor do i deny that such decisions must be binding
in any case
upon the parties to a suit
as to the object of that suit
while they are also entitled to very high respect and consideration in all parallel cases by all other departments of the government
and while it is obviously possible that such decision may be erroneous in any given case
still the evil effect following it
being limited to that particular case
with the chance that it may be overruled and never become a precedent for other cases
can better be borne than could the evils of a different practice
at the same time
the candid citizen must confess that if the policy of the government
upon vital questions affecting the whole people
is to be irrevocably fixed by decisions of the supreme court
the instant they are made
in ordinary litigation between parties in personal actions
the people will have ceased to be their own rulers
having to that extent practically resigned their government into the hands of that eminent tribunal
nor is there in this view any assault upon the court or the judges
it is a duty from which they may not shrink to decide cases properly brought before them
and it is no fault of theirs if others seek to turn their decisions to political purposes
one section of our country believes slavery is right
and ought to be extended
while the other believes it is wrong
and ought not to be extended
this is the only substantial dispute
the fugitive slave clause of the constitution
and the law for the suppression of the foreign slave trade
are each as well enforced
as any law can ever be in a community where the moral sense of the people imperfectly supports the law itself
the great body of the people abide by the dry legal obligation in both cases
and a few break over in each
i think
cannot be perfectly cured and it would be worse in both cases after the separation of the sections than before
the foreign slave trade
now imperfectly suppressed
would be ultimately revived
without restriction
in one section
while fugitive slaves
now only partially surrendered
would not be surrendered at all by the other
physically speaking
we cannot separate
we cannot remove our respective sections from each other
nor build an impassable wall between them
a husband and wife may be divorced
and go out of the presence and beyond the reach of each other but the different parts of our country cannot do this
they cannot but remain face to face
and intercourse
either amicable or hostile
must continue between them
is it possible
to make that intercourse more advantageous or more satisfactory after separation than before
can aliens make treaties easier than friends can make laws
can treaties be more faithfully enforced between aliens than laws can among friends
suppose you go to war
you cannot fight always and when
after much loss on both sides
and no gain on either
you cease fighting
the identical old questions as to terms of intercourse are again upon you
this country
with its institutions
belongs to the people who inhabit it
whenever they shall grow weary of the existing government
they can exercise their constitutional right of amending it
or their revolutionary right to dismember or overthrow it
i cannot be ignorant of the fact that many worthy and patriotic citizens are desirous of having the national constitution amended
while i make no recommendation of amendments
i fully recognize the rightful authority of the people over the whole subject
to be exercised in either of the modes prescribed in the instrument itself and i should
under existing circumstances
favour rather than oppose a fair opportunity being afforded the people to act upon it
i will venture to add that to me the convention mode seems preferable
in that it allows amendments to originate with the people themselves
instead of only permitting them to take or reject propositions originated by others not especially chosen for the purpose
and which might not be precisely such as they would wish to either accept or refuse
i understand a proposed amendment to the constitution which amendment
i have not seen has passed congress
to the effect that the federal government shall never interfere with the domestic institutions of the states
including that of persons held to service
to avoid misconstruction of what i have said
i depart from my purpose not to speak of particular amendments so far as to say that
holding such a provision to now be implied constitutional law
i have no objection to its being made express and irrevocable
the chief magistrate derives all his authority from the people
and they have conferred none upon him to fix terms for the separation of the states
the people themselves can do this also if they choose but the executive
as such
has nothing to do with it
his duty is to administer the present government
as it came to his hands
and to transmit it
unimpaired by him
to his successor
why should there not be a patient confidence in the ultimate justice of the people
is there any better or equal hope in the world
in our present differences
is either party without faith of being in the right
if the almighty ruler of nations
with his eternal truth and justice
be on your side of the north
or on yours of the south
that truth and that justice will surely prevail by the judgment of this great tribunal of the american people
by the frame of the government under which we live
this same people have wisely given their public servants but little power for mischief and have
with equal wisdom
provided for the return of that little to their own hands at very short intervals
while the people retain their virtue and vigilance
no administration
by any extreme of wickedness or folly
can very seriously injure the government in the short space of four years
my countrymen
one and all
think calmly and well upon this whole subject
nothing valuable can be lost by taking time
if there be an object to hurry any of you in hot haste to a step which you would never take deliberately
that object will be frustrated by taking time but no good object can be frustrated by it
such of you as are now dissatisfied still have the old constitution unimpaired
on the sensitive point
the laws of your own framing under it while the new administration will have no immediate power
if it would
to change either
if it were admitted that you who are dissatisfied hold the right side in the dispute
there still is no single good reason for precipitate action
and a firm reliance on him who has never yet forsaken this favoured land
are still competent to adjust in the best way all our present difficulty
in your hands
my dissatisfied fellow countrymen
and not in mine
is the momentous issue of civil war
the government will not assail you
you can have no conflict without being yourselves the aggressors
you have no oath registered in heaven to destroy the government
while i shall have the most solemn one to preserve
and defend it
i am loath to close
we are not enemies
but friends
we must not be enemies
though passion may have strained
it must not break our bonds of affection
the mystic chords of memory
stretching from every battle field and patriot grave to every living heart and hearthstone all over this broad land
will yet swell the chorus of the union when again touched
as surely they will be
by the better angels of our nature
address at utica
new york
february 18
1861 ladies and gentlemen
i have no speech to make to you
and no time to speak in
i appear before you that i may see you
and that you may see me and i am willing to admit
so far as the ladies are concerned
i have the best of the bargain
though i wish it to be understood that i do not make the same acknowledgment concerning the men
from his first message to congress
at the special session
july 4
it is thus seen that the assault upon and reduction of fort sumter was in no sense a matter of self defence on the part of the assailants
they well knew that the garrison in the fort could by no possibility commit aggression upon them
they knew they were expressly notified that the giving of bread to the few brave and hungry men of the garrison was all which would on that occasion be attempted
unless themselves
by resisting so much
should provoke more
they knew that this government desired to keep the garrison in the fort
not to assail them
but merely to maintain visible possession
and thus to preserve the union from actual and immediate dissolution
as hereinbefore stated
to time
and the ballot box
for final adjustment and they assailed and reduced the fort for precisely the reverse object
to drive out the visible authority of the federal union
and thus force it to immediate dissolution
that this was their object the executive well understood and having said to them in the inaugural address
you can have no conflict without being yourselves the aggressors
he took pains not only to keep this declaration good
but also to keep the case so free from the power of ingenious sophistry that the world should not be able to misunderstand it
by the affair at fort sumter
with its surrounding circumstances
that point was reached
then and thereby the assailants of the government began the conflict of arms
without a gun in sight
or in expectancy to return their fire
save only the few in the fort sent to that harbour years before for their own protection
and still ready to give that protection in whatever was lawful
in this act
discarding all else
they have forced upon the country the distinct issue
immediate dissolution or blood
and this issue embraces more than the fate of these united states
it presents to the whole family of man the question whether a constitutional republic or democracy a government of the people by the same people can or cannot maintain its territorial integrity against its own domestic foes
it presents the question whether discontented individuals
too few in numbers to control administration according to organic law in any case
can always
upon the pretences made in this case or any other pretences
or arbitrarily without any pretence
break up their government
and thus practically put an end to free government upon the earth
it forces us to ask
is there
in all republics
this inherent and fatal weakness
must a government
of necessity
be too strong for the liberties of its own people
or too weak to maintain its own existence
so viewing the issue
no choice was left but to call out the war power of the government
and so to resist force employed for its destruction by force for its preservation
the call was made
and the response of the country was most gratifying
surpassing in unanimity and spirit the most sanguine expectation
the people of virginia have thus allowed this giant insurrection to make its nest within her borders
and this government has no choice left but to deal with it where it finds it
and it has the less regret
as the loyal citizens have in due form claimed its protection
those loyal citizens this government is bound to recognize and protect
as being virginia
in the border states
so called
in fact
the middle states
there are those who favour a policy which they call armed neutrality that is
an arming of those states to prevent the union forces passing one way
or the disunion the other
over their soil
this would be disunion completed
figuratively speaking
it would be the building of an impassable wall along the line of separation
and yet not quite an impassable one
for under the guise of neutrality
it would tie the hands of union men
and freely pass supplies from among them to the insurrectionists
which it could not do as an open enemy
at a stroke
it would take all the trouble off the hands of secession
except only what proceeds from the external blockade
it would do for the disunionists that which of all things they most desire
feed them well and give them disunion without a struggle of their own
it recognizes no fidelity to the constitution
no obligation to maintain the union and while very many who have favoured it are doubtless loyal citizens
it is
very injurious in effect
the forbearance of this government had been so extraordinary and so long continued
as to lead some foreign nations to shape their action as if they supposed the early destruction of our national union was probable
while this
on discovery
gave the executive some concern
he is now happy to say that the sovereignty and rights of the united states are now everywhere practically respected by foreign powers
and a general sympathy with the country is manifested throughout the world
it is now recommended that you give the legal means for making this contest a short and decisive one that you place at the control of the government for the work
at least four hundred thousand men
and 400
that number of men is about one tenth of those of proper ages within the regions where
all are willing to engage and the sum is less than a twenty third part of the money value owned by the men who seem ready to devote the whole
a right result at this time
will be worth more to the world than ten times the men and ten times the money
the evidences reaching us from the country leaves no doubt that the material for the work is abundant
and that it needs only the hand of legislation to give it legal sanction
and the hand of the executive to give it practical shape and efficiency
one of the greatest perplexities of the government is to avoid receiving troops faster than it can provide for them
in a word
the people will save their government
if the government itself will do its part only indifferently well
it might seem at first thought to be of little difference whether the present movement at the south be called secession or rebellion
the movers
well understand the difference
at the beginning they knew they could never raise their treason to any respectable magnitude by any name which implies violation of law
they knew their people possessed as much of moral sense
as much of devotion to law and order
and as much pride in and reverence for the history and government of their common country as any other civilized and patriotic people
they knew they could make no advancement directly in the teeth of these strong and noble sentiments
they commenced by an insidious debauching of the public mind
they invented an ingenious sophism which
if conceded
was followed by perfectly logical steps
through all the incidents
to the complete destruction of the union
the sophism itself is that any state of the union may consistently with the national constitution
and therefore lawfully and peacefully
withdraw from the union without the consent of the union or of any other state
the little disguise that the supposed right is to be exercised only for just cause
themselves to be the sole judges of its justice
is too thin to merit any notice
with rebellion thus sugar coated they have been drugging the public mind of their section for more than thirty years
and until at length they have brought many good men to a willingness to take up arms against the government the day after some assemblage of men have enacted the farcical pretence of taking their state out of the union
who could have been brought to no such thing the day before
this sophism derives much
perhaps the whole of its currency from the assumption that there is some omnipotent and sacred supremacy pertaining to a state to each state of our federal union
our states have neither more nor less power than that reserved to them in the union by the constitution
no one of them ever having been a state out of the union
the original ones passed into the union even before they cast off their british colonial dependence
and the new ones each came into the union directly from a condition of dependence
excepting texas
and even texas in its temporary independence was never designated a state
the new ones only took the designation of states on coming into the union
while that name was first adopted for the old ones in and by the declaration of independence
therein the united colonies were declared to be free and independent states but even then the object plainly was
not to declare their independence of one another or of the union
but directly the contrary
as their mutual pledges and their mutual action before
at the time
and afterward abundantly show
the express plighting of faith by each and all of the original thirteen in the articles of confederation two years later
that the union shall be perpetual
is most conclusive
having never been states
either in substance or name
outside of the union
whence this magical omnipotence of state rights
asserting a claim of power to lawfully destroy the union itself
much is said about the sovereignty of the states but the word is not in the national constitution
as is believed
in any of the state constitutions
what is sovereignty in the political sense of the term
would it be far wrong to define it a political community without a political superior
tested by this
no one of our states
except texas
ever was a sovereignty
and even texas gave up the character on coming into the union
by which act she acknowledged the constitution of the united states
and the laws and treaties of the united states made in pursuance of the constitution
to be for her the supreme law of the land
the states have their status in the union
and they have no other legal status
if they break from this
they can only do so against law and by revolution
the union
and not themselves separately
procured their independence and their liberty
by conquest or purchase
the union gave each of them whatever of independence or liberty it has
the union is older than any of the states
in fact
it created them as states
originally some dependent colonies made the union
and in turn the union threw off their old dependence for them
and made them states
such as they are
not one of them ever had a state constitution independent of the union
of course it is not forgotten that all the new states framed their constitutions before they entered the union
dependent upon and preparatory to coming into the union
unquestionably the states have the powers and the rights reserved to them in and by the national constitution but among these
are not included all conceivable powers
however mischievous or destructive but
at most
such only as were known in the world at the time
as governmental powers and
a power to destroy the government itself had never been known as a governmental as a merely administrative power
this relative matter of national power and states rights
as a principle
is no other than the principle of generality and locality
whatever concerns the whole world should be confided to the whole to the general government while whatever concerns only the state should be left exclusively to the state
this is all there is of original principle about it
what is now combated
is the position that secession is consistent with the constitution is lawful and peaceful
it is not contended that there is any express law for it and nothing should ever be implied as law which leads to unjust or absurd consequences
the nation purchased with money the countries out of which several of these states were formed is it just that they shall go off without leave and without refunding
the nation paid very large sums in the aggregate
i believe
nearly a hundred millions to relieve florida of the aboriginal tribes is it just that she shall now be off without consent
or without making any return
the nation is now in debt for money applied to the benefit of these so called seceding states in common with the rest is it just that the creditors shall go unpaid
or the remaining states pay the whole
if one state may secede
so may another and when all shall have seceded
none is left to pay the debts
is this quite just to the creditors
did we notify them of this sage view of ours when we borrowed their money
if we now recognize this doctrine by allowing the seceders to go in peace
it is difficult to see what we can do if others choose to go
or to extort terms upon which they will promise to remain
the seceders insist that our constitution admits of secession
they have assumed to make a national constitution of their own
in which
of necessity
they have either discarded or retained the right of secession
as they insist it exists in ours
if they have discarded it
they thereby admit that
on principle
it ought not to be in ours
if they have retained it
by their own construction of ours
they show that to be consistent they must secede from one another whenever they shall find it the easiest way of settling their debts
or effecting any other or selfish or unjust object
the principle itself is one of disintegration
and upon which no government can stand
if all the states save one should assert the power to drive that one out of the union
it is presumed the whole class of seceder politicians would at once deny the power
and denounce the act as the greatest outrage upon state rights
but suppose that precisely the same act
instead of being called driving the one out
should be called the seceding of the others from that one
it would be exactly what the seceders claim to do unless
they make the point that the one
because it is a minority
may rightfully do what the others
because they are a majority
may not rightfully do
it may be affirmed without extravagance that the free institutions we enjoy have developed the powers and improved the condition of our whole people
beyond any example in the world
of this we now have a striking and an impressive illustration
so large an army as the government has now on foot was never before known
without a soldier in it but who has taken his place there of his own free choice
but more than this
there are many single regiments
whose members
one and another
possess full practical knowledge of all the arts
and professions
and whatever else
whether useful or elegant
is known in the world and there is scarcely one from which there could not be selected a president
a cabinet
a congress
and perhaps a court
abundantly competent to administer the government itself
nor do i say that this is not true also in the army of our late friends
now adversaries in this contest but if it is
so much the better reason why the government which has conferred such benefits on both them and us should not be broken up
whoever in any section proposes to abandon such a government
would do well to consider in deference to what principle it is that he does it what better he is likely to get in its stead whether the substitute will give
or be intended to give
so much of good to the people
there are some foreshadowings on this subject
our adversaries have adopted some declarations of independence in which
unlike the good old one penned by jefferson
they omit the words
all men are created equal
why
they have adopted a temporary national constitution
in the preamble of which
unlike our good old one signed by washington
they omit we
the people
and substitute we
the deputies of the sovereign and independent states
why
why this deliberate pressing out of view the rights of men and the authority of the people
this is essentially a people's contest
on the side of the union it is a struggle for maintaining in the world that form and substance of government whose leading object is to elevate the condition of men
to lift artificial weights from all shoulders
to clear the paths of laudable pursuit for all
to afford all an unfettered start and a fair chance in the race of life
yielding to partial and temporary departures from necessity
this is the leading object of the government for the existence of which we contend
i am most happy to believe that the plain people understand and appreciate this
it is worthy of note that while in this
the government's hour of trial
large numbers of those in the army and navy who have been favoured with the offices have resigned and proved false to the hand which had pampered them
not one common soldier or common sailor is known to have deserted his flag
our popular government has often been called an experiment
two points in it our people have already settled
the successful establishing and the successful administering of it
one still remains
its successful maintenance against a formidable internal attempt to overthrow it
it is now for them to demonstrate to the world that those who can fairly carry an election can also suppress a rebellion that ballots are the rightful and peaceful successors of bullets and that when ballots have fairly and constitutionally decided
there can be no successful appeal back to bullets that there can be no successful appeal
except to ballots themselves
at succeeding elections
such will be a great lesson of peace teaching men that what they cannot take by an election
neither can they take by a war teaching all the folly of being the beginners of a war
from his message to congress at its regular session
december 3
1861 fellow citizens of the senate and house of representatives
in the midst of unprecedented political troubles
we have cause of great gratitude to god for unusual good health and abundant harvests
you will not be surprised to learn that in the peculiar exigencies of the times
our intercourse with foreign nations has been attended with profound solicitude
chiefly turning upon our own domestic affairs
a disloyal portion of the american people have
during the whole year
been engaged in an attempt to divide and destroy the union
a nation which endures factious domestic division is exposed to disrespect abroad and one party
if not both
is sure
sooner or later
to invoke foreign intervention
nations thus tempted to interfere are not always able to resist the counsels of seeming expediency and ungenerous ambition
although measures adopted under such influences seldom fail to be injurious and unfortunate to those adopting them
the disloyal citizens of the united states who have offered the ruin of our country in return for the aid and comfort which they have invoked abroad
have received less patronage and encouragement than they probably expected
if it were just to suppose
as the insurgents have seemed to assume
that foreign nations in this case
discarding all moral
and treaty obligations
would act solely and selfishly for the most speedy restoration of commerce
including especially the acquisition of cotton
those nations appear as yet not to have seen their way to their object more directly or clearly through the destruction than through the preservation of the union
if we could dare to believe that foreign nations are actuated by no higher principle than this
i am quite sure a sound argument could be made to show them that they can reach their aim more readily and easily by aiding to crush this rebellion than by giving encouragement to it
the principal lever relied on by the insurgents for exciting foreign nations to hostility against us
as already intimated
is the embarrassment of commerce
those nations
not improbably saw from the first that it was the union which made as well our foreign as our domestic commerce
they can scarcely have failed to perceive that the effort for disunion produces the existing difficulty and that one strong nation promises a more durable peace and a more extensive
and reliable commerce than can the same nation broken into hostile fragments
it continues to develop that the insurrection is largely
if not exclusively
a war upon the first principle of popular government
the rights of the people
conclusive evidence of this is found in the most grave and maturely considered public documents
as well as in the general tone of the insurgents
in those documents we find the abridgment of the existing right of suffrage
and the denial to the people of all right to participate in the selection of public officers
except the legislative
boldly advocated
with laboured arguments to prove that large control of the people in government is the source of all political evil
monarchy itself is sometimes hinted at
as a possible refuge from the power of the people
in my present position
i could scarcely be justified were i to omit raising a warning voice against this approach of returning despotism
it is not needed nor fitting here that a general argument should be made in favour of popular institutions but there is one point
with its connections
not so hackneyed as most others
to which i ask a brief attention
it is the effort to place capital on an equal footing with
if not above
in the structure of government
it is assumed that labour is available only in connection with capital that nobody labours
unless somebody else
owning capital
by the use of it
induces him to labour
this assumed
it is next considered whether it is best that capital shall hire labourers
and thus induce them to work by their own consent
or buy them and drive them to it without their consent
having proceeded thus far
it is naturally concluded that all labourers are either hired labourers
or what we call slaves
and further
it is assumed that whoever is once a hired labourer is fixed in that condition for life
there is no such relation between capital and labour as assumed
nor is there any such thing as a free man being fixed for life in the condition of a hired labourer
both these assumptions are false
and all inferences from them are groundless
labour is prior to and independent of capital
capital is only the fruit of labour
and could never have existed if labour had not first existed
labour is the superior of capital
and deserves much the higher consideration
capital has its rights
which are as worthy of protection as any other rights
nor is it denied that there is
and probably always will be
a relation between labour and capital
producing mutual benefits
the error is in assuming that the whole labour of the community exists within that relation
a few men own capital
and that few avoid labour themselves
and with their capital hire or buy another few to labour for them
a large majority belong to neither class
neither work for others
nor have others working for them
in most of the southern states
a majority of the whole people
of all colours
are neither slaves nor masters while in the northern
a majority are neither hirers nor hired
men with their families wives
and daughters work for themselves
on their farms
in their houses
and in their shops
taking the whole product to themselves
and asking no favours of capital on the one hand
nor of hired labourers or slaves on the other
it is not forgotten that a considerable number of persons mingle their own labour with capital that is
they labour with their own hands
and also buy or hire others to labour for them but this is only a mixed and not a distinct class
no principle stated is disturbed by the existence of this mixed class
as has already been said
there is not of necessity any such thing as the free
hired labourer being fixed to that condition for life
many independent men
everywhere in these states
a few years back in their lives were hired labourers
the prudent
penniless beginner in the world labours for wages a while
saves a surplus with which to buy tools or land for himself
then labours on his own account another while
and at length hires another new beginner to help him
this is the just and generous and prosperous system which opens the way to all
gives hope to all
and consequent energy and progress and improvement of condition to all
no men living are more worthy to be trusted than those who toil up from poverty
none less inclined to take or touch aught which they have not honestly earned
let them beware of surrendering a political power which they already possess
and which
if surrendered
will surely be used to close the door of advancement against such as they
and to fix new disabilities and burdens upon them
till all of liberty shall be lost
letter to general g
february 3
1862 my dear sir
you and i have distinct and different plans for a movement of the army of the potomac yours to be down the chesapeake
up the rappahannock to urbana and across land to the terminus of the railroad on the york river mine to move directly to a point on the railroad southwest of manassas
if you will give me satisfactory answers to the following questions
i shall gladly yield my plan to yours
does not your plan involve a greatly larger expenditure of time and money than mine
wherein is a victory more certain by your plan than mine
wherein is a victory more valuable by your plan than mine
in fact
would it not be less valuable in this
that it would break no great line of the enemy's communications
while mine would
in case of disaster
would not a retreat be more difficult by your plan than mine
i have just assisted the secretary of war in framing part of a despatch to you
relating to army corps
which despatch of course will have reached you long before this will
i wish to say a few words to you privately on this subject
i ordered the army corps organization
not only on the unanimous opinion of the twelve generals whom you had selected and assigned as generals of division
but also on the unanimous opinion of every military man i could get an opinion from and every modern military book
yourself only excepted
of course i did not on my own judgment pretend to understand the subject
i now think it indispensable for you to know how your struggle against it is received in quarters which we cannot entirely disregard
it is looked upon as merely an effort to pamper one or two pets and to persecute and degrade their supposed rivals
i have had no word from sumner
or keyes
the commanders of these corps are of course the three highest officers with you
but i am constantly told that you have no consultation or communication with them
that you consult and communicate with nobody but general fitz john porter
and perhaps general franklin
i do not say these complaints are true or just
but at all events it is proper you should know of their existence
do the commanders of corps disobey your orders in anything
are you strong enough are you strong enough
even with my help to set your foot upon the necks of sumner
and keyes
all at once
this is a practical and a very serious question for you
lincoln's proclamation revoking general hunter's order setting the slaves free
may 19
general hunter nor any other commander or person has been authorized by the government of the united states to make proclamation declaring the slaves of any state free
and that the supposed proclamation now in question
whether genuine or false
is altogether void so far as respects such declaration
on the sixth day of march last
by a special message
i recommended to congress the adoption of a joint resolution
to be substantially as follows
that the united states ought to co operate with any state which may adopt a gradual abolishment of slavery
giving to such state earnest expression to compensate for its inconveniences
public and private
produced by such change of system
the resolution in the language above quoted was adopted by large majorities in both branches of congress
and now stands an authentic
and solemn proposal of the nation to the states and people most immediately interested in the subject matter
to the people of those states i now earnestly appeal
i do not argue i beseech you to make arguments for yourselves
you cannot
if you would
be blind to the signs of the times
i beg of you a calm and enlarged consideration of them
if it may be
far above personal and partisan politics
the proposal makes common cause for a common object
casting no reproaches upon any
it acts not the pharisee
the change it contemplates would come gently as the dews of heaven
not rending or wrecking anything
will you not embrace it
so much good has not been done by one effort in all past time as in the providence of god it is now your high privilege to do
may the vast future not have to lament that you have neglected it
appeal to the border states in behalf of compensated emancipation
july 12
1862 after the adjournment of congress
now near
i shall have no opportunity of seeing you for several months
believing that you of the border states hold more power for good than any other equal number of members
i feel it a duty which i cannot justifiably waive
to make this appeal to you
i do not speak of emancipation at once
but of a decision at once to emancipate gradually
room in south america for colonization can be obtained cheaply and in abundance
and when numbers shall be large enough to be company and encouragement for one another
the freed people will not be so reluctant to go
i am pressed with a difficulty not yet mentioned
one which threatens division among those who
are none too strong
general hunter is an honest man
he was
and i hope still is
my friend
i valued him none the less for his agreeing with me in the general wish that all men everywhere could be free
he proclaimed all men free within certain states
and i repudiated the proclamation
he expected more good and less harm from the measure than i could believe would follow
yet in repudiating it
i gave dissatisfaction if not offence to many whose support the country cannot afford to lose
and this is not the end of it
the pressure in this direction is still upon me
and is increasing
by conceding what i now ask
you can relieve me
much more
can relieve the country
in this important point
upon these considerations i have again begged your attention to the message of march last
before leaving the capitol
consider and discuss it among yourselves
you are patriots and statesmen
and as such
i pray you
consider this proposition
and at the least commend it to the consideration of your states and people
as you would perpetuate popular government for the best people in the world
i beseech you that you do in no wise omit this
our common country is in great peril
demanding the loftiest views and boldest action to bring it speedy relief
once relieved
its form of government is saved to the world
its beloved history and cherished memories are vindicated
and its happy future fully assured and rendered inconceivably grand
i intend no reproach or complaint when i assure you that
in my opinion
if you all had voted for the resolution in the gradual emancipation message of last march
the war would now be substantially ended
and the plan therein proposed is yet one of the most potent and swift means of ending it
let the states which are in rebellion see
definitely and certainly
that in no event will the states you represent ever join their proposed confederacy
and they cannot much longer maintain the contest
but you cannot divest them of their hope to ultimately have you with them
so long as you show a determination to perpetuate the institution within your own states
beat them at elections
as you have overwhelmingly done
nothing daunted
they still claim you as their own
you and i know what the lever of their power is
break that lever before their faces
and they can shake you no more for ever
most of you have treated me with kindness and consideration
and i trust you will not now think i improperly touch what is exclusively your own
for the sake of the whole country
i ask
can you
for your states
do better than to take the course i urge
discarding punctilio and maxims adapted to more manageable times
and looking only to the unprecedentedly stern facts of our case
can you do better in any possible event
you prefer that the constitutional relation of the states to the nation shall be practically restored without disturbance of the institution and if this were done
my whole duty in this respect
under the constitution and my oath of office
would be performed
but it is not done
and we are trying to accomplish it by war
the incidents of the war cannot be avoided
if the war continues long
as it must if the object be not sooner attained
the institution in your states will be extinguished by mere friction and abrasion
by the mere incidents of the war
it will be gone
and you will have nothing valuable in lieu of it
much of its value is gone already
how much better for you and for your people to take the step which at once shortens the war and secures substantial compensation for that which is sure to be wholly lost in any other event
how much better to thus save the money which else we sink for ever in the war
how much better to do it while we can
lest the war ere long render us pecuniarily unable to do it
how much better for you as seller
and the nation as buyer
to sell out and buy out that without which the war could never have been
than to sink both the thing to be sold and the price of it in cutting one another's throats
from a letter to cuthbert bullitt
july 28
1862 now
i think the true remedy is very different from that suggested by mr
it does not lie in rounding the rough angles of the war
but in removing the necessity for the war
the people of louisiana who wish protection to person and property
have but to reach forth their hands and take it
let them in good faith reinaugurate the national authority
and set up a state government conforming thereto under the constitution
they know how to do it
and can have the protection of the army while doing it
the army will be withdrawn as soon as such government can dispense with its presence
and the people of the state can then
upon the old constitutional terms
govern themselves to their own liking
this is very simple and easy
if they will not do this
if they prefer to hazard all for the sake of destroying the government
it is for them to consider whether it is probable that i will surrender the government to save them from losing all
if they decline what i suggest
you will scarcely need to ask what i will do
what would you do in my position
would you drop the war where it is
or would you prosecute it in future with elder stalk squirts charged with rose water
would you deal lighter blows rather than heavier ones
would you give up the contest
leaving any available means untried
i am in no boastful mood
i shall not do more than i can but i shall do all i can to save the government
which is my sworn duty as well as my personal inclination
i shall do nothing in malice
what i deal with is too vast for malicious dealing
letter to august belmont
july 31
1862 dear sir
you send to mr
w an extract from a letter written at new orleans the 9th instant
which is shown to me
you do not give the writer's name but plainly he is a man of ability
and probably of some note
he says
the time has arrived when mr
lincoln must take a decisive course
trying to please everybody
he will satisfy nobody
a vacillating policy in matters of importance is the very worst
now is the time
if ever
for honest men who love their country to rally to its support
why will not the north say officially that it wishes for the restoration of the union as it was
and so
it seems
this is the point on which the writer thinks i have no policy
why will he not read and understand what i have said
the substance of the very declaration he desires is in the inaugural
in each of the two regular messages to congress
and in many
if not all
the minor documents issued by the executive since the inauguration
broken eggs cannot be mended but louisiana has nothing to do now but to take her place in the union as it was
barring the already broken eggs
the sooner she does so
the smaller will be the amount of that which will be past mending
this government cannot much longer play a game in which it stakes all
and its enemies stake nothing
those enemies must understand that they cannot experiment for ten years trying to destroy the government
and if they fail still come back into the union unhurt
if they expect in any contingency to ever have the union as it was
i join with the writer in saying
now is the time
how much better it would have been for the writer to have gone at this
under the protection of the army at new orleans
than to have sat down in a closet writing complaining letters northward
his letter to horace greeley
august 22
1862 i have just read yours of the 19th instant
addressed to myself through the new york tribune
if there be in it any statements or assumptions of fact which i may know to be erroneous
i do not now and here controvert them
if there be in it any inferences which i may believe to be falsely drawn
i do not now and here argue against them
if there be perceptible in it an impatient and dictatorial tone
i waive it
in deference to an old friend whose heart i have always supposed to be right
as to the policy i seem to be pursuing
as you say
i have not meant to leave any one in doubt
i would save the union
i would save it in the shortest way under the constitution
the sooner the national authority can be restored
the nearer the union will be
the union as it was
if there be those who would not save the union unless they could at the same time save slavery
i do not agree with them
if there be those who would not save the union unless they could at the same time destroy slavery
i do not agree with them
my paramount object in this struggle is to save the union
and not either to save or to destroy slavery
if i could save the union without freeing any slave
i would do it if i could save it by freeing all the slaves
i would do it and if i could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone
i would also do that
what i do about slavery and the coloured race
i do because i believe it helps to save the union and what i forbear
i forbear because i do not believe it would help to save the union
i shall do less whenever i shall believe that what i am doing hurts the cause and i shall do more whenever i shall believe doing more will help the cause
i shall try to correct errors where shown to be errors
and i shall adopt new views as fast as they shall appear to be true views
i have here stated my purpose according to my views of official duty
and i intend no modification of my oft expressed personal wish that all men everywhere could be free
from his reply to the chicago committee of united religious denominations
september 13
1862 the subject presented in the memorial is one upon which i have thought much for weeks past
and i may even say for months
i am approached with the most opposite opinions and advice
and that by religious men
who are equally certain that they represent the divine will
i am sure that either the one or the other class is mistaken in that belief
and perhaps
in some respects
i hope it will not be irreverent for me to say
that if it is probable that god would reveal his will to others
on a point so connected with my duty
it might be supposed that he would reveal it directly to me for
unless i am more deceived in myself than i often am
it is my earnest desire to know the will of providence in this matter
and if i can learn what it is
i will do it
these are not
the days of miracles
and i suppose it will be granted that i am not to expect a direct revelation
i must study the plain
physical facts of the case
ascertain what is possible
and learn what appears to be wise and right
the subject is difficult
and good men do not agree
for instance
four gentlemen of standing and intelligence
from new york
called as a delegation on business connected with the war but before leaving
two of them earnestly besought me to proclaim general emancipation
upon which the other two at once attacked them
you also know that the last session of congress had a decided majority of anti slavery men
yet they could not unite on this policy
and the same is true of the religious people
why the rebel soldiers are praying with a great deal more earnestness
i fear
than our own troops
and expecting god to favour their side
for one of our soldiers who had been taken prisoner told senator wilson a few days since that he met nothing so discouraging as the evident sincerity of those he was among in their prayers
but we will talk over the merits of the case
what good would a proclamation of emancipation from me do
especially as we are now situated
i do not want to issue a document that the whole world will see must necessarily be inoperative
like the pope's bull against the comet
would my word free the slaves
when i cannot even enforce the constitution in the rebel states
is there a single court or magistrate or individual that would be influenced by it there
and what reason is there to think it would have any greater effect upon the slaves than the late law of congress
which i approved
and which offers protection and freedom to the slaves of rebel masters who come within our lines
yet i cannot learn that that law has caused a single slave to come over to us
and suppose they could be induced by a proclamation of freedom from me to throw themselves upon us
what should we do with them
how can we feed and care for such a multitude
general butler wrote me a few days since that he was issuing more rations to the slaves who have rushed to him than to all the white troops under his command
they eat
and that is all though it is true general butler is feeding the whites also by the thousand
for it nearly amounts to a famine there
if now
the pressure of the war should call off our forces from new orleans to defend some other point
what is to prevent the masters from reducing the blacks to slavery again
for i am told that whenever the rebels take any black prisoners
free or slave
they immediately auction them off
they did so with those they took from a boat that was aground in the tennessee river a few days ago
and then i am very ungenerously attacked for it
for instance
after the late battles at and near bull run
an expedition went out from washington under a flag of truce to bury the dead and bring in the wounded
and the rebels seized the blacks who went along to help
and sent them into slavery
horace greeley said in his paper that the government would probably do nothing about it
what could i do
tell me
if you please
what possible result of good would follow the issuing of such a proclamation as you desire
i raise no objections against it on legal or constitutional grounds
as commander in chief of the army and navy
in time of war i suppose i have a right to take any measures which may best subdue the enemy nor do i urge objections of a moral nature
in view of possible consequences of insurrection and massacre at the south
i view this matter as a practical war measure
to be decided on according to the advantages or disadvantages it may offer to the suppression of the rebellion
the committee had said that emancipation would secure us the sympathy of the world
slavery being the cause of the war
to which the president replied
i admit that slavery is at the root of the rebellion
or at least its sine qua non
the ambition of politicians may have instigated them to act
but they would have been impotent without slavery as their instrument
i will also concede that emancipation would help us in europe
and convince them that we are incited by something more than ambition
i grant further
that it would help somewhat at the north
though not so much
i fear
as you and those you represent
some additional strength would be added in that way to the war
and then
it would weaken the rebels by drawing off their labourers
which is of great importance but i am not so sure that we could do much with the blacks
if we were to arm them
i fear that in a few weeks the arms would be in the hands of the rebels and indeed
thus far
we have not had arms enough to equip our white troops
i will mention another thing
though it meet only your scorn and contempt
there are fifty thousand bayonets in the union armies from the border slave states
it would be a serious matter if
in consequence of a proclamation such as you desire
they should go over to the rebels
i do not think they all would
not so many indeed
as a year ago
nor as six months ago not so many to day as yesterday
every day increases their union feeling
they are also getting their pride enlisted
and want to beat the rebels
let me say one thing more
i think you should admit that we already have an important principle to rally and unite the people
in the fact that constitutional government is at stake
this is a fundamental idea
going down about as deep as anything
do not misunderstand me because i have mentioned these objections
they indicate the difficulties that have thus far prevented my action in some such way as you desire
i have not decided against a proclamation of liberty to the slaves
but hold the matter under advisement
and i can assure you that the subject is on my mind by day and night
more than any other
whatever shall appear to be god's will
i will do
i trust that in the freedom with which i have canvassed your views
i have not in any respect injured your feelings
from the annual message to congress
december 1
1862 since your last annual assembling
another year of health and bountiful harvests has passed and while it has not pleased the almighty to bless us with a return of peace
we can but press on
guided by the best light he gives us
trusting that in his own good time and wise way
all will yet be well
the correspondence
touching foreign affairs
which has taken place during the last year
is herewith submitted
in virtual compliance with a request to that effect made by the house of representatives near the close of the last session of congress
if the condition of our relations with other nations is less gratifying than it has usually been at former periods
it is certainly more satisfactory than a nation so unhappily distracted as we are
might reasonably have apprehended
in the month of june last
there were some grounds to expect that the maritime powers
at the beginning of our domestic difficulties
so unwisely and unnecessarily
as we think
recognized the insurgents as a belligerent
would soon recede from that position
which has proved only less injurious to themselves than to our own country
but the temporary reverses which afterward befell the national arms
and which were exaggerated by our own disloyal citizens abroad
have hitherto delayed that act of simple justice
the civil war
which has so radically changed for the moment the occupations and habits of the american people
has necessarily disturbed the social condition and affected very deeply the prosperity of the nations with which we have carried on a commerce that has been steadily increasing throughout a period of half a century
it has
at the same time
excited political ambitions and apprehensions which have produced a profound agitation throughout the civilized world
in this unusual agitation we have forborne from taking part in any controversy between foreign states
and between parties or factions in such states
we have attempted no propagandism and acknowledged no revolution
but we have left to every nation the exclusive conduct and management of its own affairs
our struggle has been
of course
contemplated by foreign nations with reference less to its own merits than to its supposed and often exaggerated effects and consequences resulting to those nations themselves
complaint on the part of this government
even if it were just
would certainly be unwise
there is no line
straight or crooked
suitable for a national boundary
upon which to divide
trace through from east to west upon the line between the free and the slave country
and we shall find a little more than one third of its length are rivers
easy to be crossed
and populated
or soon to be populated
thickly upon both sides while nearly all its remaining length are merely surveyors' lines
over which people may walk back and forth without any consciousness of their presence
no part of this line can be made any more difficult to pass
by writing it down on paper or parchment as a national boundary
the fact of separation
if it comes
gives up
on the part of the seceding section
the fugitive slave clause
along with all other constitutional obligations upon the section seceded from
while i should expect no treaty stipulation would be ever made to take its place
but there is another difficulty
the great interior region bounded east by the alleghanies
north by the british dominions
west by the rocky mountains
and south by the line along which the culture of corn and cotton meets
already has above ten millions of people
and will have fifty millions within fifty years
if not prevented by any political folly or mistake
it contains more than one third of the country owned by the united states
certainly more than one million of square miles
once half as populous as massachusetts already is
and it would have more than seventy five millions of people
a glance at the map shows that
territorially speaking
it is the great body of the republic
the other parts are but marginal borders to it
the magnificent region sloping west from the rocky mountains to the pacific being the deepest
and also the richest
in undeveloped resources
in the production of provisions
and all which proceed from them
this great interior region is naturally one of the most important in the world
ascertain from the statistics the small proportion of the region which has
as yet
been brought into cultivation
and also the large and rapidly increasing amount of its products
and we shall be overwhelmed with the magnitude of the prospect presented
and yet this region has no sea coast
touches no ocean anywhere
as part of one nation
its people now find
and may for ever find
their way to europe by new york
to south america and africa by new orleans
and to asia by san francisco
but separate our common country into two nations
as designed by the present rebellion
and every man of this great interior region is thereby cut off from one or more of these outlets
not perhaps by a physical barrier
but by embarrassing and onerous trade regulations
and this is true
wherever a dividing or boundary line may be fixed
place it between the now free and slave country
or place it south of kentucky
or north of ohio
and still the truth remains that none south of it can trade to any port or place north of it
except upon terms dictated by a government foreign to them
these outlets
and south
are indispensable to the well being of the people inhabiting
and to inhabit
this vast interior region
which of the three may be the best
is no proper question
all are better than either and all of right belong to that people and their successors for ever
true to themselves
they will not ask where a line of separation shall be
but will vow rather that there shall be no such line
nor are the marginal regions less interested in these communications to and through them to the great outside world
they too
and each of them
must have access to this egypt of the west
without paying toll at the crossing of any national boundary
our national strife springs not from our permanent part
not from the land we inhabit
not from our national homestead
there is no possible severing of this but would multiply and not mitigate evils among us
in all its adaptations and aptitudes
it demands union and abhors separation
in fact
it would ere long force reunion
however much of blood and treasure the separation might have cost
we cannot escape history
we of this congress and this administration will be remembered in spite of ourselves
no personal significance or insignificance can spare one or another of us
the fiery trial through which we pass will light us down
in honour or dishonour
to the latest generation
we say we are for the union
the world will not forget that we say this
we know how to save the union
the world knows we do know how to save it
even we here
hold the power and bear the responsibility
in giving freedom to the slave
we assure freedom to the free
honourable alike in what we give and what we preserve
we shall nobly save or meanly lose the last
best hope of earth
other means may succeed this could not fail
the way is plain
a way which
if followed
the world will for ever applaud
and god must for ever bless

july 13
1863 my dear general
i do not remember that you and i ever met personally
i write this now as a grateful acknowledgment for the almost inestimable service you have done the country
i wish to say a word further
when you first reached the vicinity of vicksburg
i thought you should do what you finally did march the troops across the neck
run the batteries with the transports
and thus go below and i never had any faith
except a general hope that you knew better than i
that the yazoo pass expedition and the like could succeed
when you got below and took port gibson
grand gulf
and vicinity
i thought you should go down the river and join general banks
and when you turned northward
east of the big black
i feared it was a mistake
i now wish to make the personal acknowledgment that you were right and i was wrong
yours very truly
letter to moulton
july 31
1863 my dear sir
there has been a good deal of complaint against you by your superior officers of the provost marshal general's department
and your removal has been strongly urged on the ground of persistent disobedience of orders and neglect of duty
firmly convinced
as i am
of the patriotism of your motives
i am unwilling to do anything in your case which may seem unnecessarily harsh or at variance with the feelings of personal respect and esteem with which i have always regarded you
i consider your services in your district valuable
and should be sorry to lose them
it is unnecessary for me to state
that when differences of opinion arise between officers of the government
the ranking officer must be obeyed
you of course recognize as clearly as i do the importance of this rule
i hope you will conclude to go on in your present position under the regulations of the department
i wish you would write to me
letter to mrs
august 8
1863 my dear wife
all as well as usual
and no particular trouble anyway
i put the money into the treasury at five per cent
with the privilege of withdrawing it any time upon thirty days' notice
i suppose you are glad to learn this
tell dear tad poor nanny goat is lost
and mrs
cuthbert and i are in distress about it
the day you left nanny was found resting herself and chewing her little cud on the middle of tad's bed but now she's gone
the gardener kept complaining that she destroyed the flowers
till it was concluded to bring her down to the white house
this was done
and the second day she had disappeared and has not been heard of since
this is the last we know of poor nanny
letter to james h
august 17
1863 my dear sir
months ago i should have acknowledged the receipt of your book and accompanying kind note and i now have to beg your pardon for not having done so
for one of my age i have seen very little of the drama
the first presentation of falstaff i ever saw was yours here
last winter or spring
perhaps the best compliment i can pay is to say
as i truly can
i am very anxious to see it again
some of shakespeare's plays i have never read while others i have gone over perhaps as frequently as any unprofessional reader
among the latter are lear
richard iii
henry viii
and especially macbeth
i think nothing equals macbeth
it is wonderful
unlike you gentlemen of the profession
i think the soliloquy in hamlet commencing oh
my offence is rank
surpasses that commencing to be or not to be
but pardon this small attempt at criticism
i should like to hear you pronounce the opening speech of richard iii
will you not soon visit washington again
if you do
please call and let me make your personal acquaintance
note to secretary stanton

1863 dear sir
i personally wish jacob freese

to be appointed colonel of a coloured regiment
and this regardless of whether he can tell the exact shade of julius c sar's hair
the letter to james c
august 26
1863 your letter inviting me to attend a mass meeting of unconditional union men
to be held at the capital of illinois on the third day of september
has been received
it would be very agreeable to me to thus meet my old friends at my own home
but i cannot just now be absent from here so long as a visit there would require
the meeting is to be of all those who maintain unconditional devotion to the union and i am sure my old political friends will thank me for tendering
as i do
the nation's gratitude to those and other noble men whom no partisan malice or partisan hope can make false to the nation's life
there are those who are dissatisfied with me
to such i would say
you desire peace
and you blame me that we do not have it
but how can we attain it
there are but three conceivable ways
to suppress the rebellion by force of arms
this i am trying to do
are you for it
if you are
so far we are agreed
if you are not for it
a second way is to give up the union
i am against this
are you for it
if you are
you should say so plainly
if you are not for force
nor yet for dissolution
there only remains some imaginable compromise
i do not believe any compromise embracing the maintenance of the union is now possible
all i learn leads to a directly opposite belief
the strength of the rebellion is its military
its army
that army dominates all the country and all the people within its range
any offer of terms made by any man or men within that range
in opposition to that army
is simply nothing for the present
because such man or men have no power whatever to enforce their side of a compromise
if one were made with them
to illustrate
suppose refugees from the south and peace men of the north get together in convention
and frame and proclaim a compromise embracing a restoration of the union
in what way can that compromise be used to keep lee's army out of pennsylvania
meade's army can keep lee's out of pennsylvania
i think
can ultimately drive it out of existence
but no paper compromise
to which the controllers of lee's army are not agreed
can at all affect that army
in an effort at such compromise we should waste time which the enemy would improve to our disadvantage and that would be all
a compromise
to be effective
must be made either with those who control the rebel army
or with the people first liberated from the domination of that army by the success of our own army
allow me to assure you that no word or intimation from that rebel army
or from any of the men controlling it
in relation to any peace compromise
has ever come to my knowledge or belief
all charges and insinuations to the contrary are deceptive and groundless
and i promise you that if any such proposition shall hereafter come
it shall not be rejected and kept a secret from you
i freely acknowledge myself the servant of the people
according to the bond of service
the united states constitution
and that
as such
i am responsible to them
but to be plain
you are dissatisfied with me about the negro
quite likely there is a difference of opinion between you and myself upon that subject
i certainly wish that all men could be free
while i suppose you do not
yet i have neither adopted nor proposed any measure which is not consistent with even your views
provided you are for the union
i suggested compensated emancipation
to which you replied
you wished not to be taxed to buy negroes
but i had not asked you to be taxed to buy negroes
except in such way as to save you from greater taxation to save the union exclusively by other means
you dislike the emancipation proclamation
and perhaps would have it retracted
you say it is unconstitutional
i think differently
i think the constitution invests its commander in chief with the law of war in time of war
the most that can be said if so much is that slaves are property
is there
has there ever been
any question that
by the law of war
both of enemies and friends
may be taken when needed
and is it not needed whenever taking it helps us or hurts the enemy
armies the world over destroy enemies' property when they cannot use it
and even destroy their own to keep it from the enemy
civilized belligerents do all in their power to help themselves or hurt the enemy
except a few things regarded as barbarous or cruel
among the exceptions are the massacre of vanquished foes and non combatants
male and female
but the proclamation
as law
either is valid or is not valid
if it is not valid
it needs no retraction
if it is valid
it cannot be retracted any more than the dead can be brought to life
some of you profess to think its retraction would operate favourably for the union
why better after the retraction than before the issue
there was more than a year and a half of trial to suppress the rebellion before the proclamation issued
the last one hundred days of which passed under an explicit notice that it was coming
unless averted by those in revolt returning to their allegiance
the war has certainly progressed as favourably for us since the issue of the proclamation as before
i know
as fully as one can know the opinions of others
that some of the commanders of our armies in the field who have given us our most important successes
believe the emancipation policy and the use of coloured troops constitute the heaviest blow yet dealt to the rebellion
and that at least one of these important successes could not have been achieved when it was but for the aid of black soldiers
among the commanders holding these views are some who have never had any affinity with what is called abolitionism or with republican party politics
but who hold them purely as military opinions
i submit these opinions as being entitled to some weight against the objections often urged
that emancipation and arming the blacks are unwise as military measures
and were not adopted as such in good faith
you say you will not fight to free negroes
some of them seem willing to fight for you but no matter
fight you
exclusively to save the union
i issued the proclamation on purpose to aid you in saving the union
whenever you shall have conquered all resistance to the union
if i shall urge you to continue fighting
it will be an apt time then for you to declare you will not fight to free negroes
i thought that in your struggle for the union
to whatever extent the negroes should cease helping the enemy
to that extent it weakened the enemy in his resistance to you
do you think differently
i thought that whatever negroes could be got to do as soldiers leaves just so much less for white soldiers to do in saving the union
does it appear otherwise to you
but negroes
like other people
act upon motives
why should they do anything for us
if we will do nothing for them
if they stake their lives for us
they must be prompted by the strongest motive
even the promise of freedom
and the promise being made
must be kept
the signs look better
the father of waters again goes unvexed to the sea
thanks to the great northwest for it
nor yet wholly to them
three hundred miles up they met new england
and jersey hewing their way right and left
the sunny south
in more colours than one
also lent a hand
on the spot
their part of the history was jotted down in black and white
the job was a great national one
and let none be banned who bore an honourable part in it
and while those who cleared the great river may well be proud
even that is not all
it is hard to say that anything has been more bravely and well done than at antietam
and on many fields of lesser note
nor must uncle sam's web feet be forgotten
at all the watery margins they have been present
not only on the deep sea
the broad bay
and the rapid river
but also up the narrow
muddy bayou
and wherever the ground was a little damp
they have been and made their tracks
thanks to all
for the great republic
for the principle it lives by and keeps alive
for man's vast future
thanks to all
peace does not appear so distant as it did
i hope it will come soon
and come to stay and so come as to be worth the keeping in all future time
it will then have been proved that among freemen there can be no successful appeal from the ballot to the bullet
and that they who take such appeal are sure to lose their case and pay the cost
and then there will be some black men who can remember that with silent tongue
and clenched teeth
and steady eye
and well poised bayonet
they have helped mankind on to this great consummation
while i fear there will be some white ones unable to forget that with malignant heart and deceitful speech they strove to hinder it
let us not be over sanguine of a speedy
final triumph
let us be quite sober
let us diligently apply the means
never doubting that a just god
in his own good time
will give us the rightful result
his proclamation for a day of thanksgiving
october 3
1863 the year that is drawing toward its close has been filled with the blessings of fruitful fields and healthful skies
to these bounties
which are so constantly enjoyed that we are prone to forget the source from which they come
others have been added
which are of so extraordinary a nature that they cannot fail to penetrate and soften the heart which is habitually insensible to the ever watchful providence of almighty god
in the midst of a civil war of unequalled magnitude and severity
which has sometimes seemed to foreign states to invite and provoke their aggressions
peace has been preserved with all nations
order has been maintained
the laws have been respected and obeyed
and harmony has prevailed everywhere
except in the theatre of military conflict while that theatre has been greatly contracted by the advancing armies and navies of the union
needful diversions of wealth and strength from the fields of peaceful industry to the national defence have not arrested the plough
the shuttle
or the ship the axe has enlarged the borders of our settlements
and the mines
as well of iron and coal as of the precious metals
have yielded even more abundantly than heretofore
population has steadily increased
notwithstanding the waste that has been made in the camp
the siege
and the battle field and the country
rejoicing in the consciousness of augmented strength and vigour
is permitted to expect continuance of years with large increase of freedom
no human counsel hath devised
nor hath any mortal hand worked out these great things
they are the gracious gifts of the most high god
while dealing with us in anger for our sins
hath nevertheless remembered mercy
it has seemed to me fit and proper that they should be solemnly
and gratefully acknowledged as with one heart and one voice by the whole american people
i do
my fellow citizens in every part of the united states
and also those who are at sea
and those sojourning in foreign lands
to set apart and observe the last thursday of november next as a day of thanksgiving and praise to our beneficent father who dwelleth in the heavens
and i recommend to them that while offering up the ascriptions justly due to him for such singular deliverances and blessings
they do also
with humble penitence for our national perverseness and disobedience
commend to his tender care all those who have become widows
or sufferers in the lamentable civil strife in which we are unavoidably engaged
and fervently implore the interposition of the almighty hand to heal the wounds of the nation
and to restore it
as soon as may be consistent with the divine purposes
to the full enjoyment of peace
and union
address at the dedication of the national cemetery at gettysburg
november 19
1863 fourscore and seven years ago our fathers brought forth upon this continent a new nation
conceived in liberty
and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal
now we are engaged in a great civil war
testing whether that nation
or any nation so conceived and so dedicated
can long endure
we are met on a great battle field of that war
we have come to dedicate a portion of that field as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live
it is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this
but in a larger sense we cannot dedicate
we cannot consecrate
we cannot hallow this ground
the brave men
living and dead
who struggled here
have consecrated it far above our power to add or detract
the world will little note nor long remember what we say here
but it can never forget what they did here
it is for us
the living
to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced
it is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us that from these honoured dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain that this nation
under god
shall have a new birth of freedom and that government of the people
by the people
and for the people
shall not perish from the earth
from the annual message to congress
december 8
when congress assembled a year ago
the war had already lasted nearly twenty months
and there had been many conflicts on both land and sea
with varying results
the rebellion had been pressed back into reduced limits yet the tone of public feeling and opinion at home and abroad was not satisfactory
with other signs
the popular elections then just past indicated uneasiness among ourselves while
amid much that was cold and menacing
the kindest words coming from europe were uttered in accents of pity that we were too blind to surrender a hopeless cause
our commerce was suffering greatly from a few vessels built upon and furnished from foreign shores
and we were threatened with such additions from the same quarter as would sweep our trade from the seas and raise our blockade
we had failed to elicit from european governments anything hopeful upon this subject
the preliminary emancipation proclamation
issued in september
was running its assigned period to the beginning of the new year
a month later the final proclamation came
including the announcement that coloured men of suitable condition would be received into the war service
the policy of emancipation and of employing black soldiers gave to the future a new aspect
about which hope and fear and doubt contended in uncertain conflict
according to our political system
as a matter of civil administration
the general government had no lawful power to effect emancipation in any state
and for a long time it had been hoped that the rebellion could be suppressed without resorting to it as a military measure
it was all the while deemed possible that the necessity for it might come and that
if it should
the crisis of the contest would then be presented
it came
as was anticipated
was followed by dark and doubtful days
eleven months having now passed
we are permitted to take another review
the rebel borders are pressed still farther back
and by the complete opening of the mississippi
the country dominated by the rebellion is divided into distinct parts
with no practical communication between them
tennessee and arkansas have been substantially cleared of insurgent control
and influential citizens in each
owners of slaves and advocates of slavery at the beginning of the rebellion
now declare openly for emancipation in their respective states
of those states not included in the emancipation proclamation
maryland and missouri
neither of which three years ago would tolerate any restraint upon the extension of slavery into new territories
only dispute now as to the best mode of removing it within their own limits
of those who were slaves at the beginning of the rebellion
full one hundred thousand are now in the united states military service
about one half of which number actually bear arms in the ranks thus giving the double advantage of taking so much labour from the insurgent cause and supplying the places which otherwise must be filled with so many white men
so far as tested
it is difficult to say they are not as good soldiers as any
no servile insurrection or tendency to violence or cruelty has marked the measures of emancipation and arming the blacks
these measures have been much discussed in foreign countries
and contemporary with such discussion the tone of public sentiment there is much improved
at home the same measures have been fully discussed
and denounced
and the annual elections following are highly encouraging to those whose official duty it is to bear the country through this great trial
thus we have the new reckoning
the crisis which threatened to divide the friends of the union is passed

1864 my dear sir
a poor widow
by the name of baird
has a son in the army
that for some offence has been sentenced to serve a long time without pay
or at most with very little pay
i do not like this punishment of withholding pay it falls so very hard upon poor families
after he had been serving in this way for several months
at the tearful appeal of the poor mother
i made a direction that he be allowed to enlist for a new term
on the same condition as others
she now comes
and says she cannot get it acted upon
please do it

1864 my dear sir
i congratulate you on having fixed your name in history as the first free state governor of louisiana
now you are about to have a convention
among other things
will probably define the elective franchise
i barely suggest for your private consideration
whether some of the coloured people may not be let in as
for instance
the very intelligent
and especially those who have fought gallantly in our ranks
they would probably help
in some trying time to come
to keep the jewel of liberty within the family of freedom
but this is only a suggestion
not to the public
but to you alone
an address at a fair for the sanitary commission
march 18
1864 i appear to say but a word
this extraordinary war in which we are engaged falls heavily upon all classes of people
but the most heavily upon the soldier
for it has been said
all that a man hath will he give for his life and while all contribute of their substance
the soldier puts his life at stake
and often yields it up in his country's cause
the highest merit
is due to the soldier
in this extraordinary war extraordinary developments have manifested themselves
such as have not been seen in former wars and amongst these manifestations nothing has been more remarkable than these fairs for the relief of suffering soldiers and their families
and the chief agents in these fairs are the women of america
i am not accustomed to the language of eulogy
i have never studied the art of paying compliments to women
but i must say
that if all that has been said by orators and poets since the creation of the world in praise of women were applied to the women of america
it would not do them justice for their conduct during this war
i will close by saying
god bless the women of america
letter to a
of kentucky
april 4
1864 i am naturally anti slavery
if slavery is not wrong
nothing is wrong
i cannot remember when i did not so think and feel
and yet i have never understood that the presidency conferred upon me an unrestricted right to act officially upon this judgment and feeling
it was in the oath that i took
that i would
to the best of my ability
and defend the constitution of the united states
i could not take office without taking the oath
nor was it my view that i might take an oath to get power
and break the oath in using the power
i understood
that in ordinary civil administration this oath even forbade me to practically indulge my primary abstract judgment on the moral question of slavery
i had publicly declared this many times and in many ways
and i aver that
to this day
i have done no official act in mere deference to my abstract feeling and judgment on slavery
i did understand
that my oath to preserve the constitution to the best of my ability imposed upon me the duty of preserving
by every indispensable means
that government that nation of which that constitution was the organic law
was it possible to lose the nation and yet preserve the constitution
by general law
life and limb must be protected
yet often a limb must be amputated to save a life but a life is never wisely given to save a limb
i felt that measures
otherwise unconstitutional
might become lawful by becoming indispensable to the preservation of the constitution through the preservation of the nation
right or wrong
i assumed this ground and now avow it
i could not feel that
to the best of my ability
i had even tried to preserve the constitution
to save slavery or any minor matter
i should permit the wreck of government
and constitution
all together
early in the war
general fremont attempted military emancipation
i forbade it
because i did not then think it an indispensable necessity
a little later
general cameron
then secretary of war
suggested the arming of the blacks
i objected
because i did not think it an indispensable necessity
still later
general hunter attempted military emancipation
i again forbade it
because i did not yet think the indispensable necessity had come
in march and may and july
i made earnest and successive appeals to the border states to favour compensated emancipation
i believed the indispensable necessity for military emancipation and arming the blacks would come
unless averted by that measure
they declined the proposition
and i was
in my best judgment
driven to the alternative of either surrendering the union
and with it the constitution
or laying strong hand upon the coloured element
i chose the latter
in choosing it
i hoped for greater gain than loss but of this i was not entirely confident
more than a year of trial now shows no loss by it in our foreign relations
none in our home popular sentiment
none in our white military force
no loss by it anyhow or anywhere
on the contrary
it shows a gain of quite one hundred and thirty thousand soldiers
and labourers
these are palpable facts
about which
as facts
there can be no cavilling
we have the men
and we could not have had them without the measure
and now let any union man who complains of the measure
test himself by writing down in one line that he is for subduing the rebellion by force of arms and in the next
that he is for taking these hundred and thirty thousand men from the union side
and placing them where they would be but for the measure he condemns
if he cannot face his case so stated
it is only because he cannot face the truth
i add a word which was not in the verbal conversation
in telling this tale
i attempt no compliment to my own sagacity
i claim not to have controlled events
but confess plainly that events have controlled me
at the end of three years' struggle
the nation's condition is not what either party
or any man
devised or expected
god alone can claim it
whither it is tending seems plain
if god now wills the removal of a great wrong
and wills also that we of the north
as well as you of the south
shall pay fairly for our complicity in that wrong
impartial history will find therein new cause to attest and revere the justice and goodness of god
from an address at a sanitary fair in baltimore
april 18
the world has never had a good definition of the word liberty
and the american people
just now
are much in want of one
we all declare for liberty but in using the same word
we do not all mean the same thing
with some
the word liberty may mean for each man to do as he pleases with himself and the product of his labour while with others
the same word may mean for some men to do as they please with other men and the product of other men's labour
here are two
not only different
but incompatible things
called by the same name
and it follows that each of the things is
by the respective parties
called by two different and incompatible names
liberty and tyranny
the shepherd drives the wolf from the sheep's throat
for which the sheep thanks the shepherd as his liberator
while the wolf denounces him for the same act as the destroyer of liberty
especially as the sheep was a black one
the sheep and the wolf are not agreed upon a definition of the word liberty and precisely the same difference prevails to day
among us human creatures
even in the north
and all professing to love liberty
hence we behold the process by which thousands are daily passing from under the yoke of bondage hailed by some as the advance of liberty
and bewailed by others as the destruction of all liberty
as it seems
the people of maryland have been doing something to define liberty
and thanks to them that
in what they have done
the wolf's dictionary has been repudiated

1864 not expecting to see you again before the spring campaign opens
i wish to express in this way my entire satisfaction with what you have done up to this time
so far as i understand it
the particulars of your plans i neither know nor seek to know
you are vigilant and self reliant and
pleased with this
i wish not to obtrude any constraints nor restraints upon you
while i am very anxious that any great disaster or capture of our men in great numbers shall be avoided
i know these points are less likely to escape your attention than they would be mine
if there is anything wanting which is within my power to give
do not fail to let me know it
and now

august 22
1864 i almost always feel inclined
when i happen to say anything to soldiers
to impress upon them
in a few brief remarks
the importance of success in this contest
it is not merely for to day
but for all time to come
that we should perpetuate for our children's children that great and free government which we have enjoyed all our lives
i beg you to remember this
not merely for my sake
but for yours
i happen
to occupy this white house
i am a living witness that any one of your children may look to come here as my father's child has
it is in order that each one of you may have
through this free government which we have enjoyed
an open field and a fair chance for your industry
and intelligence that you may all have equal privileges in the race of life
with all its desirable human aspirations
it is for this the struggle should be maintained
that we may not lose our birthright not only for one
but for two or three years
the nation is worth fighting for
to secure such an inestimable jewel
reply to a serenade
november 10
1864 it has long been a grave question whether any government not too strong for the liberties of its people
can be strong enough to maintain its existence in great emergencies
on this point the present rebellion brought our republic to a severe test and a presidential election
occurring in regular course during the rebellion
added not a little to the strain
if the loyal people united were put to the utmost of their strength by the rebellion
must they not fail when divided and partially paralyzed by a political war among themselves
but the election was a necessity
we cannot have free government without elections and if the rebellion could force us to forego or postpone a national election
it might fairly claim to have already conquered and ruined us
the strife of the election is but human nature practically applied to the facts of the case
what has occurred in this case must ever occur in similar cases
human nature will not change
in any future great national trial
compared with the men of this
we shall have as weak and as strong
as silly and as wise
as bad and as good
let us
study the incidents of this as philosophy to learn wisdom from
and none of them as wrongs to be revenged
but the election
along with its incidental and undesirable strife
has done good too
it has demonstrated that a people's government can sustain a national election in the midst of a great civil war
gold is good in its place
but living
patriotic men are better than gold
but the rebellion continues and now that the election is over
may not all having a common interest reunite in a common effort to save our common country
for my own part
i have striven and shall strive to avoid placing any obstacle in the way
so long as i have been here
i have not willingly planted a thorn in any man's bosom
while i am deeply sensible to the high compliment of a re election
and duly grateful as i trust to almighty god for having directed my countrymen to a right conclusion
as i think
for their own good
it adds nothing to my satisfaction that any other man may be disappointed or pained by the result
may i ask those who have not differed with me
to join with me in this same spirit towards those who have
and now let me close by asking three hearty cheers for our brave soldiers and seamen
and their gallant and skilful commanders

november 21
1864 dear madam
i have been shown in the files of the war department a statement of the adjutant general of massachusetts that you are the mother of five sons who have died gloriously on the field of battle
i feel how weak and fruitless must be any words of mine which should attempt to beguile you from the grief of a loss so overwhelming
but i cannot refrain from tendering to you the consolation that may be found in the thanks of the republic they died to save
i pray that our heavenly father may assuage the anguish of your bereavement
and leave you only the cherished memory of the loved and lost
and the solemn pride that must be yours to have laid so costly a sacrifice upon the altar of freedom
yours very sincerely and respectfully

1865 please read and answer this letter as though i was not president
but only a friend
my son
now in his twenty second year
having graduated at harvard
wishes to see something of the war before it ends
i do not wish to put him in the ranks
nor yet to give him a commission
to which those who have already served long are better entitled
and better qualified to hold
could he
without embarrassment to you or detriment to the service
go into your military family with some nominal rank
and not the public
furnishing his necessary means
if no
say so without the least hesitation
because i am as anxious and as deeply interested that you shall not be encumbered as you can be yourself
the second inaugural address
march 4
1865 fellow countrymen
at this second appearance to take the oath of the presidential office
there is less occasion for an extended address than there was at the first
then a statement
somewhat in detail
of a course to be pursued
seemed fitting and proper
at the expiration of four years
during which public declarations have been constantly called forth on every point and phase of the great contest which still absorbs the attention and engrosses the energies of the nation
little that is new could be presented
the progress of our arms
upon which all else chiefly depends
is as well known to the public as to myself and it is
i trust
reasonably satisfactory and encouraging to all
with high hope for the future
no prediction in regard to it is ventured
on the occasion corresponding to this four years ago
all thoughts were anxiously directed to an impending civil war
all dreaded it
all sought to avert it
while the inaugural address was being delivered from this place
devoted altogether to saving the union without war
insurgent agents were in the city seeking to destroy it without war
seeking to dissolve the union
and divide effects
by negotiation
both parties deprecated war but one of them would make war rather than let the nation survive
and the other would accept war rather than let it perish
and the war came
one eighth of the whole population were coloured slaves
not distributed generally over the union
but localized in the southern part of it
these slaves constituted a peculiar and powerful interest
all knew that this interest was
the cause of the war
to strengthen
and extend this interest was the object for which the insurgents would rend the union
even by war while the government claimed no right to do more than to restrict the territorial enlargement of it
with malice toward none with charity for all with firmness in the right
as god gives us to see the right
let us strive on to finish the work we are in
to bind up the nation's wounds to care for him who shall have borne the battle
and for his widow and his orphan to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves
and with all nations

1865 dear mr
every one likes a compliment
thank you for yours on my little notification speech and on the recent inaugural address
i expect the latter to wear as well as perhaps better than anything i have produced but i believe it is not immediately popular
men are not flattered by being shown that there has been a difference of purpose between the almighty and them
to deny it
in this case
is to deny that there is a god governing the world
it is a truth which i thought needed to be told
as whatever of humiliation there is in it falls most directly on myself
i thought others might afford for me to tell it
truly yours
from an address to an indiana regiment
march 17
1865 there are but few aspects of this great war on which i have not already expressed my views by speaking or writing
there is one the recent effort of our erring brethren
sometimes so called
to employ the slaves in their armies
the great question with them has been
will the negro fight for them
they ought to know better than we
and doubtless do know better than we
i may incidentally remark
that having in my life heard many arguments or strings of words meant to pass for arguments intended to show that the negro ought to be a slave
if he shall now really fight to keep himself a slave
it will be a far better argument why he should remain a slave than i have ever before heard
ought to be a slave if he desires it ardently enough to fight for it
if one out of four will
for his own freedom fight to keep the other three in slavery
he ought to be a slave for his selfish meanness
i have always thought that all men should be free but if any should be slaves
it should be first those who desire it for themselves
and secondly those who desire it for others
whenever i hear any one arguing for slavery
i feel a strong impulse to see it tried on him personally
from his reply to a serenade
lincoln's last public address
april 11
1865 fellow citizens
we meet this evening
not in sorrow but in gladness of heart
the evacuation of richmond and petersburg
and the surrender of the principal insurgent army
give the hope of a just and speedy peace
the joyous expression of which cannot be restrained
in all this joy
he from whom all blessings flow must not be forgotten
a call for a national thanksgiving is in the course of preparation
and will be duly promulgated
nor must those whose harder part give us the cause for rejoicing be overlooked
their honours must not be parcelled out with others
was near the front
and had the high pleasure of transmitting much of the good news to you but no part of the honour for plan or execution is mine
to general grant
his skilful officers and brave men
all belongs
the gallant navy stood ready
but was not in reach to take an active part
by these recent successes the reinauguration of the national authority
which has had a large share of thought from the first
is pressed much more closely upon our attention
it is fraught with great difficulty
unlike a case of war between independent nations
there is no organized organ for us to treat with
no one man has authority to give up the rebellion for any other man
we simply must begin with and mould from disorganized and discordant elements
nor is it a small additional embarrassment that we
the loyal people
differ among ourselves as to the mode
and measure of reconstruction
as a general rule i abstain from reading the reports of attacks upon myself
wishing not to be provoked by that to which i cannot properly offer an answer
in spite of this precaution
it comes to my knowledge that i am much censured for some supposed agency in setting up and seeking to sustain the new state government of louisiana
in this i have done just so much as
and no more than
the public knows
in the annual message of december 1863
and in the accompanying proclamation
i presented a plan of reconstruction
as the phrase goes
which i promised
if adopted by any state
should be acceptable to and sustained by the executive government of the nation
i distinctly stated that this was not the only plan which might possibly be acceptable
and i also distinctly protested that the executive claimed no right to say when or whether members should be admitted to seats in congress from such states
this plan was in advance submitted to the then cabinet
and approved by every member of it
when the message of 1863
with the plan before mentioned
reached new orleans
general banks wrote me that he was confident that the people
with his military co operation
would reconstruct substantially on that plan
i wrote him and some of them to try it
they tried it
and the result is known
such has been my only agency in getting up the louisiana government
as to sustaining it
my promise is out
as before stated
but as bad promises are better broken than kept
i shall treat this as a bad promise and break it
whenever i shall be convinced that keeping it is adverse to the public interest but i have not yet been so convinced
i have been shown a letter on this subject
supposed to be an able one
in which the writer expresses regret that my mind has not seemed to be definitely fixed upon the question whether the seceded states
so called
are in the union or out of it
it would perhaps add astonishment to his regret were he to learn that since i have found professed union men endeavouring to answer that question
i have purposely forborne any public expression upon it
we all agree that the seceded states
so called
are out of their proper practical relation with the union
and that the sole object of the government
civil and military
in regard to those states
is to again get them into that proper practical relation
i believe that it is not only possible
but in fact easier
to do this without deciding or even considering whether these states have ever been out of the union
than with it
finding themselves safely at home
it would be utterly immaterial whether they had ever been abroad
let us all join in doing the acts necessary to restoring the proper practical relations between these states and the union
and each for ever after innocently indulge his own opinion whether in doing the acts he brought the states from without into the union
or only gave them proper assistance
they never having been out of it
the amount of constituency
so to speak
on which the new louisiana government rests
would be more satisfactory to all if it contained forty thousand
or thirty thousand
or even twenty thousand
instead of only about twelve thousand as it does
it is also unsatisfactory to some that the elective franchise is not given to the coloured man
i would myself prefer that it were now conferred on the very intelligent
and on those who serve our cause as soldiers
the question is not whether the louisiana government
as it stands
is quite all that is desirable
the question is
will it be wiser to take it as it is and help to improve it
or to reject and disperse it
can louisiana be brought into proper practical relation with the union sooner by sustaining or by discarding her new state government
some twelve thousand voters in the heretofore slave state of louisiana have sworn allegiance to the union
assumed to be the rightful political power of the state
held elections
organized a state government
adopted a free state constitution
giving the benefit of public schools equally to black and white
and empowering the legislature to confer the elective franchise upon the coloured man
their legislature has already voted to ratify the constitutional amendment recently passed by congress
abolishing slavery throughout the nation
these twelve thousand persons are thus fully committed to the union and to perpetual freedom in the state
committed to the very things
and nearly all the things
the nation wants
and they ask the nation's recognition and its assistance to make good their committal
if we reject and spurn them
we do our utmost to disorganize and disperse them
in effect
say to the white man
you are worthless or worse we will neither help you
nor be helped by you
to the blacks
we say
this cup of liberty
which these
your old masters
hold to your lips
we will dash from you
and leave you to the chances of gathering the spilled and scattered contents in some vague and undefined when
and how
if this course
discouraging and paralyzing both white and black
has any tendency to bring louisiana into proper
practical relations with the union
i have so far been unable to perceive it
on the contrary
we recognize and sustain the new government of louisiana
the converse of all this is made true
we encourage the hearts and nerve the arms of twelve thousand to adhere to their work
and argue for it
and proselyte for it
and fight for it
and feed it
and grow it
and ripen it to a complete success
the coloured man
in seeing all united for him
is inspired with vigilance
and energy
and daring to the same end
grant that he desires the elective franchise
will he not attain it sooner by saving the already advanced steps towards it
than by running backward over them
i repeat the question
can louisiana be brought into proper practical relation with the union sooner by sustaining or by discarding her new state government
what has been said of louisiana will apply generally to other states
and yet so great peculiarities pertain to each state
and such important and sudden changes occur in the same state
and withal so new and unprecedented is the whole case
that no exclusive and inflexible plan can safely be prescribed as to details and collaterals
such exclusive and inflexible plan would surely become a new entanglement
important principles may and must be inflexible
in the present situation
as the phrase goes
it may be my duty to make some new announcement to the people of the south
i am considering
and shall not fail to act when satisfied that action will be proper
appendix anecdotes lincoln's entry into richmond the day after it was taken as described at that time by a writer in the atlantic monthly they gathered around the president
ran ahead
hovered about the flanks of the little company
and hung like a dark cloud upon the rear
women and children joined the constantly increasing throng
they came from all the by streets
running in breathless haste
shouting and hallooing
and dancing with delight
the men threw up their hats
the women waved their bonnets and handkerchiefs
clapped their hands
and sang
glory to god
rendering all the praise to god
who had heard their wailings in the past
their moanings for wives
and friends sold out of their sight had given them freedom
and after long years of waiting had permitted them thus unexpectedly to behold the face of their great benefactor
i thank you
dear jesus
that i behold president linkum
was the exclamation of a woman who stood upon the threshold of her humble home
and with streaming eyes and clasped hands gave thanks aloud to the saviour of men
more demonstrative in her joy
was jumping and striking her hands with all her might
bless de lord
bless de lord
bless de lord
as if there could be no end to her thanksgiving
the air rang with a tumultuous chorus of voices
the street became almost impassable on account of the increasing multitude
till soldiers were summoned to clear the way
the walk was long
and the president halted a moment to rest
may de good lord bless you
president linkum
said an old negro
removing his hat and bowing
with tears of joy rolling down his cheeks
the president removed his own hat
and bowed in silence but it was a bow which upset the forms
and ceremonies of centuries
it was a death shock to chivalry and a mortal wound to caste
recognize a nigger
a woman in an adjoining house beheld it
and turned from the scene in unspeakable disgust
the following nine anecdotes were related by frank b
the painter

you don't wear hoops and i will
pardon your brother a distinguished citizen of ohio had an appointment with the president one evening at six o'clock
as he entered the vestibule of the white house
his attention was attracted by a poorly clad young woman who was violently sobbing
he asked her the cause of her distress
she said she had been ordered away by the servants after vainly waiting many hours to see the president about her only brother
who had been condemned to death
her story was this
she and her brother were foreigners
and orphans
they had been in this country several years
her brother enlisted in the army
through bad influences
was induced to desert
he was captured
tried and sentenced to be shot the old story
the poor girl had obtained the signatures of some persons who had formerly known him
to a petition for a pardon
and alone had come to washington to lay the case before the president
thronged as the waiting rooms always were
she had passed the long hours of two days trying in vain to get an audience
and had at length been ordered away
the gentleman's feelings were touched
he said to her that he had come to see the president
but did not know as he should succeed
he told her
to follow him upstairs
and he would see what could be done for her
just before reaching the door
lincoln came out
and meeting his friend said good humouredly
are you not ahead of time
the gentleman showed him his watch
with the hand upon the hour of six
returned mr
i have been so busy to day that i have not had time to get a lunch
go in
and sit down i will be back directly
the gentleman made the young woman accompany him into the office
when they were seated
said to her
my good girl
i want you to muster all the courage you have in the world
when the president comes back
he will sit down in that arm chair
i shall get up to speak to him
and as i do so you must force yourself between us
and insist upon the examination of your papers
telling him it is a case of life and death
and admits of no delay
these instructions were carried out to the letter
lincoln was at first somewhat surprised at the apparent forwardness of the young woman
but observing her distressed appearance
he ceased conversation with his friend
and commenced an examination of the document she had placed in his hands
glancing from it to the face of the petitioner
whose tears had broken forth afresh
he studied its expression for a moment
and then his eye fell upon her scanty but neat dress
instantly his face lighted up
my poor girl
said he
you have come here with no governor
or senator
or member of congress
to plead your cause
you seem honest and truthful and you don't wear hoops and i will be whipped but i will pardon your brother
his joy in giving a pardon one night schuyler colfax left all other business to ask him to respite the son of a constituent
who was sentenced to be shot
at davenport
for desertion
he heard the story with his usual patience
though he was wearied out with incessant calls
and anxious for rest
and then replied
some of our generals complain that i impair discipline and subordination in the army by my pardons and respites
but it makes me rested
after a hard day's work
if i can find some good excuse for saving a man's life
and i go to bed happy as i think how joyous the signing of my name will make him and his family and his friends
and with a happy smile beaming over that care furrowed face
he signed that name that saved that life
his simplicity and unostentatiousness the simplicity and absence of all ostentation on the part of mr
is well illustrated by an incident which occurred on the occasion of a visit he made to commodore porter
at fortress monroe
noticing that the banks of the river were dotted with flowers
he said
tad the pet name for his youngest son
who had accompanied him on the excursion is very fond of flowers won't you let a couple of men take a boat and go with him for an hour or two
along the banks of the river
and gather the flowers
look at this picture
and then endeavour to imagine the head of a european nation making a similar request
in this humble way
of one of his subordinates
a penitent man can be pardoned one day i took a couple of friends from new york upstairs
who wished to be introduced to the president
it was after the hour for business calls
and we found him alone
for once
at leisure
soon after the introduction
one of my friends took occasion to indorse
very decidedly
the president's amnesty proclamation
which had been severely censured by many friends of the administration
s 's approval touched mr
he said
with a great deal of emphasis
and with an expression of countenance i shall never forget
when a man is sincerely penitent for his misdeeds
and gives satisfactory evidence of the same
he can safely be pardoned
and there is no exception to the rule
keep silence
and we'll get you safe across at the white house one day some gentlemen were present from the west
excited and troubled about the commissions and omissions of the administration
the president heard them patiently
and then replied
suppose all the property you were worth was in gold
and you had put it in the hands of blondin to carry across the niagara river on a rope
would you shake the cable
or keep shouting out to him
stand up a little straighter blondin
stoop a little more go a little faster lean a little more to the north lean a little more to the south
 no
you would hold your breath as well as your tongue
and keep your hands off until he was safe over
the government are carrying an immense weight
untold treasures are in their hands
they are doing the very best they can
don't badger them
keep silence
and we'll get you safe across
rebuff to a man with a small claim during a public reception
a farmer
from one of the border counties of virginia
told the president that the union soldiers
in passing his farm
had helped themselves not only to hay
but his horse
and he hoped the president would urge the proper officer to consider his claim immediately
lincoln said that this reminded him of an old acquaintance of his
jack chase
who used to be a lumberman on the illinois
a steady
sober man
and the best raftsman on the river
it was quite a trick
twenty five years ago
to take the logs over the rapids but he was skilful with a raft
and always kept her straight in the channel
finally a steamer was put on
and jack was made captain of her
he always used to take the wheel going through the rapids
one day when the boat was plunging and wallowing along the boiling current
and jack's utmost vigilance was being exercised to keep her in the narrow channel
a boy pulled his coat tail
and hailed him with
mister captain
i wish you would just stop your boat a minute i've lost my apple overboard
the president's silence over criticisms the president was once speaking about an attack made on him by the committee on the conduct of the war for a certain alleged blunder
or something worse
in the southwest the matter involved being one which had fallen directly under the observation of the officer to whom he was talking
who possessed official evidence completely upsetting all the conclusions of the committee
might it not be well for me
queried the officer
to set this matter right in a letter to some paper
stating the facts as they actually transpired
oh
replied the president
at least
not now
if i were to try to read
much less answer
all the attacks made on me
this shop might as well be closed for any other business
i do the very best i know how the very best i can and i mean to keep doing so until the end
if the end brings me out all right
what is said against me won't amount to anything
if the end brings me out wrong
ten angels swearing i was right would make no difference
glad of it on the occasion when the telegram from cumberland gap reached mr
lincoln that firing was heard in the direction of knoxville
he remarked that he was glad of it
some person present
who had the perils of burnside's position uppermost in his mind
not see why mr
lincoln should be glad of it
and so expressed himself
you see
responded the president
it reminds me of mistress sallie ward
a neighbour of mine
who had a very large family
occasionally one of her numerous progeny would be heard crying in some out of the way place
upon which mrs
ward would exclaim
there's one of my children that isn't dead yet
 his democratic bearing the evening before i left washington an incident occurred
illustrating very perfectly the character of the man
for two days my large painting had been on exhibition
upon its completion
in the east room
which had been thronged with visitors
late in the afternoon of the second day
the black horse cavalry escort drew up as usual in front of the portico
preparatory to the president's leaving for the soldiers' home
where he spent the midsummer nights
while the carriage was waiting
i looked around for him
wishing to say a farewell word
knowing that i should have no other opportunity
presently i saw him standing halfway between the portico and the gateway leading to the war department
leaning against the iron fence one arm thrown over the railing
and one foot on the stone coping which supports it
evidently having been intercepted
on his way in from the war department
by a plain looking man
who was giving him
very diffidently
an account of a difficulty which he had been unable to have rectified
while waiting
i walked out leisurely to the president's side
he said very little to the man
but was intently studying the expression of his face while he was narrating his trouble
when he had finished
lincoln said to him
have you a blank card
the man searched his pockets
but finding none
a gentleman standing near
who had overheard the question
came forward
and said
here is one
several persons had
in the meantime
gathered around
taking the card and a pencil
lincoln sat down upon the stone coping
which is not more than five or six inches above the pavement
presenting almost the appearance of sitting upon the pavement itself
and wrote an order upon the card to the proper official to examine this man's case
while writing this
i observed several persons passing down the promenade
smiling at each other
at what i presume they thought the undignified appearance of the head of the nation
seemed utterly unconscious
either of any impropriety in the action
or of attracting any attention
to me it was not only a touching picture of the native goodness of the man
but of innate nobility of character
exemplified not so much by a disregard of conventionalities
as in unconsciousness that there could be any breach of etiquette
or dignity
in the manner of an honest attempt to serve
or secure justice to a citizen of the republic
however humble he may be

1863 1865 1863 opinion on the loss of general r
milroy's division
october 27
in june last a division was substantially lost at or near winchester
at the time
it was under general milroy as immediate commander in the field
general schenck as department commander at baltimore
and general halleck as general in chief at washington
general milroy
as immediate commander
was put in arrest
and subsequently a court of inquiry examined chiefly with reference to disobedience of orders
and reported the evidence
the foregoing is a synoptical statement of the evidence
together with the judge advocate general's conclusions
the disaster
when it came
was a surprise to all
it was very well known to generals shenck and milroy for some time before
that general halleck thought the division was in great danger of a surprise at winchester that it was of no service commensurate with the risk it incurred
and that it ought to be withdrawn but
although he more than once advised its withdrawal
he never positively ordered it
general schenck
on the contrary
believed the service of the force at winchester was worth the hazard
and so did not positively order its withdrawal until it was so late that the enemy cut the wire and prevented the order reaching general milroy
general milroy seems to have concurred with general schenck in the opinion that the force should be kept at winchester at least until the approach of danger
but he disobeyed no order upon the subject
some question can be made whether some of general halleck's dispatches to general schenk should not have been construed to be orders to withdraw the force
and obeyed accordingly but no such question can be made against general milroy
in fact
the last order he received was to be prepared to withdraw
but not to actually withdraw until further order
which further order never reached him
serious blame is not necessarily due to any serious disaster
and i cannot say that in this case any of the officers are deserving of serious blame
no court martial is deemed necessary or proper in the case

there have recently reached the war department
and thence been laid before me
from missouri
three communications
all similar in import and identical in object
one of them
addressed to nobody
and without place or date
but having the signature of apparently the writer
is a letter of eight closely written foolscap pages
the other two are written by a different person
at st
and of the dates
october 12 and 13
and each inclosing a large number of affidavits
the general statements of the whole are that the federal and state authorities are arming the disloyal and disarming the loyal
and that the latter will all be killed or driven out of the state unless there shall be a change
in particular
no loyal man who has been disarmed is named
but the affidavits show by name forty two persons as disloyal who have been armed
they are as follows
the names are omitted
a majority of these are shown to have been in the rebel service
i believe it could be shown that the government here has deliberately armed more than ten times as many captured at gettysburg
to say nothing of similar operations in east tennessee
these papers contain altogether thirty one manuscript pages
and one newspaper in extenso
and yet i do not find it anywhere charged in them that any loyal man has been harmed by reason of being disarmed
or that any disloyal one has harmed anybody by reason of being armed by the federal or state government
of course
i have not had time to carefully examine all but i have had most of them examined and briefed by others
and the result is as stated
the remarkable fact that the actual evil is yet only anticipated inferred induces me to suppose i understand the case but i do not state my impression
because i might be mistaken
and because your duty and mine is plain in any event
the locality of nearly all this seems to be st
joseph and buchanan county
i wish you to give special attention to this region
particularly on election day
prevent violence from whatever quarter
and see that the soldiers themselves do no wrong

my dear sir
the above act of congress was passed

for the purpose of shutting out improper applicants for seats in the house of representatives and i fear there is some danger that it will be used to shut out proper ones
having an entire union delegation

if upon any

consult with the governor

the provost marshal general has issued no proclamation at all
he has in no form announced anything recently in regard to troops in new york
except in his letter to governor seymour of october 21
which has been published in the newspapers of that state
it has not been announced or decided in any form by the provost marshal general
or any one else in authority of the government
that every citizen who has paid his three hundred dollars commutation is liable to be immediately drafted again
or that towns that have just raised the money to pay their quotas will have again to be subject to similar taxation or suffer the operations of the new conscription
nor it is probable that the like of them ever will be announced or decided

montgomery blair
my dear sir
some days ago i understood you to say that your brother
general frank blair
desires to be guided by my wishes as to whether he will occupy his seat in congress or remain in the field
my wish
is compounded of what i believe will be best for the country and it is that he will come here
put his military commission in my hands
take his seat
go into caucus with our friends
abide the nominations
help elect the nominees
and thus aid to organize a house of representatives which will really support the government in the war
if the result shall be the election of himself as speaker
let him serve in that position
if not
let him retake his commission and return to the army for the benefit of the country
this will heal a dangerous schism for him
it will relieve him from a dangerous position or a misunderstanding
as i think he is in danger of being permanently separated from those with whom only he can ever have a real sympathy the sincere opponents of slavery
it will be a mistake if he shall allow the provocations offered him by insincere time servers to drive him from the house of his own building
he is young yet
he has abundant talents quite enough to occupy all his time without devoting any to temper
he is rising in military skill and usefulness
his recent appointment to the command of a corps
by one so competent to judge as general sherman
proves this
in that line he can serve both the country and himself more profitably than he could as a member of congress upon the floor
the foregoing is what i would say if frank blair was my brother instead of yours
yours truly

his excellency a
governor of maryland
yours of the 31st ult
was received yesterday about noon
and since then i have been giving most earnest attention to the subject matter of it
at my call general schenck has attended
and he assures me it is almost certain that violence will be used at some of the voting places on election day unless prevented by his provost guards
he says that at some of those places union voters will not attend at all
or run a ticket
unless they have some assurance of protection
this makes the missouri case
of my action in regard to which you express your approval
the remaining point of your letter is a protest against any person offering to vote being put to any test not found in the laws of maryland
this brings us to a difference between missouri and maryland
with the same reason in both states
missouri has
by law
provided a test for the voter with reference to the present rebellion
while maryland has not
for example
general trimble
captured fighting us at gettysburg
without recanting his treason
a legal voter by the laws of maryland
even general schenck's order admits him to vote
if he recants upon oath
i think that is cheap enough
my order in missouri
which you approve
and general scherick's order here
reach precisely the same end
bach assures the right of voting to all loyal men
and whether a man is loyal
each allows that man to fix by his own oath
your suggestion that nearly all the candidates are loyal
i do not think quite meets the case
in this struggle for the nation's life
i cannot so confidently rely on those whose elections may have depended upon disloyal votes
such men
when elected
may prove true but such votes are given them in the expectation that they will prove false
nor do i think that to keep the peace at the polls
and to prevent the persistently disloyal from voting
constitutes just cause of offense to maryland
i think she has her own example for it
if i mistake not
it is precisely what general dix did when your excellency was elected governor
i revoke the first of the three propositions in general schenek's general order no
53 not that it is wrong in principle
but because the military
being of necessity exclusive judges as to who shall be arrested
the provision is too liable to abuse
for the revoked part i substitute the following
all provost marshals and other military officers do prevent all disturbance and violence at or about the polls
whether offered by such persons as above described
or by any other person or persons whomsoever
the other two propositions of the order i allow to stand
general schenek is fully determined
and has my strict orders besides
that all loyal men may vote
and vote for whom they please
your obedient servant

four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent
a new nation
conceived in liberty
and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal
now we are engaged in a great civil war
testing whether that nation or any nation so conceived and so dedicated
can long endure
we are met on a great battle field of that war
we have come to dedicate a portion of that field
as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live
it is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this
in a larger sense
we can not dedicate we can not consecrate we can not hallow this ground
the brave men
living and dead
who struggled here
have consecrated it
far above our poor power to add or detract
the world will little note
nor long remember what we say here
but it can never forget what they did here
it is for us the living
to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced
it is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain that this nation
under god
shall have a new birth of freedom and that government of the people
by the people
for the people
shall not perish from the earth

reliable information being received that the insurgent force is retreating from east tennessee
under circumstances rendering it probable that the union forces cannot hereafter be dislodged from that important position and esteeming this to be of high national consequence

proclamation of amnesty and reconstruction
december 8
by the president of the united states of america
a proclamation
whereas in and by the constitution of the united states it is provided that the president shall have power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the united states
except in cases of impeachment and
whereas a rebellion now exists whereby the loyal state governments of several states have for a long time been subverted
and many persons have committed and are now guilty of treason against the united states and whereas
with reference to said rebellion and treason
laws have been enacted by congress declaring forfeitures and confiscation of property and liberation of slaves
all upon terms and conditions therein stated
and also declaring that the president was thereby authorized at any time thereafter
by proclamation
to extend to persons who may have participated in the existing rebellion in any state or part thereof pardon and amnesty
with such exceptions and at such times and on such conditions as he may deem expedient for the public welfare and whereas the congressional declaration for limited and conditional pardon accords with well established judicial exposition of the pardoning power and whereas
with reference to said rebellion
the president of the united states has issued several proclamations with provisions in regard to the liberation of slaves and whereas it is now desired by some persons heretofore engaged in said rebellion to resume their allegiance to the united states and to reinaugurate loyal state governments within and for their respective states
abraham lincoln
president of the united states
do proclaim
and make known to all persons who have
directly or by implication
participated in the existing rebellion
except as hereinafter excepted
that a full pardon is hereby granted to them and each of them
with restoration of all rights of property
except as to slaves and in property cases where rights of third parties shall have intervened
and upon the condition that every such person shall take and subscribe an oath and thenceforward keep and maintain said oath inviolate
and which oath shall be registered for permanent preservation and shall be of the tenor and effect following
to wit
do solemnly swear
in presence of almighty god
that i will henceforth faithfully support
and defend the constitution of the united states and the union of the states thereunder and that i will in like manner abide by and faithfully support all acts of congress passed during the existing rebellion with reference to slaves
so long and so far as not repealed
or held void by congress or by decision of the supreme court and that i will in like manner abide by and faithfully support all proclamations of the president made during the existing rebellion having reference to slaves
so long and so far as not modified or declared void by decision of the supreme court
so help me god
the persons excepted from the benefits of the foregoing provisions are all who are or shall have been civil or diplomatic officers or agents of the so called confederate government all who have left judicial stations under the united states to aid the rebellion all who are or shall have been military or naval officers of said so called confederate government above the rank of colonel in the army or of lieutenant in the navy all who left seats in the united states congress to aid the rebellion all who resigned commissions in the army or navy of the united states and afterwards aided the rebellion and all who have engaged in any way in treating colored persons
or white persons in charge of such
otherwise than lawfully as prisoners of war
and which persons may have been found in the united states service as soldiers
or in any other capacity
and i do further proclaim
and make known that whenever
in any of the states of arkansas
south carolina
and north carolina
a number of persons
not less than one tenth in number of the votes cast in such state at the presidential election of the year a
each having taken oath aforesaid
and not having since violated it
and being a qualified voter by the election law of the state existing immediately before the so called act of secession
and excluding all others
shall reestablish a state government which shall be republican and in nowise contravening said oath
such shall be recognized as the true government of the state
and the state shall receive thereunder the benefits of the constitutional provision which declares that the united states shall guarantee to every state in this union a republican form of government and shall protect each of them against invasion
on application of the legislature
or the executive when the legislature can not be convened
against domestic violence
and i do further proclaim
and make known that any provision which may be adopted by such state government in relation to the freed people of such state which shall recognize and declare their permanent freedom
provide for their education
and which may yet be consistent as a temporary arrangement with their present condition as a laboring
and homeless class
will not be objected to by the national executive
and it is suggested as not improper that in constructing a loyal state government in any state the name of the state
the boundary
the subdivisions
the constitution
and the general code of laws as before the rebellion be maintained
subject only to the modifications made necessary by the conditions hereinbefore stated
and such others
if any
not contravening said co and which may be deemed expedient by those framing the new state government
to avoid misunderstanding
it may be proper to say that this proclamation
so far as it relates to state governments
has no reference to states wherein loyal state governments have all the while been maintained
and for the same reason it may be proper to further say that whether members sent to congress from any state shall be admitted to seats constitutionally rests exclusively with the respective houses
and not to any extent with the executive
still further
that this proclamation is intended to present the people of the states wherein the national authority has been suspended and loyal state governments have been subverted a mode in and by which the national authority and loyal state governments may be re established within said states or in any of them and while the mode presented is the best the executive can suggest
with his present impressions
it must not be understood that no other possible mode would be acceptable

annual message to congress
december 8
fellow citizens of the senate and house of representatives
another year of health
and of sufficiently abundant harvests
has passed
for these
and especially for the improved condition cf our national affairs
our renewed and profoundest gratitude to god is due
we remain in peace and friendship with foreign powers
the efforts of disloyal citizens of the united states to involve us in foreign wars
to aid an inexcusable insurrection
have been unavailing
her britannic majesty's government
as was justly expected
have exercised their authority to prevent the departure of new hostile expeditions from british ports
the emperor of france has
by a like proceeding
promptly vindicated the neutrality which he proclaimed at the beginning of the contest
questions of great intricacy and importance have arisen out of the blockade
and other belligerent operations
between the government and several of the maritime powers
but they have been discussed
as far as was possible
in a spirit of frankness
and mutual good will
it is especially gratifying that our prize courts
by the impartiality of their adjudications
have commanded the respect and confidence of maritime powers
the supplemental treaty between the united states and great britain for the suppression of the african slave trade
made on the 17th day of february last
has been duly ratified and carried into execution
it is believed that
so far as american ports and american citizens are concerned
that inhuman and odious traffic has been brought to an end
i shall submit
for the consideration of the senate
a convention for the adjustment of possessory claims in washington territory
arising out of the treaty of the 15th of june
between the united states and great britain
and which have been the source of some disquiet among the citizens of that now rapidly improving part of the country
a novel and important question
involving the extent of the maritime jurisdiction of spain in the waters which surround the island of cuba
has been debated without reaching an agreement
and it is proposed
in an amicable spirit
to refer it to the arbitrament of a friendly power
a convention for that purpose will be submitted to the senate
i have thought it proper
subject to the approval of the senate
to concur with the interested commercial powers in an arrangement for the liquidation of the scheldt dues upon the principles which have been heretofore adopted in regard to the imposts upon navigation in the waters of denmark
the long pending controversy between this government and that of chile touching the seizure at sitana
in peru
by chilean officers
of a large amount in treasure belonging to citizens of the united states has been brought to a close by the award of his majesty the king of the belgians
to whose arbitration the question was referred by the parties
the subject was thoroughly and patiently examined by that justly respected magistrate
and although the sum awarded to the claimants may not have been as large as they expected there is no reason to distrust the wisdom of his majesty's decision
that decision was promptly complied with by chile when intelligence in regard to it reached that country
the joint commission under the act of the last session of carrying into effect the convention with peru on the subject of claims has been organized at lima
and is engaged in the business intrusted to it
difficulties concerning interoceanic transit through nicaragua are in course of amicable adjustment
in conformity with principles set forth in my last annual message
i have received a representative from the united states of colombia
and have accredited a minister to that republic
incidents occurring in the progress of our civil war have forced upon my attention the uncertain state of international questions touching the rights of foreigners in this country and of united states citizens abroad
in regard to some governments these rights are at least partially defined by treaties
in no instance
is it expressly stipulated that in the event of civil war a foreigner residing in this country within the lines of the insurgents is to be exempted from the rule which classes him as a belligerent
in whose behalf the government of his country can not expect any privileges or immunities distinct from that character
i regret to say
that such claims have been put forward
and in some instances in behalf of foreigners who have lived in the united states the greater part of their lives
there is reason to believe that many persons born in foreign countries who have declared their intention to become citizens
or who have been fully naturalized have evaded the military duty required of them by denying the fact and thereby throwing upon the government the burden of proof
it has been found difficult or impracticable to obtain this proof from the want of guides to the proper sources of information
these might be supplied by requiring clerks of courts where declarations of intention may be made or naturalizations effected to send periodically lists of the names of the persons naturalized or declaring their intention to become citizens to the secretary of the interior
in whose department those names might be arranged and printed for general information
there is also reason to believe that foreigners frequently become citizens of the united states for the sole purpose of evading duties imposed by the laws of their native countries
to which on becoming naturalized here they at once repair
and though never returning to the united states they still claim the interposition of this government as citizens
many altercations and great prejudices have heretofore arisen out of this abuse
it is therefore submitted to your serious consideration
it might be advisable to fix a limit beyond which no citizen of the united states residing abroad may claim the interposition of his government
the right of suffrage has often been assumed and exercised by aliens under pretenses of naturalization
which they have disavowed when drafted into the military service
i submit the expediency of such an amendment of the law as will make the fact of voting an estoppe against any plea of exemption from military service or other civil obligation on the ground of alienage
in common with other western powers
our relations with japan have been brought into serious jeopardy through the perverse opposition of the hereditary aristocracy of the empire to the enlightened and liberal policy of the tycoon
designed to bring the country into the society of nations
it is hoped
although not with entire confidence
that these difficulties may be peacefully overcome
i ask your attention to the claim of the minister residing there for the damages he sustained in the destruction by fire of the residence of the legation at yedo
satisfactory arrangements have been made with the emperor of russia
it is believed
will result in effecting a continuous line of telegraph through that empire from our pacific coast
i recommend to your favorable consideration the subject of an international telegraph across the atlantic ocean
and also of a telegraph between this capital and the national forts along the atlantic seaboard and the gulf of mexico
such communications
established with any reasonable outlay
would be economical as well as effective aids to the diplomatic
and naval service
the consular system of the united states
under the enactments of the last congress
begins to be self sustaining
and there is reason to hope that it may become entirely so with the increase of trade which will ensue whenever peace is restored
our ministers abroad have been faithful in defending american rights
in protecting commercial interests our consuls have necessarily had to encounter increased labors and responsibilities growing out of the war
these they have for the most part met and discharged with zeal and efficiency
this acknowledgment justly includes those consuls who
residing in morocco
and other oriental countries
are charged with complex functions and extraordinary powers
the condition of the several organized territories is generally satisfactory
although indian disturbances in new mexico have not been entirely suppressed
the mineral resources of colorado
new mexico
and arizona are proving far richer than has been heretofore understood
i lay before you a communication on this subject from the governor of new mexico
i again submit to your consideration the expediency of establishing a system for the encouragement of immigration
although this source of national wealth and strength is again flowing with greater freedom than for several years before the insurrection occurred
there is still a great deficiency of laborers in every field of industry
especially in agriculture and in our mines
as well of iron and coal as of the precious metals
while the demand for labor is much increased here
tens of thousands of persons
destitute of remunerative occupation
are thronging our foreign consulates and offering to emigrate to the united states if essential
but very cheap
assistance can be afforded them
it is easy to see that under the sharp discipline of civil war the nation is beginning a new life
this noble effort demands the aid and ought to receive the attention and support of the government
injuries unforeseen by the government and unintended may in some cases have been inflicted on the subjects or citizens of foreign countries
both at sea and on land
by persons in the service of the united states
as this government expects redress from other powers when similar injuries are inflicted by persons in their service upon citizens of the united states
we must be prepared to do justice to foreigners
if the existing judicial tribunals are inadequate to this purpose
a special court may be authorized
with power to hear and decide such claims of the character referred to as may have arisen under treaties and the public law
conventions for adjusting the claims by joint commission have been proposed to some governments
but no definitive answer to the proposition has yet been received from any
in the course of the session i shall probably have occasion to request you to provide indemnification to claimants where decrees of restitution have been rendered and damages awarded by admiralty courts
and in other cases where this government may be acknowledged to be liable in principle and where the amount of that liability has been ascertained by an informal arbitration
the proper officers of the treasury have deemed themselves required by the law of the united states upon the subject to demand a tax upon the incomes of foreign consuls in this country
while such a demand may not in strictness be in derogation of public law
or perhaps of any existing treaty between the united states and a foreign country
the expediency of so far modifying the act as to exempt from tax the income of such consuls as are not citizens of the united states
derived from the emoluments of their office or from property not situated in the united states
is submitted to your serious consideration
i make this suggestion upon the ground that a comity which ought to be reciprocated exempts our consuls in all other countries from taxation to the extent thus indicated
the united states
i think
ought not to be exceptionally illiberal to international trade and commerce
the operations of the treasury during the last year have been successfully conducted
the enactment by congress of a national banking law has proved a valuable support of the public credit
and the general legislation in relation to loans has fully answered the expectations of its favorers
some amendments may be required to perfect existing laws
but no change in their principles or general scope is believed to be needed
since these measures have been in operation all demands on the treasury
including the pay of the army and navy
have been promptly met and fully satisfied
no considerable body of troops
it is believed
were ever more amply provided and more liberally and punctually paid
and it may be added that by no people were the burdens incident to a great war ever more cheerfully borne
the receipts during the year from all sources
including loans and balance in the treasury at its commencement
were 901
and the aggregate disbursements 895
leaving a balance on the 1st of july
of 5
of the receipts there were derived from customs 69
from internal revenue 37
from direct tax 1
from lands 167
from miscellaneous sources 3
and from loans 776
making the aggregate 901
of the disbursements there were for the civil service 23
for pensions and indians 4
for interest on public debt 24
for the war department 599
for the navy department 63
for payment of funded and temporary debt 181
making the aggregate 895
65 and leaving the balance of 5
but the payment of funded and temporary debt
having been made from moneys borrowed during the year
must be regarded as merely nominal payments and the moneys borrowed to make them as merely nominal receipts
and their amount
should therefore be deducted both from receipts and disbursements
this being done there remains as actual receipts 720
79 and the actual disbursements 714
leaving the balance as already stated
the actual receipts and disbursements for the first quarter and the estimated receipts and disbursements for the remaining three quarters of the current fiscal year 1864 will be shown in detail by the report of the secretary of the treasury
to which i invite your attention
it is sufficient to say here that it is not believed that actual results will exhibit a state of the finances less favorable to the country than the estimates of that officer heretofore submitted while it is confidently expected that at the close of the year both disbursements and debt will be found very considerably less than has been anticipated
the report of the secretary of war is a document of great interest
it consists of
the military operations of the year
detailed in the report of the general in chief
the organization of colored persons into the war service
the exchange of prisoners
fully set forth in the letter of general hitchcock
the operations under the act for enrolling and calling out the national forces
detailed in the report of the provost marshal general
the organization of the invalid corps
and 6
the operation of the several departments of the quartermaster general
chief of engineers
chief of ordnance
and surgeon general
it has appeared impossible to make a valuable summary of this report
except such as would be too extended for this place
and hence i content myself by asking your careful attention to the report itself
the duties devolving on the naval branch of the service during the year and throughout the whole of this unhappy contest have been discharged with fidelity and eminent success
the extensive blockade has been constantly increasing in efficiency as the navy has expanded
yet on so long a line it has so far been impossible to entirely suppress illicit trade
from returns received at the navy department it appears that more than 1
000 vessels have been captured since the blockade was instituted
and that the value of prizes already sent in for adjudication amounts to over 13
the naval force of the united states consists at this time of five hundred and eighty eight vessels completed and in the course of completion
and of these seventy five are ironclad or armored steamers
the events of the war give an increased interest and importance to the navy which will probably extend beyond the war itself
the armored vessels in our navy completed and in service
or which are under contract and approaching completion
are believed to exceed in number those of any other power but while these may be relied upon for harbor defense and coast service
others of greater strength and capacity will be necessary for cruising purposes and to maintain our rightful position on the ocean
the change that has taken place in naval vessels and naval warfare since the introduction of steam as a motive power for ships of war demands either a corresponding change in some of our existing navy yards or the establishment of new ones for the construction and necessary repair of modern naval vessels
no inconsiderable embarrassment
and public injury have been experienced from the want of such governmental establishments
the necessity of such a navy yard
so furnished
at some suitable place upon the atlantic seaboard has on repeated occasions been brought to the attention of congress by the navy department
and is again presented in the report of the secretary which accompanies this communication
i think it my duty to invite your special attention to this subject
and also to that of establishing a yard and depot for naval purposes upon one of the western rivers
a naval force has been created on those interior waters
and under many disadvantages
within little more than two years
exceeding in numbers the whole naval force of the country at the commencement of the present administration
satisfactory and important as have been the performances of the heroic men of the navy at this interesting period
they are scarcely more wonderful than the success of our mechanics and artisans in the production of war vessels
which has created a new form of naval power
our country has advantages superior to any other nation in our resources of iron and timber
with inexhaustible quantities of fuel in the immediate vicinity of both
and all available and in close proximity to navigable waters
without the advantage of public works
the resources of the nation have been developed and its power displayed in the construction of a navy of such magnitude
which has at the very period of its creation rendered signal service to the union
the increase of the number of seamen in the public service from 7
500 men in the spring of 1861 to about 34
000 at the present time has been accomplished without special legislation or extraordinary bounties to promote that increase
it has been found
that the operation of the draft
with the high bounties paid for army recruits
is beginning to affect injuriously the naval service
and will
if not corrected
be likely to impair its efficiency by detaching seamen from their proper vocation and inducing them to enter the army
i therefore respectfully suggest that congress might aid both the army and naval services by a definite provision on this subject which would at the same time be equitable to the communities more especially interested
i commend to your consideration the suggestions of the secretary of the navy in regard to the policy of fostering and training seamen and also the education of officers and engineers for the naval service
the naval academy is rendering signal service in preparing midshipmen for the highly responsible duties which in after life they will be required to perform
in order that the country should not be deprived of the proper quota of educated officers
for which legal provision has been made at the naval school
the vacancies caused by the neglect or omission to make nominations from the states in insurrection have been filled by the secretary of the navy
the school is now more full and complete than at any former period
and in every respect entitled to the favorable consideration of congress
during the past fiscal year the financial condition of the post office department has been one of increasing prosperity
and i am gratified in being able to state that the actual postal revenue has nearly equaled the entire expenditures
the latter amounting to 11
84 and the former to 11
leaving a deficiency of but 150
in 1860
the year immediately preceding the rebellion
the deficiency amounted to 5
the postal receipts of that year being 2
19 less that those of 1863
the decrease since 1860 in the annual amount of transportation has been only about twenty five per cent
but the annual expenditure on account of the same has been reduced thirty five per cent
it is manifest
that the post office department may become self sustaining in a few years
even with the restoration of the whole service
the international conference of postal delegates from the principal countries of europe and america
which was called at the suggestion of the postmaster general
met at paris on the 11th of may last and concluded its deliberations on the 8th of june
the principles established by the conference as best adapted to facilitate postal intercourse between nations and as the basis of future postal conventions inaugurate a general system of uniform international charges at reduced rates of postage
and can not fail to produce beneficial results
i refer you to the report of the secretary of the interior
which is herewith laid before you
for useful and varied information in relation to the public lands
indian affairs
and other matters of public concern pertaining to his department
the quantity of land disposed of during the last and the first quarter of the present fiscal years was 3
549 acres
of which 161
911 acres were sold for cash
514 acres were taken up under the homestead law
and the residue disposed of under laws granting lands for military bounties
for railroad and other purposes
it also appears that the sale of the public lands is largely on the increase
it has long been a cherished opinion of some of our wisest statesmen that the people of the united states had a higher and more enduring interest in the early settlement and substantial cultivation of the public lands than in the amount of direct revenue to be derived from the sale of them
this opinion has had a controlling influence in shaping legislation upon the subject of our national domain
i may cite as evidence of this the liberal measures adopted in reference to actual settlers the grant to the states of the overflowed lands within their limits
in order to their being reclaimed and rendered fit for cultivation the grants to railway companies of alternate sections of land upon the contemplated lines of their roads
which when completed will so largely multiply the facilities for reaching our distant possessions
this policy has received its most signal and beneficent illustration in the recent enactment granting homesteads to actual settlers
since the 1st day of january last the before mentioned quantity of 1
514 acres of land have been taken up under its provisions
this fact and the amount of sales furnish gratifying evidence of increasing settlement upon the public lands
notwithstanding the great struggle in which the energies of the nation have been engaged
and which has required so large a withdrawal of our citizens from their accustomed pursuits
i cordially concur in the recommendation of the secretary of the interior suggesting a modification of the act in favor of those engaged in the military and naval service of the united states
i doubt not that congress will cheerfully adopt such measures as will
without essentially changing the general features of the system
secure to the greatest practicable extent its benefits to those who have left their homes in the defense of the country in this arduous crisis
i invite your attention to the views of the secretary as to the propriety of raising by appropriate legislation a revenue from the mineral lands of the united states
the measures provided at your last session for the removal of certain indian tribes have been carried into effect
sundry treaties have been negotiated
which will in due time be submitted for the constitutional action of the senate
they contain stipulations for extinguishing the possessory rights of the indians to large and valuable tracts of lands
it is hoped that the effect of these treaties will result in the establishment of permanent friendly relations with such of these tribes as have been brought into frequent and bloody collision with our outlying settlements and emigrants
sound policy and our imperative duty to these wards of the government demand our anxious and constant attention to their material well being
to their progress in the arts of civilization
above all
to that moral training which under the blessing of divine providence will confer upon them the elevated and sanctifying influences
the hopes and consolations
of the christian faith
i suggested in my last annual message the propriety of remodeling our indian system
subsequent events have satisfied me of its necessity
the details set forth in the report of the secretary evince the urgent need for immediate legislative action
i commend the benevolent institutions established or patronized by the government in this district to your generous and fostering care
the attention of congress during the last session was engaged to some extent with a proposition for enlarging the water communication between the mississippi river and the northeastern seaboard
which proposition
failed for the time
since then
upon a call of the greatest respectability
a convention has been held at chicago upon the same subject
a summary of whose views is contained in a memorial addressed to the president and congress
and which i now have the honor to lay before you
that this interest is one which ere long will force its own way i do not entertain a doubt
while it is submitted entirely to your wisdom as to what can be done now
augmented interest is given to this subject by the actual commencement of work upon the pacific railroad
under auspices so favorable to rapid progress and completion
the enlarged navigation becomes a palpable need to the great road
i transmit the second annual report of the commissioner of the department of agriculture
asking your attention to the developments in that vital interest of the nation
when congress assembled a year ago
the war had already lasted nearly twenty months
and there had been many conflicts on both land and sea
with varying results the rebellion had been pressed back into reduced limits yet the tone of public feeling and opinion
at home and abroad
was not satisfactory
with other signs
the popular elections then just past indicated uneasiness among ourselves
amid much that was cold and menacing
the kindest words coming from europe were uttered in accents of pity that we are too blind to surrender a hopeless cause
our commerce was suffering greatly by a few armed vessels built upon and furnished from foreign shores
and we were threatened with such additions from the same quarter as would sweep our trade from the sea and raise our blockade
we had failed to elicit from european governments anything hopeful upon this subject
the preliminary emancipation proclamation
issued in september
was running its assigned period to the beginning of the new year
a month later the final proclamation came
including the announcement that colored men of suitable condition would be received into the war service
the policy of emancipation and of employing black soldiers gave to the future a new aspect
about which hope and fear and doubt contended in uncertain conflict
according to our political system
as a matter of civil administration
the general government had no lawful power to effect emancipation in any state
and for a long time it had been hoped that the rebellion could be suppressed without resorting to it as a military measure
it was all the while deemed possible that the necessity for it might come
and that if it should the crisis of the contest would then be presented
it came
as was anticipated
it was followed by dark and doubtful days
eleven months having now passed
we are permitted to take another review
the rebel borders are pressed still farther back
and by the complete opening of the mississippi the country dominated by the rebellion is divided into distinct parts
with no practical communication between them
tennessee and arkansas have been substantially cleared of insurgent control
and influential citizens in each
owners of slaves and advocates of slavery at the beginning of the rebellion
now declare openly for emancipation in their respective states
of those states not included in the emancipation proclamation
maryland and missouri
neither of which three years ago would tolerate any restraint upon the extension of slavery into new territories
dispute now only as to the best mode of removing it within their own limits
of those who were slaves at the beginning of the rebellion full 100
000 are now in the united states military service
about one half of which number actually bear arms in the ranks
thus giving the double advantage of taking so much labor from the insurgent cause and supplying the places which otherwise must be filled with so many white men
so far as tested
it is difficult to say they are not as good soldiers as any
no servile insurrection or tendency to violence or cruelty has marked the measures of emancipation and arming the blacks
these measures have been much discussed in foreign countries
contemporary with such discussion
the tone of public sentiment there is much improved
at home the same measures have been fully discussed
and denounced
and the annual elections following are highly encouraging to those whose official duty it is to bear the country through this great trial
thus we have the new reckoning
the crisis which threatened to divide the friends of the union is past
looking now to the present and future
and with reference to a resumption of the national authority within the states wherein that authority has been suspended
i have thought fit to issue a proclamation
a copy of which is herewith transmitted
on examination of this proclamation it will appear
as is believed
that nothing will be attempted beyond what is amply justified by the constitution
the form of an oath is given
but no man is coerced to take it
the man is promised a pardon only in case he voluntarily takes the oath
the constitution authorizes the executive to grant or withhold the pardon at his own absolute discretion
and this includes the power to grant on terms
as is fully established by judicial and other authorities
it is also proffered that if in any of the states named a state government shall be in the mode prescribed set up
such government shall be recognized and guaranteed by the united states
and that under it the state shall
on the constitutional conditions
be protected against invasion and domestic violence
the constitutional obligation of the united states to guarantee to every state in the union a republican form of government and to protect the state in the cases stated is explicit and full
but why tender the benefits of this provision only to a state government set up in this particular way
this section of the constitution contemplates a case wherein the element within a state favorable to republican government in the union may be too feeble for an opposite and hostile element external to or even within the state
and such are precisely the cases with which we are now dealing
an attempt to guarantee and protect a revived state government
constructed in whole or in preponderating part from the very element against whose hostility and violence it is to be protected
is simply absurd
there must be a test by which to separate the opposing elements
so as to build only from the sound and that test is a sufficiently liberal one which accepts as sound whoever will make a sworn recantation of his former unsoundness
but if it be proper to require as a test of admission to the political body an oath of allegiance to the constitution of the united states and to the union under it
why also to the laws and proclamations in regard to slavery
those laws and proclamations were enacted and put forth for the purpose of aiding in the suppression of the rebellion
to give them their fullest effect there had to be a pledge for their maintenance
in my judgment
they have aided and will further aid the cause for which they were intended
to now abandon them would be not only to relinquish a lever of power
but would also be a cruel and an astounding breach of faith
i may add at this point that while i remain in my present position i shall not attempt to retract or modify the emancipation proclamation
nor shall i return to slavery any person who is free by the terms of that proclamation or by any of the acts of congress
for these and other reasons it is thought best that support of these measures shall be included in the oath
and it is believed the executive may lawfully claim it in return for pardon and restoration of forfeited rights
which he has clear constitutional power to withhold altogether or grant upon the terms which he shall deem wisest for the public interest
it should be observed also that this part of the oath is subject to the modifying and abrogating power of legislation and supreme judicial decision
the proposed acquiescence of the national executive in any reasonable temporary state arrangement for the freed people is made with the view of possibly modifying the confusion and destitution which must at best attend all classes by a total revolution of labor throughout whole states
it is hoped that the already deeply afflicted people in those states may be somewhat more ready to give up the cause of their affliction if to this extent this vital matter be left to themselves
while no power of the national executive to prevent an abuse is abridged by the proposition
the suggestion in the proclamation as to maintaining the political framework of the states on what is called reconstruction is made in the hope that it may do good without danger of harm
it will save labor and avoid great confusion
but why any proclamation now upon this subject
this question is beset with the conflicting views that the step might be delayed too long or be taken too soon
in some states the elements for resumption seem ready for action
but remain inactive apparently for want of a rallying point a plan of action
why shall a adopt the plan of b rather than b that of a
and if a and b should agree
how can they know but that the general government here will reject their plan
by the proclamation a plan is presented which may be accepted by them as a rallying point
and which they are assured in advance will not be rejected here
this may bring them to act sooner than they otherwise would
the objections to a premature presentation of a plan by the national executive consist in the danger of committals on points which could be more safely left to further developments
care has been taken to so shape the document as to avoid embarrassments from this source
saying that on certain terms certain classes will be pardoned with rights restored
it is not said that other classes or other terms will never be included
saying that reconstruction will be accepted if presented in a specified way
it is not said it will never be accepted in any other way
the movements by state action for emancipation in several of the states not included in the emancipation proclamation are matters of profound gratulation
and while i do not repeat in detail what i have heretofore so earnestly urged upon this subject my general views and feelings remain unchanged and i trust that congress will omit no fair opportunity of aiding these important steps to a great consummation
in the midst of other cares
however important we must not lose sight of the fact that the war power is still our main reliance
to that power alone we look yet for a time to give confidence to the people in the contested regions that the insurgent power will not again overrun them
until that confidence shall be established little can be done anywhere what is called reconstruction
hence our chiefest care must still be directed to the army and navy who have thus far borne their harder part so nobly and well and it may be esteemed fortunate that giving the greatest efficiency to these indispensable arms we do also honorably recognize the gallant men
from commander to sentinel
who compose them
and to whom more than to others the world must stand indebted for the home of freedom disenthralled
and perpetuated

proclamation concerning discriminating duties
december 16
by the president of the united states of america
a proclamation
whereas by an act of the congress of the united states of the 24th of may
entitled an act in addition to an act entitled 'an act concerning discriminating duties of tonnage and impost' and to equalize the duties on prussian vessels and their cargoes
it is provided that upon satisfactory evidence being given to the president of the united states by the government of any foreign nation that no discriminating duties of tonnage or impost are imposed or levied in the ports of the said nation upon vessels wholly belonging to citizens of the united states or upon the produce
or merchandise imported in the same from the united states or from any foreign country
the president is thereby authorized to issue his proclamation declaring that the foreign discriminating duties of tonnage and impost within the united states are and shall be suspended and discontinued so far as respects the vessels of the said foreign nation and the produce
or merchandise imported into the united states in the same from the said foreign nation or from any other foreign country
the said suspension to take effect from the time of such notification being given to the president of the united states and to continue so long as the reciprocal exemption of vessels belonging to citizens of the united states and their cargoes
as aforesaid
shall be continued
and no longer and whereas satisfactory evidence has lately been received by me through an official communication of senor don luis molina
envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary of the republic of nicaragua
under date of the 28th of november
that no other or higher duties of tonnage and impost have been imposed or levied since the second day of august
in the ports of nicaragua

sending a note to the secretary of the navy

he only wishes and in which i concur that general gillmore will courteously confer with
and explain to
admiral dahlgren
in regard to the western matter
i believe the program will have to stand substantially as i first put it
and especially brown
believe that the social influence of st
louis would inevitably tell injuriously upon general pope in the particular difficulty existing there
and i think there is some force in that view

and three accompanying letters
one by yourself
one by a mr

and one by a mr
john d
the whole relating to the rev
the petition prays
in the name of justice and mercy
that i will restore dr
mcpheeters to all his ecclesiastical rights
this gives no intimation as to what ecclesiastical rights are withheld
your letter states that provost marshal dick
about a year ago
ordered the arrest of dr
pastor of the vine street church
prohibited him from officiating
and placed the management of the affairs of the church out of the control of its chosen trustees and near the close you state that a certain course would insure his release
mr
ranney's letter says
samuel s
mcpheeters is enjoying all the rights of a civilian
but cannot preach the gospel
mr
in his letter
is it not a strange illustration of the condition of things
that the question of who shall be allowed to preach in a church in st
louis shall be decided by the president of the united states
now
all this sounds very strangely and
a little as if you gentlemen making the application do not understand the case alike one affirming that the doctor is enjoying all the rights of a civilian
and another pointing out to me what will secure his release
on the second day of january last
i wrote to general curtis in relation to mr
dick's order upon dr
mcpheeters and
as i suppose the doctor is enjoying all the rights of a civilian
i only quote that part of my letter which relates to the church
it is as follows
but i must add that the united states government must not
as by this order
undertake to run the churches
when an individual
in a church or out of it
becomes dangerous to the public interest
he must be checked but the churches
as such
must take care of themselves
it will not do for the united states to appoint trustees
or other agents for the churches
this letter going to general curtis
then in command there
i supposed
of course
it was obeyed
especially as i heard no further complaint from dr
mcpheeters or his friends for nearly an entire year
i have never interfered
nor thought of interfering
as to who shall or shall not preach in any church nor have i knowingly or believingly tolerated any one else to so interfere by my authority
if any one is so interfering by color of my authority
i would like to have it specifically made known to me
after all
what is now sought is to have me put dr
mcpheeters back over the heads of a majority of his own congregation
will be declined
i will not have control of any church on any side

by a joint resolution of your honorable bodies approved december 23
the paying of bounties to veteran volunteers
as now practiced by the war department
to the extent of three hundred dollars in each case
prohibited after this 5th day of the present month
i transmit for your consideration a communication from the secretary of war
accompanied by one from the provost marshal general to him
both relating to the subject above mentioned
i earnestly recommend that the law be so modified as to allow bounties to be paid as they now are
at least until the ensuing 1st day of february
i am not without anxiety lest i appear to be importunate in thus recalling your attention to a subject upon which you have so recently acted
and nothing but a deep conviction that the public interest demands it could induce me to incur the hazard of being misunderstood on this point
the executive approval was given by me to the resolution mentioned
and it is now by a closer attention and a fuller knowledge of facts that i feel constrained to recommend a reconsideration of the subject

yours of yesterday received
nothing is known here about general foster's order
of which you complain
beyond the fair presumption that it comes from general grant
and that it has an object which
if you understood
you would be loath to frustrate
these troops are
in strict law
only to be removed by my order but general grant's judgment would be the highest incentive to me to make such order
nor can i understand how doing so is bad faith and dishonor
nor yet how it so exposes kentucky to ruin
military men here do not perceive how it exposes kentucky
and i am sure grant would not permit it if it so appeared to him

i understand an effort is being made by some worthy gentlemen to reconstruct a legal state government in florida
florida is in your department
and it is not unlikely you may be there in person
i have given mr
hay a commission of major
and sent him to you
with some blank books and other blanks
to aid in the reconstruction
he will explain as to the manner of using the blanks
and also my general views on the subject
it is desirable for all to co operate
but if irreconcilable differences of opinion shall arise
you are master
i wish the thing done in the most speedy way
so that when done it be within the range of the late proclamation on the subject
the detail labor will
of course
have to be done by others but i will be greatly obliged if you will give it such general supervision as you can find consistent with your more strictly military duties

the number for this month and year of the north american review was duly received
and for which please accept my thanks
of course i am not the most impartial judge yet
with due allowance for this
i venture to hope that the article entitled the president's policy will be of value to the country
i fear i am not worthy of all which is therein kindly said of me personally
the sentence of twelve lines
commencing at the top of page 252
i could wish to be not exactly what it is
in what is there expressed
the writer has not correctly understood me
i have never had a theory that secession could absolve states or people from their obligations
precisely the contrary is asserted in the inaugural address and it was because of my belief in the continuation of those obligations that i was puzzled
for a time
as to denying the legal rights of those citizens who remained individually innocent of treason or rebellion
but i mean no more now than to merely call attention to this point

or all such as voters may attend for that purpose
that the voters attending at eight o'clock in the morning of said day may choose judges and clerks of election for such purpose that all persons qualified by said constitution and laws
and taking the oath presented in the president's proclamation of december 8
either before or at the election
and none others
may be voters that each set of judges and clerks may make returns directly to you on or before the th day of next that in all other respects said election may be conducted according to said constitution and laws
that on receipt of said returns
when five thousand four hundred and six votes shall have been cast
you can receive said votes

who shall appear before you at little rock

to the artist f
february 6
it had got to be
said mr
things had gone on from bad to worse
until i felt that we had reached the end of our rope on the plan of operations we had been pursuing that we had about played our last card
and must change our tactics
or lose the game
i now determined upon the adoption of the emancipation policy and without consultation with
or the knowledge of
the cabinet
i prepared the original draft of the proclamation
after much anxious thought
called a cabinet meeting upon the subject
this was the last of july or the first part of the month of august
the exact date was july 22
all were present excepting mr
the postmaster general
who was absent at the opening of the discussion
but came in subsequently
i said to the cabinet that i had resolved upon this step
and had not called them together to ask their advice
but to lay the subject matter of a proclamation before them
suggestions as to which would be in order after they had heard it read
lovejoy was in error when he informed you that it excited no comment excepting on the part of secretary seward
various suggestions were offered
secretary chase wished the language stronger in reference to the arming of the blacks
after he came in
deprecated the policy on the ground that it would cost the administration the fall elections
was offered that i had not already fully anticipated and settled in my mind
until secretary seward spoke
he said in substance
i approve of the proclamation
but i question the expediency of its issue at this juncture
the depression of the public mind
consequent upon our repeated reverses
is so great that i fear the effect of so important a step
it may be viewed as the last measure of an exhausted government
a cry for help the government stretching forth its hands to ethiopia
instead of ethiopia stretching forth her hands to the government
 his idea
said the president
was that it would be considered our last shriek on the retreat
this was his precise expression
now
 continued mr
while i approve the measure
i suggest
that you postpone its issue until you can give it to the country supported by military success
instead of issuing it
as would be the case now
upon the greatest disasters of the war
 mr
lincoln continued the wisdom of the view of the secretary of state struck me with very great force
it was an aspect of the case that
in all my thought upon the subject
i had entirely overlooked
the result was that i put the draft of the proclamation aside
as you do your sketch for a picture
waiting for a victory
from time to time i added or changed a line
touching it up here and there
anxiously watching the process of events
the next news we had was of pope's disaster at bull run
things looked darker than ever
finally came the week of the battle of antietam
i determined to wait no longer
the news came
i think
on wednesday
that the advantage was on our side
i was then staying at the soldiers' home three miles out of washington
here i finished writing the second draft of the preliminary proclamation came up on saturday called the cabinet together to hear it
and it was published on the following monday

saying that he

some single mind must be master
else there will be no agreement in anything

the ports of the states of south carolina
and texas were
for reasons therein set forth
placed under blockade and whereas
the port of brownsville
in the district of brazos santiago
in the state of texas
has since been blockaded
but as the blockade of said port may now be safely relaxed with advantage to the interests of commerce
be it known that i
abraham lincoln
president of the united states
pursuant to the authority in me vested by the fifth section of the act of congress approved on the 13th of july
entitled an act further to provide for the collection of duties on imports
and for other purposes
do hereby declare that the blockade of the said port of brownsville shall so far cease and determine from and after this date
that commercial intercourse with said port
except as to persons
and information hereinafter specified
from this date

subject to the laws of the united states

this proclamation does not authorize or allow the shipment or conveyance of persons in

if required
to any officer in charge of the blockade
and on leaving said port every vessel will be required to have a clearance from the collector of the customs
according to law
showing no violation of the conditions of the license
any violations of said conditions will involve the forfeiture and condemnation of the vessel and cargo
and the exclusion of all parties concerned from any further privilege of entering the united states during the war for any purpose whatever

the existing blockade remains in full force and effect as hitherto established and maintained

secretary of state
tennessee your telegram of the twenty sixth instant asking for a copy of my despatch to warren jordan
at nashville press office
has just been referred to me by governor johnson
in my reply to mr
which was brief and hurried
i intended to say that in the county and state elections of tennessee
the oath prescribed in the proclamation of governor johnson on the twenty sixth of january
ordering an election in tennessee on the first saturday in march next
is entirely satisfactory to me as a test of loyalty of all persons proposing or offering to vote in said elections and coming from him would better be observed and followed
there is no conflict between the oath of amnesty in my proclamation of eighth december
and that prescribed by governor johnson in his proclamation of the twenty sixth ultimo
no person who has taken the oath of amnesty of eighth december
and obtained a pardon thereby
and who intends to observe the same in good faith
should have any objection to taking that prescribed by governor johnson as a test of loyalty
i have seen and examined governor johnson's proclamation
and am entirely satisfied with his plan
which is to restore the state government and place it under the control of citizens truly loyal to the government of the united states
please send above to governor johnson

secretary of war
you ask some instructions from me in relation to the report of special commission constituted by an order of the war department
dated december 5
to revise the enrolment and quotas of the city and state of new york
and report whether there be any
and what
errors or irregularities therein
and what corrections
if any
should be made
in the correspondence between the governor of new york and myself last summer
i understood him to complain that the enrolments in several of the districts of that state had been neither accurately nor honestly made and in view of this
for the draft then immediately ensuing
ordered an arbitrary reduction of the quotas in several of the districts wherein they seemed too large
and said
after this drawing
these four districts
and also the seventeenth and twenty ninth
shall be carefully re enrolled
if you please
agents of yours may witness every step of the process
in a subsequent letter i believe some additional districts were put into the list of those to be re enrolled
my idea was to do the work over according to the law
in presence of the complaining party
and thereby to correct anything which might be found amiss
the commission
whose work i am considering
seem to have proceeded upon a totally different idea
not going forth to find men at all
they have proceeded altogether upon paper examinations and mental processes
one of their conclusions
as i understand
is that
as the law stands
and attempting to follow it
the enrolling officers could not have made the enrolments much more accurately than they did
the report on this point might be useful to congress
the commission conclude that the quotas for the draft should be based upon entire population
and they proceed upon this basis to give a table for the state of new york
in which some districts are reduced and some increased
for the now ensuing draft
let the quotas stand as made by the enrolling officers
in the districts wherein this table requires them to be increased and let them be reduced according to the table in the others
this to be no precedent for subsequent action
as i think this report may
on full consideration
be shown to have much that is valuable in it
i suggest that such consideration be given it
and that it be especially considered whether its suggestions can be conformed to without an alteration of the law

my dear sir
i would have taken time to answer yours of the 22d inst
only that i did not suppose any evil could result from the delay
especially as
by a note
i promptly acknowledged the receipt of yours
and promised a fuller answer
on consideration i find there is really very little to say
my knowledge of mr
pomeroy's letter having been made public came to me only the day you wrote but i had
in spite of myself
known of its existence several days before
i have not yet read it
and i think i shall not
i was not shocked or surprised by the appearance of the letter
because i had had knowledge of mr
pomeroy's committee
and of secret issues which
i supposed
came from it
and of secret agents who
i supposed
were sent out by it for several weeks
i have known just as little a these things as my friends have allowed me to know
they bring the documents to me
but i do not read them they tell me what they think fit to tell me
but i do not inquire for more
i fully concur with you that neither of us can justly be held responsible for what our respective friends may do without our instigation or countenance and i assure you
as you have assured me
that no assault has been made upon you by my instigation
or with my countenance
whether you shall remain at the head of the treasury department is a question which i will not allow myself to consider from any standpoint other than my judgment of the public service
in that view
i do not perceive occasion for a change

which tobacco was supposed to have been purchased and paid for prior to the 4th day of march

which fact made it necessary to suspend the carrying into effect of the said order but whereas
pursuant to mutual explanations
a satisfactory understanding upon the subject has now been reached
it is directed that the order aforesaid may be carried into effect

i transmit the accompanying report from the secretary of the interior
containing the information called for
i deem it proper to add that on the 17th day of november last an executive order was made upon this subject and delivered to the vice president of the union pacific railroad company
which fixed the point on the western boundary of the state of iowa from which the company should construct their branch road to the one hundredth degree of west longitude
and declared it to be within the limits of the township in iowa opposite the town of omaha
in nebraska
since then the company has represented to me that upon actual surveys made it has determined upon the precise point of departure of their said branch road from the missouri river
and located the same as described in the accompanying report of the secretary of the interior
which point is within the limits designated in the order of november last and inasmuch as that order is not of record in any of the executive departments
and the company having desired a more definite one

my dear sir
i congratulate you on having fixed your name in history as the first free state governor of louisiana
you are about to have a convention
which among other things will probably define the elective franchise
i barely suggest for your private consideration
whether some of the colored people may not be let in
for instance
the very intelligent
and especially those who have fought gallantly in our ranks
they would probably help
in some trying time to come
to keep the jewel of liberty within the family of freedom
but this is only a suggestion
not to the public
but to you alone
yours truly

remarks at a fair in the patent office
march 16
ladies and gentlemen
i appear to say but a word
this extraordinary war in which we are engaged falls heavily upon all classes of people but the most heavily upon the soldier
for it has been said
all that a man hath will he give for his life and while all contribute of their substance
the soldier puts his life at stake
and often yields it up in his country's cause
the highest merit
is due to the soldier
in this extraordinary war
extraordinary developments have manifested themselves
such as have not been seen in former wars and among these manifestations nothing has been more remarkable than these fairs for the relief of suffering soldiers and their families
and the chief agents of these fairs are the women of america
i am not accustomed to the use of language of eulogy
i have never studied the art of paying compliments to women but i must say
that if all that has been said by orators and poets since the creation of the world in praise of women were applied to the women of america
it would not do them justice for their conduct during this war
i will close by saying
god bless the women of america
reply to a committee from the workingmen's association of new york
march 21
gentlemen of the committee
the honorary membership in your association
as generously tendered
is gratefully accepted
you comprehend
as your address shows
that the existing rebellion means more and tends to do more than the perpetuation of african slavery that it is
in fact
a war upon the rights of all working people
partly to show that this view has not escaped my attention
and partly that i cannot better express myself
i read a passage from the message to congress in december
it continues to develop that the insurrection is largely
if not exclusively
a war upon the first principle of popular government
the rights of the people
conclusive evidence of this is found in the most grave and maturely considered public documents
as well as in the general tone of the insurgents
in those documents we find the abridgment of the existing right of suffrage
and the denial to the people of all right to participate in the selection of public officers
except the legislature
boldly advocated
with labored argument to prove that large control of the people in government is the source of all political evil
monarchy itself is sometimes hinted at as a possible refuge from the power of the people
in my present position i could scarcely be justified were i to omit raising a warning voice against this approach of returning despotism
it is not needed
nor fitting here
that a general argument should be made in favor of popular institutions but there is one point
with its connections
not so hackneyed as most others
to which i ask a brief attention
it is the effort to place capital on an equal footing
if not above labor
in the structure of government
it is assumed that labor is available only in connection with capital that nobody labors unless somebody else
owning capital
somehow by the use of it induces him to labor
this assumed
it is next considered whether it is best that capital shall hire laborers
and thus induce them to work by their own consent or buy them
and drive them to it without their consent
having proceeded so it is naturally concluded that all laborers are either hired laborers
or what we call slaves
it is assumed that whoever is once a hired laborer
is fixed in that condition for life
now there is no such relation between capital and labor as assumed
nor is there any such thing as a free man being fixed for life in the condition of a hired laborer
both these assumptions are false
and all inferences from them are groundless
labor is prior to
and independent of
capital is only the fruit of labor
and could never have existed if labor had not first existed
labor is the superior of capital
and deserves much the higher consideration
capital has its rights
which are as worthy of protection as any other rights
nor is it denied that there is
and probably always will be
a relation between capital and labor
producing mutual benefits
the error is in assuming that the whole labor of a community exists within that relation
a few men own capital
and that few avoid labor themselves
with their capital
hire or buy another few to labor for them
a large majority belong to neither class neither work for others
nor have others working for them
in most of the southern states
a majority of the whole people
of all colors
are neither slaves nor masters while in the northern
a large majority are neither hirers nor hired
men with their families
and daughters work for themselves
on their farms
in their houses
and in their shops
taking the whole product to themselves
and asking no favors of capital on the one hand
nor of hired laborers or slaves on the other
it is not forgotten that a considerable number of persons mingle their own labor with capital that is
they labor with their own hands
and also buy or hire others to labor for them
but this is only a mixed and not a distinct class
no principle stated is disturbed by the existence of this mixed class
as has already been said
there is not
of necessity
any such thing as the free hired laborer being fixed to that condition for life
many independent men everywhere in these states
a few years back in their lives
were hired laborers
the prudent penniless beginner in the world labors for wages a while
saves a surplus with which to buy tools or land for himself
then labors on his own account another while
and at length hires another new beginner to help him
this is the just and generous and prosperous system which opens the way to all gives hope to all
and consequent energy and progress
and improvement of condition to all
no men living are more worthy to be trusted than those who toil up from poverty none less inclined to touch or take aught which they have not honestly earned
let them beware of surrendering a political power they already possess
and which
if surrendered
will surely be used to close the door of advancement against such as they
and to fix new disabilities and burdens upon them
till all of liberty shall be lost
the views then expressed remain unchanged
nor have i much to add
none are so deeply interested to resist the present rebellion as the working people
let them beware of prejudices
working division and hostility among themselves
the most notable feature of a disturbance in your city last summer was the hanging of some working people by other working people
it should never be so
the strongest bond of human sympathy
outside of the family relation
should be one uniting all working people
of all nations
and tongues
and kindreds
nor should this lead to a war upon property
or the owners of property
property is the fruit of labor property is desirable is a positive good in the world
that some should be rich shows that others may become rich
is just encouragement to industry and enterprise
let not him who is houseless pull down the house of another
but let him labor diligently and build one for himself
thus by example assuring that his own shall be safe from violence when built

my dear sir
yours of february 29 reached me only four days ago but the delay was of little consequence
because i found
on feeling around
i could not invite you here without a difficulty which at least would be unpleasant
and perhaps would be detrimental to the public service
allow me to suggest that if you wish to remain in the military service
it is very dangerous for you to get temporarily out of it because
with a major general once out
it is next to impossible for even the president to get him in again
with my appreciation of your ability and correct principle
of course i would be very glad to have your service for the country in the approaching political canvass but i fear we cannot properly have it without separating you from the military

proclamation about amnesty
march 26
by the president of the united states of america
a proclamation
it has become necessary to define the cases in which insurgent enemies are entitled to the benefits of the proclamation of the president of the united states
which was made on the 8th day of december
and the manner in which they shall proceed to avail themselves of these benefits and whereas the objects of that proclamation were to suppress the insurrection and to restore the authority of the united states and whereas the amnesty therein proposed by the president was offered with reference to these objects alone
abraham lincoln
president of the united states
do hereby proclaim and declare that the said proclamation does not apply to the cases of persons who
at the time when they seek to obtain the benefits thereof by taking the oath thereby prescribed
are in military
or civil confinement or custody
or under bonds
or on parole of the civil
or naval authorities
or agents of the united states
as prisoners of war
or persons detained for offences of any kind
either before or after conviction and that on the contrary it does apply only to those persons who
being yet at large
and free from any arrest
or duress
shall voluntarily come forward and take the said oath
with the purpose of restoring peace
and establishing the national authority
persons excluded from the amnesty offered in the said proclamation may apply to the president for clemency
like all other offenders
and their application will receive due consideration
i do further declare and proclaim that the oath presented in the aforesaid proclamation of the 8th of december
may be taken and subscribed before any commissioned officer
or naval
in the service of the united states
or any civil or military officer of a state or territory not in insurrection
by the laws thereof
may be qualified for administering oaths
all officers who receive such oaths are hereby authorized to give certificates thereof to the persons respectively by whom they are made
and such officers are hereby required to transmit the original records of such oaths
at as early a day as may be convenient
to the department of state
where they will be deposited
and remain in the archives of the government
the secretary of state will keep a registry thereof
and will
on application
in proper cases
issue certificates of such records in the customary form of official certificates
in testimony whereof i have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the united states to be affixed
by the president

secretary of war
my dear sir
the governor of kentucky is here
and desires to have the following points definitely fixed
that the quotas of troops furnished
and to be furnished
by kentucky may be adjusted upon the basis as actually reduced by able bodied men of hers having gone into the rebel service and that she be required to furnish no more than her just quotas upon fair adjustment upon such basis
to whatever extent the enlistment and drafting
one or both
of colored troops may be found necessary within the state
it may be conducted within the law of congress and
so far as practicable
free from collateral embarrassments
and provocations
i think these requests of the governor are reasonable and i shall be obliged if you will give him a full hearing
and do the best you can to effect these objects

my dear sir
your letter to colonel townsend
inclosing a slip from the herald

has been laid before me by the secretary of war

it is quite natural that you should feel some sensibility on the subject yet i am not impressed
nor do i think the country is impressed
with the belief that your honor demands
or the public interest demands
such an inquiry
the country knows that at all events you have done good service and i believe it agrees with me that it is much better for you to be engaged in trying to do more
than to be diverted

and some others
agreed last night that i should
by this despatch
kindly call your attention to captain kinney
to a
executive mansion
april 4
my dear sir
you ask me to put in writing the substance of what i verbally said the other day
in your presence
to governor bramlette and senator dixon
it was about as follows
i am naturally anti slavery
if slavery is not wrong
nothing is wrong
i cannot remember when i did not so think and feel
and yet i have never understood that the presidency conferred upon me an unrestricted right to act officially upon this judgment and feeling
it was in the oath i took that i would to the best of my ability preserve
and defend the constitution of the united states
i could not take the office without taking the oath
nor was it my view that i might take an oath to get power
and break the oath in using the power
i understood
that in ordinary civil administration this oath even forbade me to practically indulge my primary abstract judgment on the moral question of slavery
i had publicly declared this many times
and in many ways
and i aver that
to this day
i have done no official act in mere deference to my abstract judgment and feeling on slavery
i did understand
that my oath to preserve the constitution to the best of my ability
imposed upon me the duty of preserving
by every indispensable means
that government
that nation
of which that constitution was the organic law
was it possible to lose the nation and yet preserve the constitution
by general law
life and limb must be protected yet often a limb must be amputated to save a life but a life is never wisely given to save a limb
i felt that measures
otherwise unconstitutional
might become lawful
by becoming indispensable to the preservation of the constitution
through the preservation of the nation
right or wrong
i assumed this ground
and now avow it
i could not feel that to the best of my ability i had even tried to preserve the constitution
to save slavery
or any minor matter
i should permit the wreck of government
and constitution
early in the war
general fremont attempted military emancipation
i forbade it
because i did not then think it an indispensable necessity
a little later
general cameron
then secretary of war
suggested the arming of the blacks
i objected
because i did not yet think it an indispensable necessity
still later
general hunter attempted military emancipation
i again forbade it
because i did not yet think the indispensable necessity had come
in march
and may
and july
i made earnest and successive appeals to the border states to favor compensated emancipation
i believed the indispensable necessity for military emancipation and arming the blacks would come
unless averted by that measure
they declined the proposition
and i was
in my best judgment
driven to the alternative of either surrendering the union
and with it the constitution
or of laying strong hand upon the colored element
i chose the latter
in choosing it
i hoped for greater gain than loss
but of this i was not entirely confident
more than a year of trial now shows no loss by it in our foreign relations
none in our home popular sentiment
none in our white military force
no loss by it any how
or anywhere
on the contrary
it shows a gain of quite one hundred and thirty thousand soldiers
and laborers
these are palpable facts
about which
as facts
there can be no caviling
we have the men and we could not have had them without the measure
and now let any union man who complains of the measure test himself by writing down in one line that he is for subduing the rebellion by force of arms and in the next
that he is for taking these hundred and thirty thousand men from the union side
and placing them where they would be but for the measure he condemns
if he cannot face his case so stated
it is only because he cannot face the truth
i add a word which was not in the verbal conversation
in telling this tale i attempt no compliment to my own sagacity
i claim not to have controlled events
but confess plainly that events have controlled me
at the end of three years' struggle
the nation's condition is not what either party
or any man
devised or expected
god alone can claim it
whither it is tending seems plain
if god now wills the removal of a great wrong
and wills also that we of the north
as well as you of the south
shall pay fairly for our complicity in that wrong
impartial history will find therein new cause to attest and revere the justice and goodness of god

lecture on liberty address at sanitary fair in baltimore
april 18
ladies and gentlemen
calling to mind that we are in baltimore
we cannot fail to note that the world moves
looking upon these many people assembled here to serve
as they best may
the soldiers of the union
it occurs at once that three years ago the same soldiers could not so much as pass through baltimore
the change from then till now is both great and gratifying
blessings on the brave men who have wrought the change
and the fair women who strive to reward them for it
but baltimore suggests more than could happen within baltimore
the change within baltimore is part only of a far wider change
when the war began
three years ago
neither party
nor any man
expected it would last till now
each looked for the end
in some way
long ere to day
neither did any anticipate that domestic slavery would be much affected by the war
but here we are the war has not ended
and slavery has been much affected how much needs not now to be recounted
so true is it that man proposes and god disposes
but we can see the past
though we may not claim to have directed it and seeing it
in this case
we feel more hopeful and confident for the future
the world has never had a good definition of the word liberty
and the american people
just now
are much in want of one
we all declare for liberty but in using the same word we do not all mean the same thing
with some the word liberty may mean for each man to do as he pleases with himself
and the product of his labor while with others the same word may mean for some men to do as they please with other men
and the product of other men's labor
here are two
not only different
but incompatible things
called by the same name
and it follows that each of the things is
by the respective parties
called by two different and incompatible names liberty and tyranny
the shepherd drives the wolf from the sheep's throat
for which the sheep thanks the shepherd as his liberator
while the wolf denounces him for the same act
as the destroyer of liberty
especially as the sheep was a black one
the sheep and the wolf are not agreed upon a definition of the word liberty and precisely the same difference prevails to day among us human creatures
even in the north
and all professing to love liberty
hence we behold the process by which thousands are daily passing from under the yoke of bondage hailed by some as the advance of liberty
and bewailed by others as the destruction of all liberty
as it seems
the people of maryland have been doing something to define liberty
and thanks to them that
in what they have done
the wolf's dictionary has been repudiated
it is not very becoming for one in my position to make speeches at length but there is another subject upon which i feel that i ought to say a word
a painful rumor
i fear
has reached us
of the massacre
by the rebel forces at fort pillow
in the west end of tennessee
on the mississippi river
of some three hundred colored soldiers and white officers i believe it latter turned out to be 500
who had just been overpowered by their assailants numbering 5000
there seems to be some anxiety in the public mind whether the government is doing its duty to the colored soldier
and to the service
at this point
at the beginning of the war
and for some time
the use of colored troops was not contemplated and how the change of purpose was wrought i will not now take time to explain
upon a clear conviction of duty i resolved to turn that element of strength to account and i am responsible for it to the american people
to the christian world
to history
and in my final account to god
having determined to use the negro as a soldier
there is no way but to give him all the protection given to any other soldier
the difficulty is not in stating the principle
but in practically applying it
it is a mistake to suppose the government is indifferent to this matter
or is not doing the best it can in regard to it
we do not to day know that a colored soldier
or white officer commanding colored soldiers
has been massacred by the rebels when made a prisoner
we fear it
we believe it
i may say
but we do not know it
to take the life of one of their prisoners on the assumption that they murder ours
when it is short of certainty that they do murder ours
might be too serious
too cruel
a mistake
we are having the fort pillow affair thoroughly investigated and such investigation will probably show conclusively how the truth is
if after all that has been said it shall turn out that there has been no massacre at fort pillow
it will be almost safe to say there has been none
and will be none
if there has been the massacre of three hundred there
or even the tenth part of three hundred
it will be conclusively proved and being so proved
the retribution shall as surely come
it will be matter of grave consideration in what exact course to apply the retribution but in the supposed case it must come
there was a massacre of a black company and their officers at fort pillow they were prisoners who later on
the day of their capture
were ordered executed
the black soldiers were tied alive to individual planks then man and plank were cobbled up like cord wood and burned
the white officers were shot

to the honorable the senate and house of representatives
i have the honor to transmit herewith an address to the president of the united states
and through him to both houses of congress
on the condition and wants of the people of east tennessee
and asking their attention to the necessity of some action on the part of the government for their relief
and which address is presented by a committee of an organization called the east tennessee relief association
deeply commiserating the condition of these most loyal and suffering people
i am unprepared to make any specific recommendation for their relief
the military is doing and will continue to do the best for them within its power
their address represents that the construction of direct railroad communication between knoxville and cincinnati by way of central kentucky would be of great consequence in the present emergency
it may be remembered that in the annual message of december
such railroad construction was recommended
i now add that
with the hearty concurrence of congress
i would yet be pleased to construct a road
both for the relief of these people and for its continuing military importance

and in the march to the relief of knoxville
which occurred in the latter days of november and early days of december last
and of course was not present at the assembling of congress
when he subsequently arrived here
he sought
and was allowed by the secretary of war and the executive
the same conditions and promise as allowed and made to general schenck
general schenck has not applied to withdraw his resignation but when general grant was made lieutenant general
producing some change of commanders
general blair sought to be assigned to the command of a corps
this was made known to generals grant and sherman
and assented to by them
and the particular corps for him designated
this was all arranged and understood
as now remembered
so much as a month ago but the formal withdrawal of general blair's resignation
and making the order assigning him to the command of the corps
were not consummated at the war department until last week
perhaps on the 23d of april instant
as a summary of the whole
it may be stated that general blair holds no military commission or appointment other than as herein stated
and that it is believed he is now acting as major general upon the assumed validity of the commission herein stated
in connection with the facts herein stated
and not otherwise
there are some letters
and perhaps other documents in connection with this subject
which it is believed would throw no additional light upon it
but which will be cheerfully furnished if desired

not expecting to see you before the spring campaign opens
i wish to express in this way my entire satisfaction with what you have done up to this time
so far as i understand it
the particulars of your plans i neither know nor seek to know
you are vigilant and self reliant and
pleased with this
i wish not to obtrude any restraints or constraints upon you
while i am very anxious that any great disaster or capture of our men in great number shall be avoided
i know that these points are less likely to escape your attention than they would be mine
if there be anything wanting which is within my power to give
do not fail to let me know it
and now
with a brave army and a just cause
may god sustain you

1864 to the friends of union and liberty
enough is known of army operations
within the last five days
to claim our special gratitude to god
while what remains undone demands our most sincere prayers to and reliance upon him without whom all effort is vain
i recommend that all patriots at their homes
in their places of public worship
and wherever they may be
unite in common thanksgiving and prayer to almighty god
response to a serenade
may 9
i am very much obliged to you for the compliment of this call
though i apprehend it is owing more to the good news received to day from the army
than to a desire to see me
i am indeed very grateful to the brave men who have been struggling with the enemy in the field
to their noble commanders who have directed them
and especially to our maker
our commanders are following up their victories resolutely and successfully
i think
without knowing the particulars of the plans of general grant
that what has been accomplished is of more importance than at first appears
i believe
i know and am especially grateful to know that general grant has not been jostled in his purposes
that he has made all his points
and to day he is on his line as he purposed before he moved his armies
i will volunteer to say that i am very glad at what has happened
but there is a great deal still to be done
while we are grateful to all the brave men and officers for the events of the past few days
we should
above all
be very grateful to almighty god
who gives us victory
there is enough yet before us requiring all loyal men and patriots to perform their share of the labor and follow the example of the modest general at the head of our armies
and sink all personal consideration for the sake of the country
i commend you to keep yourselves in the same tranquil mood that is characteristic of that brave and loyal man
i have said more than i expected when i came before you
repeating my thanks for this call

my dear sir
i have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your communication of the 28th april
in which you offer to replace the present garrison at port trumbull with volunteers
which you propose to raise at your own expense
while it seems inexpedient at this time to accept this proposition on account of the special duties now devolving upon the garrison mentioned
i cannot pass unnoticed such a meritorious instance of individual patriotism
permit me
for the government
to express my cordial thanks to you for this generous and public spirited offer
which is worthy of note among the many called forth in these times of national trial
i am very truly
your obedient servant

i would utter nothing which might in the least appear invidious against any
yet without this
it may fairly be said
that the methodist episcopal church
not less devoted than the best
is by its greatest numbers the most important of all
it is no fault in others that the methodist church sends more soldiers to the field
more nurses to the hospitals
and more prayers to heaven than any other
god bless the methodist church bless all the churches and blessed be god
who in this our great trial giveth us the churches

major general john a
commanding at new york
whereas there has been wickedly and traitorously printed and published this morning in the new york world and new york journal of commerce
newspapers printed and published in the city of new york
a false and spurious proclamation purporting to be signed by the president and to be countersigned by the secretary of state
which publication is of a treasonable nature
designed to give aid and comfort to the enemies of the united states and to the rebels now at war against the government and their aiders and abettors
you are therefore hereby commanded forthwith to arrest and imprison in any fort or military prison in your command
the editors
and publishers of the aforesaid newspapers
and all such persons as
after public notice has been given of the falsehood of said publication
print and publish the same with intent to give aid and comfort to the enemy and you will hold the persons so arrested in close custody until they can be brought to trial before a military commission for their offense
you will also take possession by military force of the printing establishments of the new york world and journal of commerce
and hold the same until further orders
and prohibit any further publication therefrom

order concerning the exemption of american consuls from military service may 19
it is officially announced by the state department that citizens of the united states holding commissions and recognized as consuls of foreign powers
are not by law exempt from military service if drafted
therefore the mere enrolment of a citizen holding a foreign consulate will not be held to vacate his commission
but if he shall be drafted his exequatur will be revoked unless he shall have previously resigned in order that another consul may be received
an exequatur bearing date the 3d day of may
having been issued to charles hunt
a citizen of the united states
recognizing him as a consul of belgium for st
and declaring him free to exercise and enjoy such functions
and privileges as are allowed to the consuls of the most favored nations in the united states
and the said hunt having sought to screen himself from his military duty to his country
in consequence of thus being invested with the consular functions of a foreign power in the united states
it is deemed advisable that the said charles hunt should no longer be permitted to continue in the exercise of said functions
and privileges
these are therefore to declare that i no longer recognize the said hunt as consul of belgium
for st
and will not permit him to exercise or enjoy any of the functions
powers or privileges allowed to consuls of that nation
and that i do hereby wholly revoke and annul the said exequatur heretofore given
and do declare the same to be absolutely null and void from this day forward

i have caused these letters to be made patent

memorandum concerning the transportation of the new york naval brigade
executive mansion
may 26
whom it may concern
i am again pressed with the claim of mr
marshall o
for transportation of what was called the naval brigade from new york to fortress monroe
this force was a special organization got up by one bartlett
in pretended pursuance of written authority from me
but in fact
pursuing the authority in scarcely anything whatever
the credit given him by mr
was given in the teeth of the express declaration that the government would not be responsible for the class of expenses to which it belonged
after all some part of the transportation became useful to the government
and equitably should be paid for but i have neither time nor means to ascertain this equitable amount
or any appropriation to pay it with if ascertained
if the quartermaster at new york can ascertain what would compensate for so much of the transportation as did result usefully to the government
it might be a step towards reaching justice
i write this from memory
but i believe it is substantially correct

he and his brave soldiers are now in the midst of their great trial
and i trust that at your meeting you will so shape your good words that they may turn to men and guns
moving to his and their support

june 9
chairman and gentlemen of the committee
i will neither conceal my gratification nor restrain the expression of my gratitude that the union people
through their convention
in their continued effort to save and advance the nation
have deemed me not unworthy to remain in my present position
i know no reason to doubt that i shall accept the nomination tendered and yet perhaps i should not declare definitely before reading and considering what is called the platform
i will say now
i approve the declaration in favor of so amending the constitution as to prohibit slavery throughout the nation
when the people in revolt
with a hundred days of explicit notice that they could within those days resume their allegiance without the overthrow of their institution
and that they could not so resume it afterward
elected to stand out
such amendment of the constitution as now proposed became a fitting and necessary conclusion to the final success of the union cause
such alone can meet and cover all cavils
now the unconditional union men
north and south
perceive its importance and embrace it
in the joint names of liberty and union
let us labor to give it legal form and practical effect
platform of the union national convention held in baltimore
june 7 and 8
that it is the highest duty of every american citizen to maintain against all their enemies the integrity of the union and the paramount authority of the constitution and laws of the united states and that
laying aside all differences of political opinion
we pledge ourselves
as union men
animated by a common sentiment and aiming at a common object
to do everything in our power to aid the government in quelling by force of arms the rebellion now raging against its authority
and in bringing to the punishment due to their crimes the rebels and traitors arrayed against it
that we approve the determination of the government of the united states not to compromise with rebels
or to offer them any terms of peace
except such as may be based upon an unconditional surrender of their hostility and a return to their just allegiance to the constitution and laws of the united states
and that we call upon the government to maintain this position
and to prosecute the war with the utmost possible vigor to the complete suppression of the rebellion
in full reliance upon the self sacrificing patriotism
the heroic valor
and the undying devotion of the american people to their country and its free institutions
that as slavery was the cause
and now constitutes the strength
of this rebellion
and as it must be
always and everywhere
hostile to the principles of republican government
justice and the national safety demand its utter and complete extirpation from the soil of the republic and that while we uphold and maintain the acts and proclamations by which the government
in its own defense
has aimed a death blow at this gigantic evil
we are in favor
of such an amendment to the constitution
to be made by the people in conformity with its provisions
as shall terminate and forever prohibit the existence of slavery within the limits or the jurisdiction of the united states
that the thanks of the american people are due to the soldiers and sailors of the army and navy
who have periled their lives in defense of their country and in vindication of the honor of its flag that the nation owes to them some permanent recognition of their patriotism and their valor
and ample and permanent provision for those of their survivors who have received disabling and honorable wounds in the service of the country and that the memories of those who have fallen in its defense shall be held in grateful and everlasting remembrance
that we approve and applaud the practical wisdom
the unselfish patriotism
and the unswerving fidelity to the constitution and the principles of american liberty
with which abraham lincoln has discharged under circumstances of unparalleled difficulty the great duties and responsibilities of the presidential office that we approve and indorse as demanded by the emergency and essential to the preservation of the nation
and as within the provisions of the constitution
the measures and acts which he has adopted to defend the nation against its open and secret foes that we approve
the proclamation of emancipation
and the employment as union soldiers of men heretofore held in slavery and that we have full confidence in his determination to carry these and all other constitutional measures essential to the salvation of the country into full and complete effect
that we deem it essential to the general welfare that harmony should prevail in the national councils
and we regard as worthy of public confidence and official trust those only who cordially indorse the principles proclaimed in these resolutions
and which should characterize the administration of the government
that the government owes to all men employed in its armies
without regard to distinction of color
the full protection of the laws of war
and that any violation of these laws
or of the usages of civilized nations in time of war
by the rebels now in arms
should be made the subject of prompt and full redress
that foreign immigration
which in the past has added so much to the wealth
development of resources
and increase of power to this nation
the asylum of the oppressed of all nations
should be fostered and encouraged by a liberal and just policy
that we are in favor of the speedy construction of the railroad to the pacific coast
that the national faith
pledged for the redemption of the public debt
must be kept inviolate
and that for this purpose we recommend economy and rigid responsibility in the public expenditures
and a vigorous and just system of taxation
and that it is the duty of every loyal state to sustain the credit and promote the use of the national currency
that we approve the position taken by the government that the people of the united states can never regard with indifference the attempt of any european power to overthrow by force or to supplant by fraud the institutions of any republican government on the western continent
and that they will view with extreme jealousy
as menacing to the peace and independence of their own country
the efforts of any such power to obtain new footholds for monarchical governments
sustained by foreign military force
in near proximity to the united states
reply to a delegation from the national union league
june 9
gentlemen i can only say in response to the remarks of your chairman
that i am very grateful for the renewed confidence which has been accorded to me
both by the convention and by the national league
i am not insensible at all to the personal compliment there is in this
yet i do not allow myself to believe that any but a small portion of it is to be appropriated as a personal compliment to me
the convention and the nation
i am assured
are alike animated by a higher view of the interests of the country
for the present and the great future
and the part i am entitled to appropriate as a compliment is only that part which i may lay hold of as being the opinion of the convention and of the league
that i am not entirely unworthy to be intrusted with the place i have occupied for the last three years
i have not permitted myself
to conclude that i am the best man in the country but i am reminded in this connection of a story of an old dutch farmer
who remarked to a companion once that it was not best to swap horses when crossing a stream

i suppose that you have done me this kindness in connection with the action of the baltimore convention
which has recently taken place
and with which
of course
i am very well satisfied
what we want still more than baltimore conventions
or presidential elections
is success under general grant
i propose that you constantly bear in mind that the support you owe to the brave officers and soldiers in the field is of the very first importance
and we should therefore bend all our energies to that point
now without detaining you any longer
i propose that you help me to close up what i am now saying with three rousing cheers for general grant and the officers and soldiers under his command
address to the envoy from the hawaiian islands

in every light in which the state of the hawaiian islands can be contemplated

address at a sanitary fair in philadelphia
june 16
i suppose that this toast is intended to open the way for me to say something
war at the best is terrible
and this of ours in its magnitude and duration is one of the most terrible the world has ever known
it has deranged business totally in many places
and perhaps in all
it has destroyed property
destroyed life
and ruined homes
it has produced a national debt and a degree of taxation unprecedented in the history of this country
it has caused mourning among us until the heavens may almost be said to be hung in black
and yet it continues
it has had accompaniments not before known in the history of the world
i mean the sanitary and christian commissions
with their labors for the relief of the soldiers
and the volunteer refreshment saloons
understood better by those who hear me than by myself
and these fairs
first begun at chicago and next held in boston
and other cities
the motive and object that lie at the bottom of them are worthy of the most that we can do for the soldier who goes to fight the battles of his country
from the fair and tender hand of women is much
very much
done for the soldier
continually reminding him of the care and thought for him at home
the knowledge that he is not forgotten is grateful to his heart
another view of these institutions is worthy of thought
they are voluntary contributions
giving proof that the national resources are not at all exhausted
and that the national patriotism will sustain us through all
it is a pertinent question
when is this war to end
i do not wish to name the day when it will end
lest the end should not come at the given time
we accepted this war
and did not begin it
we accepted it for an object
and when that object is accomplished the war will end
and i hope to god that it will never end until that object is accomplished
we are going through with our task
so far as i am concerned
if it takes us three years longer
i have not been in the habit of making predictions
but i am almost tempted now to hazard one
i will
it is
that grant is this evening in a position
with meade and hancock
of pennsylvania
whence he can never be dislodged by the enemy until richmond is taken
if i shall discover that general grant may be greatly facilitated in the capture of richmond by rapidly pouring to him a large number of armed men at the briefest notice
will you go
will you march on with him
cries of yes
then i shall call upon you when it is necessary

proclamation suspending the writ of habeas corpus
july 5
by the president of the united states
a proclamation
by a proclamation which was issued on the 15th day of april
the president of the united states announced and declared that the laws of the united states had been for some time past
and then were
opposed and the execution thereof obstructed in certain states therein mentioned
by combinations too powerful to be suppressed by the ordinary course of judicial proceedings or by the power vested in the marshals by law and whereas
immediately after the issuing of the said proclamation the land and naval forces of the united states were put into activity to suppress the said insurrections and rebellion and whereas
the congress of the united states
by an act approved on the third day of march
did enact that during the said rebellion the president of the united states
whenever in his judgment the public safety may require it
is authorized to suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus in any case throughout the united states
or any part thereof and whereas
the said insurrection and rebellion still continue
endangering the existence of the constitution and government of the united states and whereas
the military forces of the united states are now actively engaged in suppressing the said insurrection and rebellion in various parts of the states where the said rebellion has been successful in obstructing the laws and public authorities
especially in the states of virginia and georgia and whereas
on the fifteenth day of september last
the president of the united states duly issued his proclamation
wherein he declared that the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus should be suspended throughout the united states
in cases whereby the authority of the president of the united states
the military
and civil officers of the united states
or any of them
hold persons under their command or in their custody
either as prisoners of war
or aiders or abettors of the enemy
or officers
or seamen enrolled or drafted
or mustered
or enlisted in
or belonging to the land or naval forces of the united states
or as deserters therefrom
or otherwise amenable to military law
or the rules and articles of war
or the rules and regulations prescribed for the military and naval service by authority of the president of the united states
or for resisting a draft
or for any other offence against the military or naval service and whereas
many citizens of the state of kentucky have joined the forces of the insurgents
who have on several occasions entered the said state of kentucky in large force and not without aid and comfort furnished by disaffected and disloyal citizens of the united states residing therein
have not only greatly disturbed the public peace but have overborne the civil authorities and made flagrant civil war
destroying property and life in various parts of the state and whereas
it has been made known to the president of the united states
by the officers commanding the national armies
that combinations have been formed in the said state of kentucky
with a purpose of inciting the rebel forces to renew the said operations of civil war within the said state
and thereby to embarrass the united states armies now operating in the said states of virginia and georgia
and even to endanger their safety
abraham lincoln
president of the united states
by virtue of the authority vested in me by the constitution and laws
do hereby declare that in my judgment the public safety especially requires that the suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus so proclaimed in the said proclamation of the 15th of september
be made effectual and be duly enforced in and throughout the said state of kentucky
and that martial law be for the present declared therein
i do therefore hereby require of the military officers of the said state that the privilege of the habeas corpus be effectually suspended within the said state
according to the aforesaid proclamation
and that martial law be established therein to take effect from the date of this proclamation
the said suspension and establishment of martial law to continue until this proclamation shall be revoked or modified
but not beyond the period when the said rebellion shall have been suppressed or come to an end
and i do hereby require and command
as well as military officers
all civil officers and authorities existing or found within the said state of kentucky
to take notice of this proclamation and to give full effect to the same
the martial laws herein proclaimed and the things in that respect herein ordered will not be deemed or taken to interfere with the holding of lawful elections
or with the proceedings of the constitutional legislature of kentucky
or with the administration of justice in the courts of law existing therein between citizens of the united states in suits or proceedings which do not affect the military operations or the constituted authorities of the government of the united states
in testimony whereof i have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the united states to be affixed

proclamation for a day of prayer
july 7
by the president of the united states of america
a proclamation
the senate and house of representatives at their last session adopted a concurrent resolution
which was approved on the second day of july instant
and which was in the words following
that the president of the united states be requested to appoint a day of humiliation and prayer by the people of the united states
that he request his constitutional advisers at the head of the executive departments to unite with him
as chief magistrate of the nation
at the city of washington
and the members of congress
and all magistrates
all civil
and naval officers
all soldiers
and marines
with all loyal and law abiding people
to convene at their usual places of worship
or wherever they may be
to confess and to repent of their manifold sins
to implore the compassion and forgiveness of the almighty
if consistent with his will
the existing rebellion may be speedily suppressed
and the supremacy of the constitution and laws of the united states may be established throughout all the states to implore him
as the supreme ruler of the world
not to destroy us as a people
nor suffer us to be destroyed by the hostility or connivance of other nations
or by obstinate adhesion to our own counsels which may be in conflict with his eternal
and to implore him to enlighten the mind of the nation to know and do his will
humbly believing that it is in accordance with his will that our place should be maintained as a united people among the family of nations to implore him to grant to our armed defenders
and the masses of the people
that courage
power of resistance
and endurance necessary to secure that result to implore him in his infinite goodness to soften the hearts
enlighten the minds
and quicken the conscience of those in rebellion
that they may lay down their arms
and speedily return to their allegiance to the united states
that they may not be utterly destroyed
that the effusion of blood may be stayed
and that unity and fraternity may be restored
and peace established throughout all our borders
abraham lincoln
president of the united states
cordially concurring with the congress of the united states
in the penitential and pious sentiments expressed in the aforesaid resolutions
and heartily approving of the devotional design and purpose thereof
do hereby appoint the first thursday of august next to be observed by the people of the united states as a day of national humiliation and prayer
i do hereby further invite and request the heads of the executive departments of this government
together with all legislators
all judges and magistrates
and all other persons exercising authority in the land
whether civil
or naval
and all soldiers
and marines in the national service
and all other loyal and law abiding people of the united states
to assemble in their preferred places of public worship on that day
and there to render to the almighty and merciful ruler of the universe
such homage and such confessions
and to offer to him such supplications as the congress of the united states have
in their aforesaid resolution
so solemnly
so earnestly
and so reverently recommended
in testimony whereof
i have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the united states to be affixed
done at the city of washington this seventh day of july
in the year of our lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty four

by the president william h

proclamation concerning a bill to guarantee to certain states
whose governments have been usurped or overthrown
a republican form of government
and concerning reconstruction
july 8
by the president of the united states
a proclamation
whereas at the late session congress passed a bill to guarantee to certain states whose governments have been usurped or overthrown a republican form of government
a copy of which is hereunto annexed and whereas
the said bill was presented to the president of the united states for his approval less than one hour before the sine die adjournment of said session
and was not signed by him and whereas the said bill contains
among other things
a plan for restoring the states in rebellion to their proper practical relation in the union
which plan expresses the sense of congress upon that subject
and which plan it is now thought fit to lay before the people for their consideration
abraham lincoln
president of the united states
do proclaim
and make known that while i am as i was in december last
by proclamation
i propounded a plan for restoration unprepared by a formal approval of this bill to be inflexibly committed to any single plan of restoration
and while i am also unprepared to declare that the free state constitutions and governments already adopted and installed in arkansas and louisiana shall be set aside and held for naught
thereby repelling and discouraging the loyal citizens who have set up the same as to further effort
or to declare a constitutional competency in congress to abolish slavery in states
but am at the same time sincerely hoping and expecting that a constitutional amendment abolishing slavery throughout the nation may be adopted
nevertheless i am fully satisfied with the system for restoration contained in the bill as one very proper plan for the loyal people of any state choosing to adopt it
and that i am and at all times shall be prepared to give the executive aid and assistance to any such people so soon as the military resistance to the united states shall have been suppressed in any such states and the people thereof shall have sufficiently returned to their obedience to the constitution and the laws of the united states
in which cases militia governors will be appointed with directions to proceed according to the bill
in testimony whereof i have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the united states to be affixed

with some odds and ends

what we shall get in from pennsylvania and new york will scarcely be worth counting

that you should provide to retain your hold where you are

yours of this morning received
you misconceive
the order you complain of was only nominally mine
and was framed by those who really made it with no thought of making you a scapegoat
it seemed to be general grant's wish that the forces under general wright and those under you should join and drive at the enemy under general wright
wright had the larger part of the force
but you had the rank
it was thought that you would prefer crook's commanding your part to your serving in person under wright

i have seen your despatches objecting to agents of northern states opening recruiting stations near your camps
an act of congress authorizes this
giving the appointment of agents to the states
and not to the executive government
it is not for the war department
or myself
to restrain or modify the law
in its execution
further than actual necessity may require
to be candid
i was for the passage of the law
not apprehending at the time that it would produce such inconvenience to the armies in the field as you now cause me to fear
many of the states were very anxious for it
and i hoped that
with their state bounties
and active exertions
they would get out substantial additions to our colored forces
unlike white recruits
help us where they come from
as well as where they go to
i still hope advantage from the law and being a law
it must be treated as such by all of us

it is provided that the president of the united states may
at his discretion
at any time hereafter
call for any number of men
as volunteers for the respective terms of one
and three years for military service
and that in case the quota or any part thereof of any town
ward of a city
or election district
or of a county not so subdivided
shall not be filled within the space of fifty days after such call
then the president shall immediately order a draft for one year to fill such quota or any part thereof which may be unfilled and whereas the new enrolment heretofore ordered is so far completed as that the aforementioned act of congress may now be put in operation for recruiting and keeping up the strength of the armies in the field
for garrisons
and such military operations as may be required for the purpose of suppressing the rebellion and restoring the authority of the united states government in the insurgent states
abraham lincoln
president of the united states
do issue this my last call for five hundred thousand volunteers for the military service
that this call shall be reduced by all credits which may be established under section eight of the aforesaid act on account of persons who have entered the naval service during the present rebellion and by credits for men furnished to the military service in excess of calls heretofore made
volunteers will be accepted under this call for one
or three years
as they may elect
and will be entitled to the bounty provided by the law for the period of services for which they enlist
and i hereby proclaim
and direct that immediately after the 5th day of september
being fifty days from the date of this call
a draft for troops to serve for one year shall be had in every town
ward of a city

to fill the quota which shall be assigned to it under this call or any part thereof which may be unfilled by volunteers on the said 5th day of september

upon request made on behalf of mr

i have just seen yours complaining of the appointment of hovey and osterhaus
the point you make is unquestionably a good one
and yet please hear a word from us
my recollection is that both general grant and yourself recommended both h ovey and o sterhaus for promotion
and these
with other strong recommendations
drew committals from us which we could neither honorably or safely disregard
we blamed h ovey for coming away in the manner in which he did
but he knew he had apparent reason to feel disappointed and mortified
and we felt it was not best to crush one who certainly had been a good soldier
as to osterhaus
we did not know of his leaving at the time we made the appointment
and do not now know the terms on which he left
not to have appointed him
as the case appeared to us at the time
would have been almost
if not quite
a violation of our word
the word was given on what we thought was high merit and somewhat on his nationality
i beg you to believe we do not act in a spirit of disregarding merit
we expect to await your programme for further changes and promotions in your army

it will neither be done nor attempted

why can't you seek seclusion

ah
said the president
two or three weeks would do me no good
i cannot fly from my thoughts my solicitude for this great country follows me wherever i go
i do not think it is personal vanity or ambition
though i am not free from these infirmities
but i cannot but feel that the weal or woe of this great nation will be decided in november
there is no program offered by any wing of the democratic party but that must result in the permanent destruction of the union
but
general mcclellan is in favor of crushing out this rebellion by force
he will be the chicago candidate
sir
the slightest knowledge of arithmetic will prove to any man that the rebel armies cannot be destroyed by democratic strategy
it would sacrifice all the white men of the north to do it
there are now in the service of the united states nearly one hundred and fifty thousand able bodied colored men
most of them under arms
defending and acquiring union territory
the democratic strategy demands that these forces be disbanded
and that the masters be conciliated by restoring them to slavery
the black men who now assist union prisoners to escape are to be converted into our enemies
in the vain hope of gaining the good will of their masters
we shall have to fight two nations instead of one
you cannot conciliate the south if you guarantee to them ultimate success and the experience of the present war proves their success is inevitable if you fling the compulsory labor of millions of black men into their side of the scale
will you give our enemies such military advantages as insure success
and then depend on coaxing
and concession to get them back into the union
abandon all the posts now garrisoned by black men
take one hundred and fifty thousand men from our side and put them in the battle field or corn field against us
and we would be compelled to abandon the war in three weeks
we have to hold territory in inclement and sickly places where are the democrats to do this
it was a free fight
and the field was open to the war democrats to put down this rebellion by fighting against both master and slave
long before the present policy was inaugurated
there have been men base enough to propose to me to return to slavery the black warriors of port hudson and olustee
and thus win the respect of the masters they fought
should i do so
i should deserve to be damned in time and eternity
come what will
i will keep my faith with friend and foe
my enemies pretend i am now carrying on this war for the sole purpose of abolition
so long as i am president
it shall be carried on for the sole purpose of restoring the union
but no human power can subdue this rebellion without the use of the emancipation policy
and every other policy calculated to weaken the moral and physical forces of the rebellion
freedom has given us one hundred and fifty thousand men
raised on southern soil
it will give us more yet
just so much it has subtracted from the enemy
instead of alienating the south
there are now evidences of a fraternal feeling growing up between our men and the rank and file of the rebel soldiers
let my enemies prove to the country that the destruction of slavery is not necessary to a restoration of the union
i will abide the issue

address to the 164th ohio regiment
august 18
you are about to return to your homes and your friends
after having
as i learn
performed in camp a comparatively short term of duty in this great contest
i am greatly obliged to you
and to all who have come forward at the call of their country
i wish it might be more generally and universally understood what the country is now engaged in
we have
as all will agree
a free government
where every man has a right to be equal with every other man
in this great struggle
this form of government and every form of human right is endangered if our enemies succeed
there is more involved in this contest than is realized by every one
there is involved in this struggle
the question whether your children and my children shall enjoy the privileges we have enjoyed
i say this
in order to impress upon you
if you are not already so impressed
that no small matter should divert us from our great purpose
there may be some inequalities in the practical application of our system
it is fair that each man shall pay taxes in exact proportion to the value of his property but if we should wait
before collecting a tax
to adjust the taxes upon each man in exact proportion with every other man
we should never collect any tax at all
there may be mistakes made sometimes and things may be done wrong
while the officers of the government do all they can to prevent mistakes
but i beg of you
as citizens of this great republic
not to let your minds be carried off from the great work we have before us
this struggle is too large for you to be diverted from it by any small matter
when you return to your homes
rise up to the height of a generation of men worthy of a free government
and we will carry out the great work we have commenced
i return to you my sincere thanks
for the honor you have done me this afternoon

for the services you have done in this great struggle in which we are engaged
i present you sincere thanks for myself and the country
i almost always feel inclined
when i say anything to soldiers
to impress upon them
in a few brief remarks
the importance of success in this contest
it is not merely for the day
but for all time to come
that we should perpetuate for our children's children that great and free government which we have enjoyed all our lives
i beg you to remember this
not merely for my sake
but for yours
i happen
to occupy this big white house
i am a living witness that any one of your children may look to come here as my father's child has
it is in order that each one of you may have
through this free government which we have enjoyed
an open field
and a fair chance for your industry
and intelligence that you may all have equal privileges in the race of life with all its desirable human aspirations it is for this that the struggle should be maintained
that we may not lose our birthrights not only for one
but for two or three years
if necessary
the nation is worth fighting for
to secure such an inestimable jewel

my esteemed friend
i have not forgotten probably never shall forget the very impressive occasion when yourself and friends visited me on a sabbath forenoon two years ago nor has your kind letter
written nearly a year later
even been for gotten
in all
it has been your purpose to strengthen my reliance on god
i am much indebted to the good christian people of the country for their constant prayer and consolations and to no one of them
more than to yourself
the purposes of the almighty are perfect
and must prevail
though we erring mortals may fail to accurately perceive them in advance
we hoped for a happy termination of this terrible war long before this but god knows best
and has ruled otherwise
we shall yet acknowledge his wisdom
and our own error therein
mean while we must work earnestly in the best light he gives us
trusting that so working still conduces to the great ends he ordains
surely he intends some great good to follow this mighty convulsion
which no mortal could make
and no mortal could stay
your people the friends have had
and are having
a very great trial
on principle
and faith
opposed to both war and oppression
they can only practically oppose oppression by war
for those appealing to me on conscientious grounds
i have done
and shall do
the best i could and can
in my own conscience
under my oath to the law
that you believe this i doubt not
and believing it
i shall still receive
for our country and myself your earnest prayers to our father in heaven
your sincere friend

i can only say now
as i have often said before
it has always been a sentiment with me
that all mankind should be free

so far as came within my sphere
i have always acted as i believed was just and right
and done all i could for the good of mankind
i have
in letters sent forth from this office
expressed myself better than i can now
in regard to the great book
i have only to say it is the best gift which god has ever given to man
all the good from the saviour of the world is communicated to us through this book
but for that book
we could not know right from wrong
all those things desirable to man are contained in it
i return you sincere thanks for this very elegant copy of this great book of god which you present

major general sherman
the state election of indiana occurs on the 11th of october
and the loss of it to the friends of the government would go far towards losing the whole union cause
the bad effect upon the november election
and especially the giving the state government to those who will oppose the war in every possible way
are too much to risk if it can be avoided
the draft proceeds
notwithstanding its strong tendency to lose us the state
indiana is the only important state voting in october whose soldiers cannot vote in the field
anything you can safely do to let her soldiers or any part of them go home and vote at the state election will be greatly in point
they need not remain for the presidential election
but may return to you at once
this is in no sense an order
but is merely intended to impress you with the importance to the army itself of your doing all you safely can
yourself being the judge of what you can safely do

in my judgment
it could not be abandoned without greater evil than would follow its going through
i did not know at the time that you had protested against that class of thing being done and i now say that while this particular job must be completed
no other of the sort will be authorized
without an understanding with you

it was their good fortune to render efficient service in the brilliant operations in the southwest and to contribute to the victories of the national arms over the rebel forces in georgia under command of johnston and hood

i therefore send it to you with the statement that
as the numbers to be exchanged under it are small
and so much has already been done to effect the exchange
i hope you may find it consistent to let it go forward under the general supervision of general butler
and particularly in reference to the points he holds vital in exchanges
you are at liberty to arrest the whole operation if in your judgment the public good requires it

my dear sir
a convention of maryland has framed a new constitution for the state a public meeting is called for this evening at baltimore to aid in securing its ratification by the people
and you ask a word from me for the occasion
i presume the only feature of the instrument about which there is serious controversy is that which provides for the extinction of slavery
it needs not to be a secret and i presume it is no secret
that i wish success to this provision
i desire it on every consideration
i wish all men to be free
i wish the material prosperity of the already free
which i feel sure the extinction of slavery would bring
i wish to see in process of disappearing that only thing which ever could bring this nation to civil war
i attempt no argument
argument upon the question is already exhausted by the abler
better informed
and more immediately interested sons of maryland herself
i only add that i shall be gratified exceedingly if the good people of the state shall
by their votes
ratify the new constitution

october 19
friends and fellow citizens
i am notified that this is a compliment paid me by the loyal marylanders resident in this district
i infer that the adoption of the new constitution for the state furnishes the occasion
and that in your view the extirpation of slavery constitutes the chief merit of the new constitution
most heartily do i congratulate you
and maryland
and the nation
and the world
upon this event
i regret that it did not occur two years sooner
i am sure
would have saved the nation more money than would have met all the private loss incident to the measure but it has come at last
and i sincerely hope its friends may fully realize all their anticipations of good from it
and that its opponents may by its effects be agreeably and profitably disappointed
a word upon another subject
something said by the secretary of state in his recent speech at auburn
has been construed by some into a threat
that if i shall be beaten at the election
i will
between then and the end of my constitutional term
do what i may be able to ruin the government
others regard the fact that the chicago convention adjourned
not sine die
but to meet again
if called to do so by a particular individual
as the intimation of a purpose that if their nominee shall be elected he will at once seize control of the government
i hope the good people will permit themselves to suffer no uneasiness on either point
i am struggling to maintain the government
not to overthrow it
i am struggling especially to prevent others from overthrowing it
i therefore say
that if i live
i shall remain president until the 4th of next march
and that whoever shall be constitutionally elected
in november
shall be duly installed as president on the 4th of march
and in the interval i shall do my utmost that whoever is to hold the helm for the next voyage shall start with the best possible chance of saving the ship
this is due to the people
both on principle and under the constitution
their will
constitutionally expressed
is the ultimate law for all
if they should deliberately resolve to have immediate peace
even at the loss of their country and their liberties
i know not the power or the right to resist them
it is their own business
and they must do as they please with their own
i believe
they are still resolved to preserve their country and their liberties and in this
in office or out of it
i am resolved to stand by them
i may add
that in this purpose to save the country and its liberties
no classes of people seem so nearly unanimous as the soldiers in the field and the sailors afloat
do they not have the hardest of it
who should quail while they do not
god bless the soldiers and seamen
with all their brave commanders
proclamation of thanksgiving

a proclamation
it has pleased almighty god to prolong our national life another year
defending us with his guardian care against unfriendly designs from abroad
and vouchsafing to us in his mercy many and signal victories over the enemy
who is of our own household
it has also pleased our heavenly father to favor as well our citizens in their homes as our soldiers in their camps
and our sailors on the rivers and seas
with unusual health
he has largely augmented our free population by emancipation and by immigration
while he has opened to us new
sources of wealth
and has crowned the labor of our working men in every department of industry with abundant rewards
he has been pleased to animate and inspire our minds and hearts with fortitude
and resolution sufficient for the great trial of civil war into which we have been brought by our adherence as a nation to the cause of freedom and humanity
and to afford to us reasonable hopes of an ultimate and happy deliverance from all our dangers and afflictions
abraham lincoln
president of the united states
do hereby appoint and set apart the last thursday in november next as a day which i desire to be observed by all my fellow citizens
wherever they may be then
as a day of thanksgiving and praise to almighty god
the beneficent creator and ruler of the universe
and i do further recommend to my fellow citizens aforesaid
that on that occasion they do reverently humble themselves in the dust
and from thence offer up penitent and fervent prayers and supplications to the great disposer of events for a return of the inestimable blessings of peace
and harmony throughout the
land which it has pleased him to assign as a dwelling place for ourselves and for our posterity throughout all generations

on the 15th day of this month
as i remember
a printed paper manuscript
with a few manuscript interlineations
called a protest
with your names appended thereto
and accompanied by another printed paper
purporting to be a proclamation by andrew johnson
military governor of tennessee
and also a manuscript paper
purporting to be extracts from the code of tennessee
were laid before me
the protest
and extracts are respectively as follows
the protest is here recited
and also the proclamation of governor johnson
dated september 30
to which it refers
together with a list of the counties in east
and west tennessee also extracts from the code of tennessee in relation to electors of president and vice president
qualifications of voters for members of the general assembly
places of holding elections
and officers of popular elections
at the time these papers were presented
as before stated
i had never seen either of them
nor heard of the subject to which they related
except in a general way one day previously
up to the present moment
nothing whatever upon the subject has passed between governor johnson
or any one else
connected with the proclamation
and myself
since receiving the papers
as stated
i have given the subject such brief consideration as i have been able to do
in the midst of so many pressing public duties
my conclusion is
that i can have nothing to do with the matter
either to sustain the plan as the convention and governor johnson have initiated it
or to revoke or modify it as you demand
by the constitution and laws
the president is charged with no duty in the presidential election in any state
nor do i in this case perceive any military reason for his interference in the matter
the movement set on foot by the convention and governor johnson does not
as seems to be assumed by you
emanate from the national executive
in no proper sense can it be considered other than an independent movement of
at least
a portion of the loyal people of tennessee
i do not perceive in the plan any menace
or violence
or coercion towards any one
governor johnson
like any other loyal citizen of tennessee
has the right to favor any political plan he chooses
as military governor
it is his duty to keep peace among and for the loyal people of the state
i cannot discern that by this plan he purposes any more
but you object to the plan
leaving it alone will be your perfect security against it
it is not proposed to force you into it
do as you please
on your own account
peaceably and loyally
and governor johnson will not molest you
but will protect you against violence as far as in his power
i presume that the conducting of a presidential election in tennessee in strict accordance with the old code of the state
is not now a possibility
it is scarcely necessary to add
that if any election shall be held and any votes shall be cast in the state of tennessee for president and vice president of the united states
it will belong
not to the military agents
nor yet to the executive department
but exclusively to another department of the government
to determine whether they are entitled to be counted in conformity with the constitution and laws of the united states
except it be to give protection against violence
i decline to interfere in any way with any presidential election

november 9
friends and fellow citizens
even before i had been informed by you that this compliment was paid me by loyal citizens of pennsylvania
friendly to me
i had inferred that you were of that portion of my countrymen who think that the best interests of the nation are to be subserved by the support of the present administration
i do not pretend to say that you
who think so
embrace all the patriotism and loyalty of the country
but i do believe
and i trust without personal interest
that the welfare of the country does require that such support and indorsement should be given
i earnestly believe that the consequences of this day's work
if it be as you assume
and as now seems probable
will be to the lasting advantage
if not to the very salvation
of the country
i cannot at this hour say what has been the result of the election
whatever it may be
i have no desire to modify this opinion
that all who have labored to day in behalf of the union have wrought for the best interests of the country and the world not only for the present
but for all future ages
i am thankful to god for this approval of the people but
while deeply grateful for this mark of their confidence in me
if i know my heart
my gratitude is free from any taint of personal triumph
i do not impugn the motives of any one opposed to me
it is no pleasure to me to triumph over any one
but i give thanks to the almighty for this evidence of the people's resolution to stand by free government and the rights of humanity

the maryland soldiers in the army of the potomac cast a total vote of fourteen hundred and twenty eight
out of which we get eleven hundred and sixty majority
this is directly from general meade and general grant
on democratic government response to a serenade
november 10
it has long been a grave question whether any government
not too strong for the liberties of its people
can be strong enough to maintain its existence in great emergencies
on this point the present rebellion brought our government to a severe test
and a presidential election occurring in regular course during the rebellion
added not a little to the strain
if the loyal people united were put to the utmost of their strength by the rebellion
must they not fail when divided and partially paralyzed by a political war among themselves
but the election was a necessity
we cannot have free government without elections and if the election could force us to forego or postpone a national election
it might fairly claim to have already conquered and ruined us
the strife of the election is but human nature practically applied to the facts of the case
what has occurred in this case must ever recur in similar cases
human nature will not change
in any future great national trial
compared with the men of this
we will have as weak and as strong
as silly and as wise
as bad and as good
let us
study the incidents of this as philosophy to learn wisdom from
and none of them as wrongs to be revenged
but the election
along with its incidental and undesirable strife
has done good
it has demonstrated that a people's government can sustain a national election in the midst of a great civil war
until now
it has not been known to the world that this was a possibility
it shows
how sound and strong we still are
it shows that even among the candidates of the same party
he who is most devoted to the union and most opposed to treason can receive most of the people's votes
it shows
to the extent yet known
that we have more men now than we had when the war began
gold is good in its place but living
and patriotic men are better than gold
but the rebellion continues
now that the election is over
may not all have a common interest to reunite in a common effort to save our common country
for my own part
i have striven and shall strive to avoid placing any obstacle in the way
so long as i have been here
i have not willingly planted a thorn in any man's bosom
while i am duly sensible to the high compliment of a re election
and duly grateful
as i trust
to almighty god
for having directed my countrymen to a right conclusion
as i think
for their good
it adds nothing to my satisfaction that any other man may be disappointed by the result
may i ask those who have not differed with me to join with me in this same spirit towards those who have
and now
let me close by asking three hearty cheers for our brave soldiers and seamen
and their gallant and skillful commanders

major general hurlbut
few things since i have been here have impressed me more painfully than what
for four or five months past
has appeared a bitter military opposition to the new state government of louisiana
i still indulged some hope that i was mistaken in the fact but copies of a correspondence on the subject between general canby and yourself
and shown me to day
dispel that hope
a very fair proportion of the people of louisiana have inaugurated a new state government
making an excellent new constitution better for the poor black man than we have in illinois
this was done under military protection
directed by me
in the belief
still sincerely entertained
that with such a nucleus around which to build we could get the state into position again sooner than otherwise
in this belief a general promise of protection and support
applicable alike to louisiana and other states
was given in the last annual message
during the formation of the new government and constitution they were supported by nearly every loyal person
and opposed by every secessionist
and this support and this opposition
from the respective standpoints of the parties
was perfectly consistent and logical
every unionist ought to wish the new government to succeed and every disunionist must desire it to fail
its failure would gladden the heart of slidell in europe
and of every enemy of the old flag in the world
every advocate of slavery naturally desires to see blasted and crushed the liberty promised the black man by the new constitution
but why general canby and general hurlbut should join on the same side is to me incomprehensible
of course
in the condition of things at new orleans
the military must not be thwarted by the civil authority but when the constitutional convention
for what it deems a breach of privilege
arrests an editor in no way connected with the military
the military necessity for insulting the convention and forcibly discharging the editor is difficult to perceive
neither is the military necessity for protecting the people against paying large salaries fixed by a legislature of their own choosing very apparent
equally difficult to perceive is the military necessity for forcibly interposing to prevent a bank from loaning its own money to the state
these things
if they have occurred
at the best
no better than gratuitous hostility
i wish i could hope that they may be shown not to have occurred
to make assurance against misunderstanding
i repeat that in the existing condition of things in louisiana
the military must not be thwarted by the civil authority and i add that on points of difference the commanding general must be judge and master
but i also add that in the exercise of this judgment and control
a purpose
and scarcely unavowed
to transcend all military necessity
in order to crush out the civil government
will not be overlooked
yours truly
reply to maryland union committee
november 17
the president
in reply
said that he had to confess he had been duly notified of the intention to make this friendly call some days ago
and in this he had had a fair opportunity afforded to be ready with a set speech but he had not prepared one
being too busy for that purpose
he would say
that he was gratified with the result of the presidential election
he had kept as near as he could to the exercise of his best judgment for the interest of the whole country
and to have the seal of approbation stamped on the course he had pursued was exceedingly grateful to his feelings
he thought he could say
in as large a sense as any other man
that his pleasure consisted in belief that the policy he had pursued was the best
if not the only one
for the safety of the country
he had said before
and now repeated
that he indulged in no feeling of triumph over any man who thought or acted differently from himself
he had no such feeling toward any living man
when he thought of maryland
in particular
he was of the opinion that she had more than double her share in what had occurred in the recent elections
the adoption of a free state constitution was a greater thing than the part taken by the people of the state in the presidential election
he would any day have stipulated to lose maryland in the presidential election to save it by the adoption of a free state constitution
because the presidential election comes every four years
while that is a thing which
being done
cannot be undone
he therefore thought that in that they had a victory for the right worth a great deal more than their part in the presidential election
though of the latter he thought highly
he had once before said
but would say again
that those who have differed with us and opposed us will see that the result of the presidential election is better for their own good than if they had been successful
thanking the committee for their compliment
he brought his brief speech to a close
proclamation concerning blockade
november 19
1864 by the president of the united states of america
a proclamation
whereas by my proclamation of the 19th of april
it was declared that the ports of certain states
including those of norfolk
in the state of virginia
fernandina and pensacola
in the state of florida
for reasons therein set forth
intended to be placed under blockade and
whereas the said ports were subsequently blockaded accordingly
but having for some time past been in the military possession of the united states
it is deeemd advisable that they should be opened to domestic and foreign commerce
be it known that i
abraham lincoln
president of the united states
pursuant to the authority in me vested by the fifth section of the act of congress approved on the 13th of july
entitled an act further to provide for the collection of duties on imports
and for other purposes
do hereby declare that the blockade of the said ports of norfolk
and pensacola shall so far cease and determine
from and after the first day of december next
that commercial intercourse with those ports
except as to persons
and information contraband of war
from that time
be carried on
subject to the laws of the united states
to the limitations and in pursuance of the regulations which may be prescribed by the secretary of the treasury
and to such military and naval regulations as are now in force

two ladies from tennessee came before the president
asking the release of their husbands held as prisoners of war at johnson's island
they were put off until friday
when they came again
and were again put off until saturday
at each of the interviews one of the ladies urged that her husband was a religious man
and on saturday the president ordered the release of the prisoners
when he said to this lady
you say your husband is a religious man tell him when you meet him
that i say i am not much of a judge of religion
but that
in my opinion
the religion that sets men to rebel and fight against their own government
as they think
that government does not sufficiently help some men to eat their bread in the sweat of other men's faces
is not the sort of religion upon which people can get to heaven

a war steamer
called the funayma solace
having been built in this country
for the japanese government and at the instance of that government
it is deemed to comport with the public interest
in view of the unsettled condition of the relations of the united states with that empire
that the steamer should not be allowed to proceed to japan
the secretary of the navy should ascertain that the steamer is adapted to our service
he is authorized to purchase her
but the purchase money will be held in trust toward satisfying any valid claims which may be presented by the japanese on account of the construction of the steamer and the failure to deliver the same
as above set forth

upon recommendation by the president by name he receives the thanks of congress for highly distinguished conduct in conflict with the enemy

i most cordially recommend that lieutenant william b
united states navy
receive a vote of thanks from congress for his important
and perilous achievement in destroying the rebel ironclad steamer albemarle on the night of the 27th of october
at plymouth
the destruction of so formidable a vessel
which had resisted the continued attacks of a number of our vessels on former occasions
is an important event touching our future naval and military operations
and would reflect honor on any officer
and redounds to the credit of this young officer and the few brave comrades who assisted in this successful and daring undertaking
this recommendation is specially made in order to comply with the requirements of the ninth section of the aforesaid act
which is in the following words
that any line officer of the navy or marine corps may be advanced one grade if upon recommendation of the president by name he receives the thanks of congress for highly distinguished conduct in conflict with the enemy

annual message to congress

fellow citizens of the senate and house of representatives
again the blessings of health and abundant harvests claim our profoundest gratitude to almighty god
the condition of our foreign affairs is reasonably satisfactory
mexico continues to be a theater of civil war
while our political relations with that country have undergone no change
we have at the same time strictly maintained neutrality between the belligerents
at the request of the states of costa rica and nicaragua
a competent engineer has been authorized to make a survey of the river san juan and the port of san juan
it is a source of much satisfaction that the difficulties which for a moment excited some political apprehensions and caused a closing of the interoceanic transit route have been amicably adjusted
and that there is a good prospect that the route will soon be reopened with an increase of capacity and adaptation
we could not exaggerate either the commercial or the political importance of that great improvement
it would be doing injustice to an important south american state not to acknowledge the directness
and cordiality with which the united states of colombia have entered into intimate relations with this government
a claims convention has been constituted to complete the unfinished work of the one which closed its session in 1861
the new liberal constitution of venezuela having gone into effect with the universal acquiescence of the people
the government under it has been recognized and diplomatic intercourse with it has opened in a cordial and friendly spirit
the long deferred aves island claim has been satisfactorily paid and discharged
mutual payments have been made of the claims awarded by the late joint commission for the settlement of claims between the united states and peru
an earnest and cordial friendship continues to exist between the two countries
and such efforts as were in my power have been used to remove misunderstanding
and avert a threatened war between peru and spain
our relations are of the most friendly nature with chile
the argentine republic
costa rica
san salvador
and haiti
during the past year no differences of any kind have arisen with any of these republics
and on the other hand
their sympathies with the united states are constantly expressed with cordiality and earnestness
the claim arising from the seizure of the cargo of the brig macedonian in 1821 has been paid in full by the government of chile
civil war continues in the spanish part of san domingo
apparently without prospect of an early close
official correspondence has been freely opened with liberia
and it gives us a pleasing view of social and political progress in that republic
it may be expected to derive new vigor from american influence improved by the rapid disappearance of slavery in the united states
i solicit your authority to furnish to the republic a gunboat
at moderate cost
to be reimbursed to the united states by instalments
such a vessel is needed for the safety of that state against the native african races
and in liberian hands it would be more effective in arresting the african slave trade than a squadron in our own hands
the possession of the least organized naval force would stimulate a generous ambition in the republic
and the confidence which we should manifest by furnishing it would win forbearance and favor toward the colony from all civilized nations
the proposed overland telegraph between america and europe
by the way of bering straits and asiatic russia
which was sanctioned by congress at the last session
has been undertaken
under very favorable circumstances
by an association of american citizens
with the cordial good will and support as well of this government as of those of great britain and russia
assurances have been received from most of the south american states of their high appreciation of the enterprise and their readiness to co operate in constructing lines tributary to that world encircling communication
i learn with much satisfaction that the noble design of a telegraphic communication between the eastern coast of america and great britain has been renewed
with full expectation of its early accomplishment
thus it is hoped that with the return of domestic peace the country will be able to resume with energy and advantage its former high career of commerce and civilization
our very popular and estimable representative in egypt died in april last
an unpleasant altercation which arose between the temporary incumbent of the office and the government of the pasha resulted in a suspension of intercourse
the evil was promptly corrected on the arrival of the successor in the consulate
and our relations with egypt
as well as our relations with the barbary powers
are entirely satisfactory
the rebellion which has so long been flagrant in china has at last been suppressed
with the co operating good offices of this government and of the other western commercial states
the judicial consular establishment there has become very difficult and onerous
and it will need legislative revision to adapt it to the extension of our commerce and to the more intimate intercourse which has been instituted with the government and people of that vast empire
china seems to be accepting with hearty good will the conventional laws which regulate commercial and social intercourse among the western nations
owing to the peculiar situation of japan and the anomalous form of its government
the action of that empire in performing treaty stipulations is inconstant and capricious
good progress has been effected by the western powers
moving with enlightened concert
our own pecuniary claims have been allowed or put in course of settlement
and the inland sea has been reopened to commerce
there is reason also to believe that these proceedings have increased rather than diminished the friendship of japan toward the united states
the ports of norfolk
and pensacola have been opened by proclamation
it is hoped that foreign merchants will now consider whether it is not safer and more profitable to themselves
as well as just to the united states
to resort to these and other open ports than it is to pursue
through many hazards and at vast cost
a contraband trade with other ports which are closed
if not by actual military occupation
at least by a lawful and effective blockade
for myself
i have no doubt of the power and duty of the executive
under the law of nations
to exclude enemies of the human race from an asylum in the united states
if congress should think that proceedings in such cases lack the authority of law
or ought to be further regulated by it
i recommend that provision be made for effectually preventing foreign slave traders from acquiring domicile and facilities for their criminal occupation in our country
it is possible that if it were a new and open question the maritime powers
with the lights they now enjoy
would not concede the privileges of a naval belligerent to the insurgents of the united states
as they are
and always have been
equally of ships of war and of ports and harbors
disloyal emissaries have been neither assiduous nor more successful during the last year than they were before that time in their efforts
under favor of that privilege
to embroil our country in foreign wars
the desire and determination of the governments of the maritime states to defeat that design are believed to be as sincere as and can not be more earnest than our own
unforeseen political difficulties have arisen
especially in brazilian and british ports and on the northern boundary of the united states
which have required
and are likely to continue to require
the practice of constant vigilance and a just and conciliatory spirit on the part of the united states
as well as of the nations concerned and their governments
commissioners have been appointed under the treaty with great britain on the adjustment of the claims of the hudson bay and puget sound agricultural companies
in oregon
and are now proceeding to the execution of the trust assigned to them
in view of the insecurity of life and property in the region adjacent to the canadian border
by reason of recent assaults and depredations committed by inimical and desperate persons who are harbored there
it has been thought proper to give notice that after the expiration of six months
the period conditionally stipulated in the existing arrangement with great britain
the united states must hold themselves at liberty to increase their naval armament upon the lakes if they shall find that proceeding necessary
the condition of the border will necessarily come into consideration in connection with the question of continuing or modifying the rights of transit from canada through the united states
as well as the regulation of imposts
which were temporarily established by the reciprocity treaty of the 5th june
i desire
to be understood while making this statement that the colonial authorities of canada are not deemed to be intentionally unjust or unfriendly toward the united states
on the contrary
there is every reason to expect that
with the approval of the imperial government
they will take the necessary measures to prevent new incursions across the border
the act passed at the last session for the encouragement of immigration has so far as was possible been put into operation
it seems to need amendment which will enable the officers of the government to prevent the practice of frauds against the immigrants while on their way and on their arrival in the ports
so as to secure them here a free choice of avocations and places of settlement
a liberal disposition toward this great national policy is manifested by most of the european states
and ought to be reciprocated on our part by giving the immigrants effective national protection
i regard our immigrants as one of the principal replenishing streams which are appointed by providence to repair the ravages of internal war and its wastes of national strength and health
all that is necessary is to secure the flow of that stream in its present fullness
and to that end the government must in every way make it manifest that it neither needs nor designs to impose involuntary military service upon those who come from other lands to cast their lot in our country
the financial affairs of the government have been successfully administered during the last year
the legislation of the last session of congress has beneficially affected the revenues
although sufficient time has not yet elapsed to experience the full effect of several of the provisions of the acts of congress imposing increased taxation
the receipts during the year from all sources
upon the basis of warrants signed by the secretary of the treasury
including loans and the balance in the treasury on the 1st day of july
were 1
and the aggregate disbursements
upon the same basis
were 1
leaving a balance in the treasury
as shown by warrants
of 96
deduct from these amounts the amount of the principal of the public debt redeemed and the amount of issues in substitution therefor
and the actual cash operations of the treasury were
57 disbursements
86 which leaves a cash balance in the treasury of 18
of the receipts there were derived from customs 102
from lands 588
from direct taxes 475
from internal revenue 109
from miscellaneous sources 47
and from loans applied to actual expenditures
including former balance
there were disbursed for the civil service 27
for pensions and indians 7
for the war department 690
for the navy department 85
for interest on the public debt 53
making an aggregate of 865
and leaving a balance in the treasury of 18
as before stated
for the actual receipts and disbursements for the first quarter and the estimated receipts and disbursements for the three remaining quarters of the current fiscal year
and the general operations of the treasury in detail
i refer you to the report of the secretary of the treasury
i concur with him in the opinion that the proportion of moneys required to meet the expenses consequent upon the war derived from taxation should be still further increased and i earnestly invite your attention to this subject to the end that there be such additional legislation as shall be required to meet the just expectations of the secretary
the public debt on the first day of july last
as appears by the books of the treasury
amounted to 1
should the war continue for another year
that amount may be increased by not far from 500
as it is
for the most part by our own people
it has become a substantial branch of national
though private
for obvious reasons the more nearly this property can be distributed among all the people the better
to favor such general distribution
greater inducements to become owners might
with good effect and without injury be presented to persons of limited means
with this view i suggest whether it might not be both competent and expedient for congress to provide that a limited amount of some future issue of public securities might be held by any bona fide purchaser exempt from taxation and from seizure for debt
under such restrictions and limitations as might be necessary to guard against abuse of so important a privilege
this would enable every prudent person to set aside a small annuity against a possible day of want
privileges like these would render the possession of such securities to the amount limited most desirable to every person of small means who might be able to save enough for the purpose
the great advantage of citizens being creditors as well as debtors with relation to the public debt is obvious
men readily perceive that they can not be much oppressed by a debt which they owe to themselves
the public debt on the first day of july last
although somewhat exceeding the estimate of the secretary of the treasury made to congress at the commencement of the last session
falls short of the estimate of that officer made in the preceding december as to its probable amount at the beginning of this year by the sum of 3
this fact exhibits a satisfactory condition and conduct of the operations of the treasury
the national banking system is proving to be acceptable to capitalists and to the people
on the twenty fifth day of november five hundred and eighty four national banks had been organized
a considerable number of which were conversions from state banks
changes from state systems to the national system are rapidly taking place
and it is hoped that very soon there will be in the united states no banks of issue not authorized by congress and no bank note circulation not secured by the government
that the government and the people will derive great benefit from this change in the banking systems of the country can hardly be questioned
the national system will create a reliable and permanent influence in support of the national credit and protect the people against losses in the use of paper money
whether or not any further legislation is advisable for the suppression of state bank issues
it will be for congress to determine
it seems quite clear that the treasury can not be satisfactorily conducted unless the government can exercise a restraining power over the bank note circulation of the country
the report of the secretary of war and the accompanying documents will detail the campaigns of the armies in the field since the date of the last annual message
and also the operations of the several administrative bureaus of the war department during the last year
it will also specify the measures deemed essential for the national defense and to keep up and supply the requisite military force
the report of the secretary of the navy presents a comprehensive and satisfactory exhibit of the affairs of that department and of the naval service
it is a subject of congratulation and laudable pride to our countrymen that a navy of such vast proportions has been organized in so brief a period and conducted with so much efficiency and success
the general exhibit of the navy
including vessels under construction on the first of december
shows a total of 671 vessels
carrying 4610 guns
and of 510
396 tons
being an actual increase during the year
over and above all losses by shipwreck or in battle
of 83 vessels
167 guns
and 42
427 tons
the total number of men at this time in the naval service
including officers
is about 51
there have been captured by the navy during the year 324 vessels
and the whole number of naval captures since hostilities commenced is 1379
of which 267 are steamers
the gross proceeds arising from the sale of condemned prize property thus far reported amount to 14
a large amount of such proceeds is still under adjudication and yet to be reported
the total expenditure of the navy department of every description
including the cost of the immense squadrons that have been called into existence from the fourth of march
to the first of november
is 238
your favorable consideration is invited to the various recommendations of the secretary of the navy
especially in regard to a navy yard and suitable establishment for the construction and repair of iron vessels and the machinery and armature for our ships
to which reference was made in my last annual message
your attention is also invited to the views expressed in the report in relation to the legislation of congress at its last session in respect to prize on our inland waters
i cordially concur in the recommendation of the secretary as to the propriety of creating the new rank of vice admiral in our naval service
your attention is invited to the report of the postmaster general for a detailed account of the operations and financial condition of the post office department
the postal revenues for the year ending june 30
amounted to 12
and the expenditures to 12
the excess of expenditures over receipts being 206
the views presented by the postmaster general on the subject of special grants by the government in aid of the establishment of new lines of ocean mail steamships and the policy he recommends for the development of increased commercial intercourse with adjacent and neighboring countries should receive the careful consideration of congress
it is of noteworthy interest that the steady expansion of population
and governmental institutions over the new and unoccupied portions of our country have scarcely been checked
much less impeded or destroyed
by our great civil war
which at first glance would seem to have absorbed almost the entire energies of the nation
the organization and admission of the state of nevada has been completed in conformity with law
and thus our excellent system is firmly established in the mountains
which once seemed a barren and uninhabitable waste between the atlantic states and those which have grown up on the coast of the pacific ocean
the territories of the union are generally in a condition of prosperity and rapid growth
idaho and montana
by reason of their great distance and the interruption of communication with them by indian hostilities
have been only partially organized but it is understood that these difficulties are about to disappear
which will permit their governments
like those of the others
to go into speedy and full operation
as intimately connected with and promotive of this material growth of the nation
i ask the attention of congress to the valuable information and important recommendations relating to the public lands
indian affairs
the pacific railroad
and mineral discoveries contained in the report of the secretary of the interior which is herewith transmitted
and which report also embraces the subjects of patents
and other topics of public interest pertaining to his department
the quantity of public land disposed of during the five quarters ending on the thirtieth of september last was 4
342 acres
of which 1
614 acres were entered under the homestead law
the remainder was located with military land warrants
agricultural scrip certified to states for railroads
and sold for cash
the cash received from sales and location fees was 1
the income from sales during the fiscal year ending june 30
was 678
against 136
95 received during the preceding year
the aggregate number of acres surveyed during the year has been equal to the quantity disposed of
and there is open to settlement about 133
000 acres of surveyed land
the great enterprise of connecting the atlantic with the pacific states by railways and telegraph lines has been entered upon with a vigor that gives assurance of success
notwithstanding the embarrassments arising from the prevailing high prices of materials and labor
the route of the main line of the road has been definitely located for one hundred miles westward from the initial point at omaha city
and a preliminary location of the pacific railroad of california has been made from sacramento eastward to the great bend of the truckee river in nevada
numerous discoveries of gold
and cinnabar mines have been added to the many heretofore known
and the country occupied by the sierra nevada and rocky mountains and the subordinate ranges now teems with enterprising labor
which is richly remunerative
it is believed that the produce of the mines of precious metals in that region has during the year reached
if not exceeded
000 in value
it was recommended in my last annual message that our indian system be remodeled
congress at its last session
acting upon the recommendation
did provide for reorganizing the system in california
and it is believed that under the present organization the management of the indians there will be attended with reasonable success
much yet remains to be done to provide for the proper government of the indians in other parts of the country
to render it secure for the advancing settler
and to provide for the welfare of the indian
the secretary reiterates his recommendations
and to them the attention of congress is invited
the liberal provisions made by congress for paying pensions to invalid soldiers and sailors of the republic and to the widows
and dependent mothers of those who have fallen in battle or died of disease contracted or of wounds received in the service of their country have been diligently administered
there have been added to the pension rolls during the year ending the 30th day of june last the names of 16
770 invalid soldiers and of 271 disabled seamen
making the present number of army invalid pensioners 22
767 and of navy invalid pensioners 712
of widows
and mothers 22
198 have been placed on the army pension rolls and 248 on the navy rolls
the present number of army pensioners of this class is 25
433 and of navy pensioners 793
at the beginning of the year the number of revolutionary pensioners was 1430
only twelve of them were soldiers
of whom seven have since died
the remainder are those who under the law receive pensions because of relationship to revolutionary soldiers
during the year ending the thirtieth of june
92 have been paid to pensioners of all classes
i cheerfully commend to your continued patronage the benevolent institutions of the district of columbia which have hitherto been established or fostered by congress
and respectfully refer for information concerning them and in relation to the washington aqueduct
the capitol
and other matters of local interest to the report of the secretary
the agricultural department
under the supervision of its present energetic and faithful head
is rapidly commending itself to the great and vital interest it was created to advance
it is peculiarly the people's department
in which they feel more directly concerned than in any other
i commend it to the continued attention and fostering care of congress
the war continues
since the last annual message all the important lines and positions then occupied by our forces have been maintained and our arms have steadily advanced
thus liberating the regions left in rear
so that missouri
and parts of other states have again produced reasonably fair crops
the most remarkable feature in the military operations of the year is general sherman's attempted march of three hundred miles directly through the insurgent region
it tends to show a great increase of our relative strength that our general in chief should feel able to confront and hold in check every active force of the enemy
and yet to detach a well appointed large army to move on such an expedition
the result not yet being known
conjecture in regard to it is not here indulged
important movements have also occurred during the year to the effect of molding society for durability in the union
although short of complete success
it is much in the right direction that twelve thousand citizens in each of the states of arkansas and louisiana have organized loyal state governments
with free constitutions
and are earnestly struggling to maintain and administer them
the movements in the same direction more extensive though less definite in missouri
and tennessee
should not be overlooked
but maryland presents the example of complete success
maryland is secure to liberty and union for all the future
the genius of rebellion will no more claim maryland
like another foul spirit being driven out
it may seek to tear her
but it will woo her no more
at the last session of congress a proposed amendment of the constitution abolishing slavery throughout the united states passed the senate
but failed for lack of the requisite two thirds vote in the house of representatives
although the present is the same congress and nearly the same members
and without questioning the wisdom or patriotism of those who stood in opposition
i venture to recommend the reconsideration and passage of the measure at the present session
of course the abstract question is not changed but an intervening election shows almost certainly that the next congress will pass the measure if this does not
hence there is only a question of time as to when the proposed amendment will go to the states for their action
and as it is to so go at all events
may we not agree that the sooner the better
it is not claimed that the election has imposed a duty on members to change their views or their votes any further than
as an additional element to be considered
their judgment may be affected by it
it is the voice of the people now for the first time heard upon the question
in a great national crisis like ours
unanimity of action among those seeking a common end is very desirable
almost indispensable
and yet no approach to such unanimity is attainable unless some deference shall be paid to the will of the majority simply because it is the will of the majority
in this case the common end is the maintenance of the union
and among the means to secure that end such will
through the election
is most clearly declared in favor of such constitutional amendment
the most reliable indication of public purpose in this country is derived through our popular elections
judging by the recent canvass and its result
the purpose of the people within the loyal states to maintain the integrity of the union was never more firm nor more nearly unanimous than now
the extraordinary calmness and good order with which the millions of voters met and mingled at the polls give strong assurance of this
not only all those who supported the union ticket
so called
but a great majority of the opposing party also may be fairly claimed to entertain and to be actuated by the same purpose
it is an unanswerable argument to this effect that no candidate for any office whatever
high or low
has ventured to seek votes on the avowal that he was for giving up the union
there have been much impugning of motives and much heated controversy as to the proper means and best mode of advancing the union cause
but on the distinct issue of union or no union the politicians have shown their instinctive knowledge that there is no diversity among the people
in affording the people the fair opportunity of showing one to another and to the world this firmness and unanimity of purpose
the election has been of vast value to the national cause
the election has exhibited another fact not less valuable to be known the fact that we do not approach exhaustion in the most important branch of national resources
that of living men
while it is melancholy to reflect that the war has filled so many graves and carried mourning to so many hearts
it is some relief to know that
compared with the surviving
the fallen have been so few
while corps and divisions and brigades and regiments have formed and fought and dwindled and gone out of existence
a great majority of the men who composed them are still living
the same is true of the naval service
the election returns prove this
so many voters could not else be found
the states regularly holding elections
both now and four years ago
to wit
new hampshire
new jersey
new york
rhode island
west virginia
and wisconsin
cast 3
011 votes now
against 3
222 cast then
showing an aggregate now of 3
to this is to be added 33
762 cast now in the new states of kansas and nevada
which states did not vote in 1860
thus swelling the aggregate to 4
773 and the net increase during the three years and a half of war to 145
a table is appended showing particulars
to this again should be added the number of all soldiers in the field from massachusetts
rhode island
new jersey
and california
who by the laws of those states could not vote away from their homes
and which number can not be less than 90
nor yet is this all
the number in organized territories is triple now what it was four years ago while thousands
white and black
join us as the national arms press back the insurgent lines
so much is shown
affirmatively and negatively
by the election
it is not material to inquire how the increase has been produced or to show that it would have been greater but for the war
which is probably true
the important fact remains demonstrated that we have more men now than we had when the war began that we are not exhausted nor in process of exhaustion that we are gaining strength and may if need be maintain the contest indefinitely
this sentence recognizes the concern of a guerilla war after the main war finished
this as to men
material resources are now more complete and abundant than ever
the national resources
are unexhausted
as we believe
the public purpose to re establish and maintain the national authority is unchanged
as we believe
the manner of continuing the effort remains to choose
on careful consideration of all the evidence accessible it seems to me that no attempt at negotiation with the insurgent leader could result in any good
he would accept nothing short of severance of the union
precisely what we will not and can not give
his declarations to this effect are explicit and oft repeated
he does not attempt to deceive us
he affords us no excuse to deceive ourselves
he can not voluntarily reaccept the union we can not voluntarily yield it
between him and us the issue is distinct
and inflexible
it is an issue which can only be tried by war and decided by victory
if we yield
we are beaten if the southern people fail him
he is beaten
either way it would be the victory and defeat following war
what is true
of him who heads the insurgent cause is not necessarily true of those who follow
although he can not reaccept the union
they can
some of them
we know
already desire peace and reunion
the number of such may increase
they can at any moment have peace simply by laying down their arms and submitting to the national authority under the constitution
after so much the government could not
if it would
maintain war against them
the loyal people would not sustain or allow it
if questions should remain
we would adjust them by the peaceful means of legislation
and votes
operating only in constitutional and lawful channels
some certain
and other possible
questions are and would be beyond the executive power to adjust as
for instance
the admission of members into congress and whatever might require the appropriation of money
the executive power itself would be greatly diminished by the cessation of actual war
pardons and remissions of forfeitures
would still be within executive control
in what spirit and temper this control would be exercised can be fairly judged of by the past
a year ago general pardon and amnesty
upon specified terms
were offered to all except certain designated classes
and it was at the same time made known that the excepted classes were still within contemplation of special clemency
during the year many availed themselves of the general provision
and many more would
only that the signs of bad faith in some led to such precautionary measures as rendered the practical process less easy and certain
during the same time also special pardons have been granted to individuals of the excepted classes
and no voluntary application has been denied
thus practically the door has been for a full year open to all except such as were not in condition to make free choice that is
such as were in custody or under constraint
it is still so open to all
but the time may come
probably will come
when public duty shall demand that it be closed and that in lieu more rigorous measures than heretofore shall be adopted
in presenting the abandonment of armed resistance to the national authority on the part of the insurgents as the only indispensable condition to ending the war on the part of the government
i retract nothing heretofore said as to slavery
i repeat the declaration made a year ago
that while i remain in my present position i shall not attempt to retract or modify the emancipation proclamation
nor shall i return to slavery any person who is free by the terms of that proclamation or by any of the acts of congress
if the people should
by whatever mode or means
make it an executive duty to re enslave such persons
and not i
must be their instrument to perform it
in stating a single condition of peace i mean simply to say that the war will cease on the part of the government whenever it shall have ceased on the part of those who began it

if not fearful but feeling that you were the better judge
and remembering that nothing risked
nothing gained
i did not interfere
the undertaking being a success
the honor is all yours for i believe none of us went further than to acquiesce
and taking the work of general thomas into the count
as it should be taken
it is indeed a great success
not only does it afford the obvious and immediate military advantages but in showing to the world that your army could be divided
putting the stronger part to an important new service
and yet leaving enough to vanquish the old opposing force of the whole
hood's army
it brings those who sat in darkness to see a great light
but what next
i suppose it will be safe if i leave general grant and yourself to decide
please make my grateful acknowledgments to your whole army of officers and men

to the house of representatives of the united states
i herewith return to your honorable body
in which it originated
a joint resolution to correct certain clerical errors in the internal revenue act
without my approval
my reason for so doing is that i am informed that this joint resolution was prepared during the last moments of the last session of congress for the purpose of correcting certain errors of reference in the internal revenue act
which were discovered on an examination of an official copy procured from the state department a few hours only before the adjournment
it passed the house and went to the senate
where a vote was taken upon it
but by some accident it was not presented to the president of the senate for his signature
since the adjournment of the last session of congress
other errors of a kind similar to those which this resolution was designed to correct
have been discovered in the law
and it is now thought most expedient to include all the necessary corrections in one act or resolution

please gather information

and banning only him who refuses to let others alone may not enable you to withdraw the troops

nor yet to give him a commission

you will make known to them that three things are indispensable to wit
the restoration of the national authority throughout all the states
no receding by the executive of the united states on the slavery question from the position assumed thereon in the late annual message to congress
and in preceding documents
no cessation of hostilities short of an end of the war and the disbanding of all forces hostile to the government
you will inform them that all propositions of theirs
not inconsistent with the above
will be considered and passed upon in a spirit of sincere liberality
you will hear all they may choose to say and report it to me
you will not assume to definitely consummate anything
constitutional amendment for the abolishing of slavery passage through congress of the constitutional amendment for the abolishing of slavery response to a serenade
january 31
he supposed the passage through congress of the constitutional amendment for the abolishing of slavery throughout the united states was the occasion to which he was indebted for the honor of this call
the occasion was one of congratulation to the country
and to the whole world
but there is a task yet before us to go forward and consummate by the votes of the states that which congress so nobly began yesterday
he had the honor to inform those present that illinois had already done the work
maryland was about half through
but he felt proud that illinois was a little ahead
he thought this measure was a very fitting if not an indispensable adjunct to the winding up of the great difficulty
he wished the reunion of all the states perfected
and so effected as to remove all causes of disturbance in the future and
to attain this end
it was necessary that the original disturbing cause should
if possible
be rooted out
he thought all would bear him witness that he had never shirked from doing all that he could to eradicate slavery
by issuing an emancipation proclamation
but that proclamation falls short of what the amendment will be when fully consummated
a question might be raised whether the proclamation was legally valid
it might be added
that it only aided those who came into our lines
and that it was inoperative as to those who did not give themselves up or that it would have no effect upon the children of the slaves born hereafter in fact
it would be urged that it did not meet the evil
but this amendment is a king's cure for all evils
it winds the whole thing up
he would repeat
that it was the fitting if not the indispensable adjunct to the consummation of the great game we are playing
he could not but congratulate all present himself
the country
and the whole world upon this great moral victory

order to make corrections in the draft
executive mansion
washington city
february 6
1865 whereas complaints are made in some localities respecting the assignments of quotas and credits allowed for the pending call of troops to fill up the armies
in order to determine all controversies in respect thereto
and to avoid any delay in filling up the armies
it is ordered
that the attorney general
brigadier general richard delafield
and colonel c
and they are hereby constituted
a board to examine into the proper quotas and credits of the respective states and districts under the call of december 19
with directions
if any errors be found therein
to make such corrections as the law and facts may require
and report their determination to the provost marshal general
the determination of said board to be final and conclusive
and the draft to be made in conformity therewith
the provost marshal general is ordered to make the draft in the respective districts as speedily as the same can be done after the fifteenth of this month
to provost marshal general
executive mansion
february 6
these gentlemen distinctly say to me this morning that what they want is the means from your office of showing their people that the quota assigned to them is right
they think it will take but little time two hours
they say
please give there double the time and every facility you can
yours truly

the provost marshal brings this letter back to me and says he cannot give the facility required without detriment to the service
and thereupon he is excused from doing it

complaint is made to me that you are forcing negroes into the military service
and even torturing them riding them on rails and the like to extort their consent
i hope this may be a mistake
the like must not be done by you
or any one under you
you must not force negroes any more than white men
answer me on this
to governor smith
executive mansion
february 8
his excellency governor smith
of vermont
complaint is made to me
by vermont
that the assignment of her quota for the draft on the pending call is intrinsically unjust
and also in bad faith of the government's promise to fairly allow credits for men previously furnished
to illustrate
a supposed case is stated as follows
vermont and new hampshire must between them furnish six thousand men on the pending call and being equal
each must furnish as many as the other in the long run
but the government finds that on former calls vermont furnished a surplus of five hundred
and new hampshire a surplus
of fifteen hundred
these two surpluses making two thousand and added to the six thousand
making eight thousand to be furnished by the two states
or four thousand each less
by fair credits
then subtract vermont's surplus of five hundred from her four thousand
leaves three thousand five hundred as her quota on the pending call and likewise subtract new hampshire's surplus of fifteen hundred from her four thousand
leaves two thousand five hundred as her quota on the pending call
these three thousand five hundred and two thousand five hundred make precisely six thousand
which the supposed case requires from the two states
and it is just equal for vermont to furnish one thousand more now than new hampshire
because new hampshire has heretofore furnished one thousand more than vermont
which equalizes the burdens of the two in the long run
and this result
so far from being bad faith to vermont
is indispensable to keeping good faith with new hampshire
by no other result can the six thousand men be obtained from the two states
at the same time deal justly and keep faith with both
and we do but confuse ourselves in questioning the process by which the right result is reached
the supposed case is perfect as an illustration
the pending call is not for three hundred thousand men subject to fair credits
but is for three hundred thousand remaining after all fair credits have been deducted
and it is impossible to concede what vermont asks without coming out short of three hundred thousand men
or making other localities pay for the partiality shown her
this upon the case stated
if there be different reasons for making an allowance to vermont
let them be presented and considered
yours truly

to the honorable the senate and house of representatives
the joint resolution entitled joint resolution declaring certain states not entitled to representation in the electoral college has been signed by the executive in deference to the view of congress implied in its passage and presentation to him
in his own view
the two houses of congress
convened under the twelfth article of the constitution
have complete power to exclude from counting all electoral votes deemed by them to be illegal
and it is not competent for the executive to defeat or obstruct that power by a veto
as would be the case if his action were at all essential in the matter
he disclaims all right of the executive to interfere in any way in the matter of canvassing or counting electoral votes
and he also disclaims that by signing said resolution he has expressed any opinion on the recitals of the preamble or any judgment of his own upon the subject of the resolution

to enter into negotiations for the restoration of peace
and am ready to send a commission whenever i have reason to suppose it will be received

that notwithstanding the rejection of our former offers
i would
if you could promise that a commissioner
or other agent would be received
appoint one immediately

afterwards mr

which entry is as follows
january 28
1865 to day mr
blair tells me that on the twenty first instant he delivered to mr
davis the original of which the within is a copy
and left it with him that at the time of delivering it mr
davis read it over twice in mr
blair's presence
at the close of which he mr
blair remarked that the part about our one common country related to the part of mr

that i am convinced upon conversation with messrs
stephens and hunter that their intentions are good and their desire sincere to restore peace and union
i have not felt myself at liberty to express even views of my own or to account for my reticency
this has placed me in an awkward position
which i could have avoided by not seeing them in the first instance
i fear now their going back without any expression from anyone in authority will have a bad influence
at the same time
i recognize the difficulties in the way of receiving these informal commissioners at this time
and do not know what to recommend
i am sorry
that mr

thomas t
major and aid de camp
in reply to your verbal statement that your instructions did not allow you to alter the conditions upon which a passport could be given to us
we say that we are willing to proceed to fortress monroe and there to have an informal conference with any person or persons that president lincoln may appoint on the basis of his letter to francis p
blair of the 18th of january ultimo
or upon any other terms or conditions that he may hereafter propose not inconsistent with the essential principles of self government and popular rights
upon which our institutions are founded
it is our earnest wish to ascertain
after a free interchange of ideas and information
upon what principles and terms
if any
a just and honorable peace can be established without the further effusion of blood
and to contribute our utmost efforts to accomplish such a result
we think it better to add that in accepting your passport we are not to be understood as committing ourselves to anything but to carry to this informal conference the views and feelings above expressed
very respectfully

the above communication was delivered to me at fort monroe at 4

eckert major and aid de camp
on the morning of the third the three gentlemen
and campbell
came aboard of our steamer and had an interview with the secretary of state and myself of several hours' duration
no question of preliminaries to the meeting was then and there made or mentioned no other person was present no papers were exchanged or produced and it was in advance agreed that the conversation was to be informal and verbal merely
on our part the whole substance of the instructions to the secretary of state hereinbefore recited was stated and insisted upon
and nothing was said inconsistent therewith while by the other party it was not said that in any event or on any condition they ever would consent to reunion
and yet they equally omitted to declare that they never would consent
they seemed to desire a postponement of that question and the adoption of some other course first
as some of them seemed to argue
might or might not lead to reunion
but which course we thought would amount to an indefinite postponement
the conference ended without result
the foregoing
as is believed
all the information sought is respectfully submitted

requesting the president of the united states

not incompatible with the public interests
to furnish to the senate any information in his possession concerning recent conversations or communications with certain rebels
said to have taken place under executive sanction
including communications with the rebel jefferson davis
and any correspondence relating thereto

and transmitted to the house this day
appended to this report is a copy of an instruction which has been addressed to charles francis adams
envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary of the united states at london
and which is the only correspondence found in this department touching the subject referred to in the resolution

february 7
1865 on the morning of the 3d
the president
attended by the secretary
received messrs
and campbell on board the united states steam transport river queen in hampton roads
the conference was altogether informal
there was no attendance of secretaries
or other witnesses
nothing was written or read
the conversation
although earnest and free
was calm
and courteous
and kind on both sides
the richmond party approached the discussion rather indirectly
and at no time did they either make categorical demands
or tender formal stipulations or absolute refusals
during the conference
which lasted four hours
the several points at issue between the government and the insurgents were distinctly raised
and discussed fully
and in an amicable spirit
what the insurgent party seemed chiefly to favor was a postponement of the question of separation
upon which the war is waged
and a mutual direction of efforts of the government
as well as those of the insurgents
to some extrinsic policy or scheme for a season during which passions might be expected to subside
and the armies be reduced
and trade and intercourse between the people of both sections resumed
it was suggested by them that through such postponement we might now have immediate peace
with some not very certain prospect of an ultimate satisfactory adjustment of political relations between this government and the states
or people now engaged in conflict with it
this suggestion
though deliberately considered
was nevertheless regarded by the president as one of armistice or truce
and he announced that we can agree to no cessation or suspension of hostilities
except on the basis of the disbandment of the insurgent forces
and the restoration of the national authority throughout all the states in the union
and in subordination to the proposition which was thus announced
the antislavery policy of the united states was reviewed in all its bearings
and the president announced that he must not be expected to depart from the positions he had heretofore assumed in his proclamation of emancipation and other documents
as these positions were reiterated in his last annual message
it was further declared by the president that the complete restoration of the national authority was an indispensable condition of any assent on our part to whatever form of peace might be proposed
the president assured the other party that
while he must adhere to these positions
he would be prepared
so far as power is lodged with the executive
to exercise liberality
his power
is limited by the constitution and when peace should be made
congress must necessarily act in regard to appropriations of money and to the admission of representatives from the insurrectionary states
the richmond party were then informed that congress had
on the 31st ultimo
adopted by a constitutional majority a joint resolution submitting to the several states the proposition to abolish slavery throughout the union
and that there is every reason to expect that it will be soon accepted by three fourths of the states
so as to become a part of the national organic law
the conference came to an end by mutual acquiescence
without producing an agreement of views upon the several matters discussed
or any of them
it is perhaps of some importance that we have been able to submit our opinions and views directly to prominent insurgents
and to hear them in answer in a courteous and not unfriendly manner
i am
your obedient servant

second inaugural address
march 4
at this second appearing to take the oath of the presidential office there is less occasion for an extended address than there was at the first
then a statement somewhat in detail of a course to be pursued seemed fitting and proper
at the expiration of four years
during which public declarations have been constantly called forth on every point and phase of the great contest which still absorbs the attention and engrosses the energies of the nation
little that is new could be presented
the progress of our arms
upon which all else chiefly depends
is as well known to the public as to myself
and it is
i trust
reasonably satisfactory and encouraging to all
with high hope for the future
no prediction in regard to it is ventured
on the occasion corresponding to this four years ago all thoughts were anxiously directed to an impending civil war
all dreaded it
all sought to avert it
while the inaugural address was being delivered from this place
devoted altogether to saving the union without war
insurgent agents were in the city seeking to destroy it without war seeking to dissolve the union and divide effects by negotiation
both parties deprecated war
but one of them would make war rather than let the nation survive
and the other would accept war rather than let it perish
and the war came
one eighth of the whole population was colored slaves
not distributed generally over the union
but localized in the southern part of it
these slaves constituted a peculiar and powerful interest
all knew that this interest was somehow the cause of the war
to strengthen
and extend this interest was the object for which the insurgents would rend the union even by war
while the government claimed no right to do more than to restrict the territorial enlargement of it
neither party expected for the war the magnitude or the duration which it has already attained
neither anticipated that the cause of the conflict might cease with or even before the conflict itself should cease
each looked for an easier triumph
and a result less fundamental and astounding
both read the same bible and pray to the same god
and each invokes his aid against the other
it may seem strange that any men should dare to ask a just god's assistance in wringing their bread from the sweat of other men's faces
but let us judge not
that we be not judged
the prayers of both could not be answered
that of neither has been answered fully
the almighty has his own purposes
woe unto the world because of offenses for it must needs be that offenses come
but woe to that man by whom the offense cometh
if we shall suppose that american slavery is one of those offenses which
in the providence of god
must needs come
but which
having continued through his appointed time
he now wills to remove
and that he gives to both north and south this terrible war as the woe due to those by whom the offense came
shall we discern therein any departure from those divine attributes which the believers in a living god always ascribe to him
fondly do we hope
fervently do we pray
that this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away
if god wills that it continue until all the wealth piled by the bondsman's two hundred and fifty years of unrequited toil shall be sunk
and until every drop of blood drawn with the lash shall be paid by another drawn with the sword
as was said three thousand years ago
so still it must be said
the judgments of the lord are true and righteous altogether
with malice toward none
with charity for all
with firmness in the right as god gives us to see the right
let us strive on to finish the work we are in
to bind up the nation's wounds
to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan
to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations

proclamation offering pardon to deserters
march 11
1865 by the president of the united states of america a proclamation whereas

all persons who have deserted the military or naval service of the united states who shall not return to said service or report themselves to a provost marshal within sixty days after the proclamation hereinafter mentioned
shall be deemed and taken to have voluntarily relinquished and forfeited their citizenship and their right to become citizens
and such deserters shall be forever incapable of holding any office of trust or profit under the united states
or of exercising any rights of citizens thereof and all persons who shall hereafter desert the military or naval service
and all persons who
being duly enrolled
shall depart the jurisdiction of the district in which they are enrolled
or go beyond the limits of the united states with intent to avoid any draft into the military or naval service duly ordered
shall be liable to the penalties of this section and the president is hereby authorized and required forthwith
on the passage of this act
to issue his proclamation setting forth the provisions of this section
in which proclamation the president is requested to notify all deserters returning within sixty days as aforesaid that they shall be pardoned on condition of returning to their regiments and companies

shall be pardoned on condition that they return to their regiments or companies or to such other organization as they may be assigned to
and serve the remainder of their original terms of enlistment

every one likes a compliment
thank you for yours on my little notification speech and on the recent inaugural address
i expect the latter to wear as well as perhaps better than anything i have produced but i believe it is not immediately popular
men are not flattered by being shown that there has been a difference of purpose between the almighty and them
to deny it
in this case
is to deny that there is a god governing the world
it is a truth which i thought needed to be told
as whatever of humiliation there is in it falls most directly on myself
i thought others might afford for me to tell it

the rock island case referred to
was my individual enterprise and it caused so much difficulty in so many ways that i promised to never undertake another
address to an indiana regiment
march 17
it will be but a very few words that i shall undertake to say
i was born in kentucky
raised in indiana
and lived in illinois and now i am here
where it is my business to care equally for the good people of all the states
i am glad to see an indiana regiment on this day able to present the captured flag to the governor of indiana
i am not disposed
in saying this
to make a distinction between the states
for all have done equally well
there are but few views or aspects of this great war upon which i have not said or written something whereby my own opinions might be known
but there is one the recent attempt of our erring brethren
as they are sometimes called
to employ the negro to fight for them
i have neither written nor made a speech on that subject
because that was their business
not mine
and if i had a wish on the subject
i had not the power to introduce it
or make it effective
the great question with them was whether the negro
being put into the army
will fight for them
i do not know
and therefore cannot decide
they ought to know better than me
i have in my lifetime heard many arguments why the negroes ought to be slaves but if they fight for those who would keep them in slavery
it will be a better argument than any i have yet heard
he who will fight for that
ought to be a slave
they have concluded
at last
to take one out of four of the slaves and put them in the army
and that one out of the four who will fight to keep the others in slavery
ought to be a slave himself
unless he is killed in a fight
while i have often said that all men ought to be free
yet would i allow those colored persons to be slaves who want to be
and next to them those white people who argue in favor of making other people slaves
i am in favor of giving an appointment to such white men to try it on for these slaves
i will say one thing in regard to the negroes being employed to fight for them
i do know he cannot fight and stay at home and make bread too
and as one is about as important as the other to them
i don't care which they do
i am rather in favor of having them try them as soldiers
they lack one vote of doing that
and i wish i could send my vote over the river so that i might cast it in favor of allowing the negro to fight
but they cannot fight and work both
we must now see the bottom of the enemy's resources
they will stand out as long as they can
and if the negro will fight for them they must allow him to fight
they have drawn upon their last branch of resources
and we can now see the bottom
i am glad to see the end so near at hand
i have said now more than i intended
and will therefore bid you good by

smith and franklin w
march 18
i am unwilling for the sentence to stand
and be executed
to any extent in this case
in the absence of a more adequate motive than the evidence discloses
i am wholly unable to believe in the existence of criminal or fraudulent intent on the part of men of such well established good character
if the evidence went as far to establish a guilty profit of one or two hundred thousand dollars
as it does of one or two hundred dollars
the case would
on the question of guilt
bear a far different aspect
that on this contract
involving some twelve hundred thousand dollars
the contractors would plan
and attempt to execute a fraud which
at the most
could profit them only one or two hundred
or even one thousand dollars
is to my mind beyond the power of rational belief
that they did not
in such a case
make far greater gains
proves that they did not
with guilty or fraudulent intent
make at all

and declared null
and the defendants are fully discharged

later he telegraphed again as follows
our troops
after being driven back to the boydton plank road
turned and drove the enemy in turn
and took the white oak road
which we now have
this gives us the ground occupied by the enemy this morning
i will send you a rebel flag captured by our troops in driving the enemy back

in the field
secretary seward was thrown from his carriage yesterday and seriously injured
with other matters
will take me to washington soon
i was at richmond yesterday and the day before
when and where judge campbell
who was with messrs
hunter and stephens in february
called on me
and made such representations as induced me to put in his hands an informal paper
repeating the propositions in my letter of instructions to mr
which you remember
and adding that if the war be now further persisted in by the rebels
confiscated property shall at the least bear the additional cost
and that confiscation shall be remitted to the people of any state which will now promptly and in good faith withdraw its troops and other support from resistance to the government
judge campbell thought it not impossible that the rebel legislature of virginia would do the latter if permitted and accordingly i addressed a private letter to general weitzel
with permission to judge campbell to see it
telling him general weitzel that if they attempt this
to permit and protect them
unless they attempt something hostile to the united states
in which case to give them notice and time to leave
and to arrest any remaining after such time
i do not think it very probable that anything win come of this
but i have thought best to notify you so that if you should see signs you may understand them
from your recent despatches it seems that you are pretty effectually withdrawing the virginia troops from opposition to the government
nothing that i have done

is to delay

last public address
april 11
1865 fellow citizens we meet this evening not in sorrow
but in gladness of heart
the evacuation of petersburg and richmond
and the surrender of the principal insurgent army
give hope of a righteous and speedy peace
whose joyous expression cannot be restrained
in the midst of this
he from whom blessings flow must not be forgotten
a call for a national thanksgiving is being prepared
and will be duly promulgated
nor must those whose harder part gives us the cause of rejoicing be overlooked
their honors must not be parceled out with others
i myself was near the front
and had the pleasure of transmitting much of the good news to you
but no part of the honor for plan or execution is mine
to general grant
his skillful officers
and brave men
all belongs
the gallant navy stood ready
but was not in reach to take active part
by these recent successes
the reinauguration of the national authority reconstruction which has had a large share of thought from the first
is pressed much more closely upon our attention
it is fraught with great difficulty
unlike a case of war between independent nations
there is no authorized organ for us to treat with no one man has authority to give up the rebellion for any other man
we simply must begin with and mould from disorganized and discordant elements
nor is it a small additional embarrassment that we
the loyal people
differ among ourselves as to the mode
and measure of reconstruction
as a general rule
i abstain from reading the reports of attacks upon myself
wishing not to be provoked by that to which i cannot properly offer an answer
in spite of this precaution
it comes to my knowledge that i am much censured for some supposed agency in setting up and seeking to sustain the new state government of louisiana
in this i have done just so much and no more than the public knows
in the annual message of december
and the accompanying proclamation
i presented a plan of reconstruction
as the phrase goes
which i promised
if adopted by any state
would be acceptable to and sustained by the executive government of the nation
i distinctly stated that this was not the only plan that might possibly be acceptable
and i also distinctly protested that the executive claimed no right to say when or whether members should be admitted to seats in congress from such states
this plan was in advance submitted to the then cabinet
and approved by every member of it
one of them suggested that i should then and in that connection apply the emancipation proclamation to the theretofore excepted parts of virginia and louisiana that i should drop the suggestion about apprenticeship for freed people
and that i should omit the protest against my own power in regard to the admission of members of congress
but even he approved every part and parcel of the plan which has since been employed or touched by the action of louisiana
the new constitution of louisiana
declaring emancipation for the whole state
practically applies the proclamation to the part previously excepted
it does not adopt apprenticeship for freed people
and is silent
as it could not well be otherwise
about the admission of members to congress
so that
as it applied to louisiana
every member of the cabinet fully approved the plan
the message went to congress
and i received many commendations of the plan
written and verbal
and not a single objection to it from any professed emancipationist came to my knowledge until after the news reached washington that the people of louisiana had begun to move in accordance with it
from about july
i had corresponded with different persons supposed to be interested in seeking a reconstruction of a state government for louisiana
when the message of 1863
with the plan before mentioned
reached new orleans
general banks wrote me that he was confident that the people
with his military co operation
would reconstruct substantially on that plan
i wrote to him and some of them to try it
they tried it
and the result is known
such has been my only agency in getting up the louisiana government
as to sustaining it my promise is out
as before stated
as bad promises are better broken than kept
i shall treat this as a bad promise and break it
whenever i shall be convinced that keeping it is adverse to the public interest but i have not yet been so convinced
i have been shown a letter on this subject
supposed to be an able one
in which the writer expresses regret that my mind has not seemed to be definitely fixed upon the question whether the seceded states
so called
are in the union or out of it
it would perhaps add astonishment to his regret were he to learn that since i have found professed union men endeavoring to answer that question
i have purposely forborne any public expression upon it
as appears to me
that question has not been nor yet is a practically material one
and that any discussion of it
while it thus remains practically immaterial
could have no effect other than the mischievous one of dividing our friends
as yet
whatever it may become
that question is bad as the basis of a controversy
and good for nothing at all a merely pernicious abstraction
we all agree that the seceded states
so called
are out of their proper practical relation with the union
and that the sole object of the government
civil and military
in regard to those states
is to again get them into their proper practical relation
i believe that it is not only possible
but in fact easier
to do this without deciding or even considering whether those states have ever been out of the union
than with it
finding themselves safely at home
it would be utterly immaterial whether they had been abroad
let us all join in doing the acts necessary to restore the proper practical relations between these states and the union
and each forever after innocently indulge his own opinion whether
in doing the acts he brought the states from without into the union
or only gave them proper assistance
they never having been out of it
the amount of constituency
so to speak
on which the louisiana government rests
would be more satisfactory to all if it contained fifty thousand
or thirty thousand
or even twenty thousand
instead of twelve thousand
as it does
it is also unsatisfactory to some that the elective franchise is not given to the colored man
i would myself prefer that it were now conferred on the very intelligent
and on those who serve our cause as soldiers
the question is not whether the louisiana government
as it stands
is quite all that is desirable
the question is
will it be wiser to take it as it is and help to improve it
or to reject and disperse
can louisiana be brought into proper practical relation with the union sooner by sustaining or by discarding her new state government
some twelve thousand voters in the heretofore slave state of louisiana have sworn allegiance to the union
assumed to be the rightful political power of the state
held elections
organized a state government
adopted a free state constitution
giving the benefit of public schools equally to black and white
and empowering the legislature to confer the elective franchise upon the colored man
this legislature has already voted to ratify the constitutional amendment recently passed by congress
abolishing slavery throughout the nation
these twelve thousand persons are thus fully committed to the union and to perpetuate freedom in the state committed to the very things
and nearly all things
the nation wants and they ask the nation's recognition and its assistance to make good this committal
if we reject and spurn them
we do our utmost to disorganize and disperse them
in fact
say to the white man
you are worthless or worse we will neither help you nor be helped by you
to the blacks we say
this cup of liberty which these
your old masters
held to your lips
we will dash from you
and leave you to the chances of gathering the spilled and scattered contents in some vague and undefined when
and how
if this course
discouraging and paralyzing both white and black
has any tendency to bring louisiana into proper practical relations with the union
i have so far been unable to perceive it
on the contrary
we recognize and sustain the new government of louisiana
the converse of all this is made true
we encourage the hearts and nerve the arms of twelve thousand to adhere to their work
and argue for it
and proselyte for it
and fight for it
and feed it
and grow it
and ripen it to a complete success
the colored man
in seeing all united for him
is inspired with vigilance
and energy
and daring to the same end
grant that he desires the elective franchise
will he not attain it sooner by saving the already advanced steps towards it
than by running backward over them
concede that the new government of louisiana is only to what it should be as the egg is to the fowl
we shall sooner have the fowl by hatching the egg than by smashing it
if we reject louisiana
we also reject one vote in favor of the proposed amendment to the national constitution
to meet this proposition
it has been argued that no more than three fourths of those states which have not attempted secession are necessary to validly ratify the amendment
i do not commit myself against this
further than to say that such a ratification would be questionable
and sure to be persistently questioned
while a ratification by three fourths of all the states would be unquestioned and unquestionable
i repeat the question
can louisiana be brought into proper practical relation with the union sooner by sustaining or by discarding her new state government
what has been said of louisiana will apply to other states
and yet so great peculiarities pertain to each state
and such important and sudden changes occur in the same state
and withal so new and unprecedented is the whole case
that no exclusive and inflexible plan can safely be prescribed as to details and collaterals
such exclusive and inflexible plan would surely become a new entanglement
important principles may and must be inflexible
in the present situation as the phrase goes
it may be my duty to make some new announcement to the people of the south
i am considering
and shall not fail to act
when satisfied that action will be proper

major general weitzel
i have just seen judge campbell's letter to you of the 7th
he assumes
as appears to me
that i have called the insurgent legislature of virginia together
as the rightful legislature of the state
to settle all differences with the united states
i have done no such thing
i spoke of them
not as a legislature
but as the gentlemen who have acted as the legislature of virginia in support of the rebellion
i did this on purpose to exclude the assumption that i was recognizing them as a rightful body
i deal with them as men having power de facto to do a specific thing
to wit
to withdraw the virginia troops and other support from resistance to the general government
for which
in the paper handed judge campbell
i promised a specific equivalent
to wit
a remission to the people of the state
except in certain cases
of the confiscation of their property
i meant this
and no more
as judge campbell misconstrues this
and is still pressing for an armistice
contrary to the explicit statement of the paper i gave him
and particularly as general grant has since captured the virginia troops
so that giving a consideration for their withdrawal is no longer applicable
let my letter to you and the paper to judge campbell both be withdrawn
or countermanded
and he be notified of it
do not now allow them to assemble
but if any have come
allow them safe return to their homes
interview with schuyler colfax on the morning of april 14
i want you to take a message from me to the miners whom you visit
i have very large ideas of the mineral wealth of our nation
i believe it practically inexhaustible
it abounds all over the western country
from the rocky mountains to the pacific
and its development has scarcely commenced
during the war
when we were adding a couple of millions of dollars every day to our national debt
i did not care about encouraging the increase in the volume of our precious metals
we had the country to save first
but now that the rebellion is overthrown
and we know pretty nearly the amount of our national debt
the more gold and silver we mine
we make the payment of that debt so much the easier
said he
speaking with more emphasis
i am going to encourage that in every possible way
we shall have hundreds of thousands of disbanded soldiers
and many have feared that their return home in such great numbers might paralyze industry
by furnishing
a greater supply of labor than there will be demand for
i am going to try to attract them to the hidden wealth of our mountain ranges
where there is room enough for all
which even the war has not stopped
will land upon our shores hundreds of thousands more per year from overcrowded europe
i intend to point them to the gold and silver that wait for them in the west
tell the miners for me
that i shall promote their interests to the utmost of my ability because their prosperity is the prosperity of the nation and
said he
his eye kindling with enthusiasm
we shall prove
in a very few years
that we are indeed the treasury of the world

ashmer and friend to come in at 9 a
april 14
lincoln's second inaugural address march 4
1865 fellow countrymen
at this second appearing to take the oath of the presidential office
there is less occasion for an extended address than there was at the first
then a statement
somewhat in detail
of a course to be pursued
seemed fitting and proper
at the expiration of four years
during which public declarations have been constantly called forth on every point and phase of the great contest which still absorbs the attention and engrosses the energies of the nation
little that is new could be presented
the progress of our arms
upon which all else chiefly depends
is as well known to the public as to myself and it is
i trust
reasonably satisfactory and encouraging to all
with high hope for the future
no prediction in regard to it is ventured
on the occasion corresponding to this four years ago
all thoughts were anxiously directed to an impending civil war
all dreaded it all sought to avert it
while the inaugural address was being delivered from this place
devoted altogether to saving the union without war
insurgent agents were in the city seeking to destroy it without war seeking to dissolve the union
and divide effects
by negotiation
both parties deprecated war but one of them would make war rather than let the nation survive and the other would accept war rather than let it perish
and the war came
one eighth of the whole population were colored slaves
not distributed generally over the union
but localized in the southern part of it
these slaves constituted a peculiar and powerful interest
all knew that this interest was
the cause of the war
to strengthen
and extend this interest was the object for which the insurgents would rend the union
even by war while the government claimed no right to do more than to restrict the territorial enlargement of it
neither party expected for the war the magnitude or the duration which it has already attained
neither anticipated that the cause of the conflict might cease with
or even before
the conflict itself should cease
each looked for an easier triumph
and a result less fundamental and astounding
both read the same bible
and pray to the same god and each invokes his aid against the other
it may seem strange that any men should dare to ask a just god's assistance in wringing their bread from the sweat of other men's faces but let us judge not
that we be not judged
the prayers of both could not be answered that of neither has been answered fully
the almighty has his own purposes
woe unto the world because of offenses
for it must needs be that offenses come but woe to that man by whom the offense cometh
if we shall suppose that american slavery is one of those offenses which
in the providence of god
must needs come
but which
having continued through his appointed time
he now wills to remove
and that he gives to both north and south this terrible war
as the woe due to those by whom the offense came
shall we discern therein any departure from those divine attributes which the believers in a living god always ascribe to him
fondly do we hope fervently do we pray that this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away
if god wills that it continue until all the wealth piled by the bondsman's two hundred and fifty years of unrequited toil shall be sunk
and until every drop of blood drawn by the lash shall be paid by another drawn with the sword
as was said three thousand years ago
so still it must be said
the judgments of the lord are true and righteous altogether
with malice toward none with charity for all with firmness in the right
as god gives us to see the right
let us strive on to finish the work we are in to bind up the nation's wounds to care for him who shall have borne the battle
and for his widow
and his orphan to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves
and with all nations

1859 notes introduction the facts of lincoln's early life are best stated in his own words
communicated in 1859 see appendix to mr
of bloomington
unlike many men who have risen from humble surroundings
lincoln never boasted of his wonderful struggle with poverty
his nature had no room for the false pride of a mr
even though the facts warranted the claim
he seldom mentioned his early life at all
on one occasion he referred to it as the short and simple annals of the poor
lincoln himself did not in any way base his claims to public recognition upon the fact that he was born in a log cabin and that he had split rails in his youth
on the other hand
he was not ashamed of the facts
than any other man of his time he believed and by his actions realized the truth of burns' saying
the man's the goud
for a' that
the real lesson to be drawn from lincoln's life is that under any conditions real success is to be won by intelligent
unwavering effort
the degree of success being determined by the ability and character of the individual
still less profitable is the attempt to contrast the success of lincoln with that of washington
or jefferson or of any other american whose early circumstances were more favorable than lincoln's
in each case success has been worthily won
and we americans of the present generation should rejoice that our country has produced so many great men
true patriotism does not consist in the recognition of only one type of americanism
but rather in the grateful acceptance of every service that advances the fortunes and raises the reputation of the republic
peculiar interest attaches to the character of lincoln's early reading and especially to the small number of books that were accessible to him
in these days of cheap and plentiful literature it is hard for us to realize the conditions in pioneer kentucky and indiana
where half a dozen volumes formed a family library and even newspapers were few and far between
there was no room for mental dissipation
and the few precious volumes that could be obtained were read and re read until their contents were fully mastered
when sir henry irving was asked to prepare a list of the hundred best books he replied
before a hundred books
commend me to the reading of two
the bible and shakespeare
fortunately these two classics came at an early age within the reach of lincoln and the frequency with which he quotes from both at all periods of his career
both in his writings and in his conversation
shows that he had made good use of them
the boy lincoln not only read books
he made copious extracts from them
often using a smooth shingle in the absence of paper and depending upon the uncertain light of the log fire in his father's cabin
such use of books makes for intellectual growth
and much of lincoln's later success as a writer can be referred back to this careful method of reading
lincoln's later reading shows considerable variety within certain limits
he himself once remarked that he liked little sad songs
among
his special favorites in this class of poetry were ben bolt
the lament of the irish emigrant
holmes' the last leaf
and charles mackay's the enquiry
the poem from which he most frequently quoted and which seems to have impressed him most was
why should the spirit of mortal be proud
his own marked tendency to melancholy
which is reflected in his face
seemed to respond to appeals of this sort
among his favorite poets besides shakespeare were burns
and lowell
many of the poems in his personal anthology were picked from the poets' corner of newspapers
and it was in this way that he became acquainted with longfellow
lincoln was especially fond of humorous writings
both in prose and verse
a taste that is closely connected with his lifelong fondness for funny stories
his favorite humorous writer during the presidential period was petroleum v
nasby david p
from whose letters he frequently read to more or less sympathetic listeners
it was eminently characteristic of lincoln that the presentation to the cabinet of the emancipation proclamation was prefaced by the reading of the latest nasby letter
lincoln's statement in the autobiography that he had picked up the little advance he had made upon his early education
or rather lack of education
is altogether too modest
it is known that after his term in congress he studied and mastered geometry and
like washington
he early became a successful surveyor
his study of the law
was characteristically thorough
and his skill in debate
in which he had no superior
was the result of careful preparation
during the presidential period lincoln gave evidence of critical ability that is little short of marvellous in a man whose schooling amounted to less than a year
in a letter to the actor hackett and in several conversations he analyzed passages from hamlet
macbeth
and other plays with an insight and sympathy that have rarely been surpassed even by eminent literary critics
at an early age lincoln's interest was aroused in public speaking and he soon began to exercise himself in this direction and to attend meetings addressed by those skilled in the art of oratory
many stories are told of his local reputation as a speaker and story teller even before he moved to illinois
much of his success then as in later life being due to the singular charm of his personality
lincoln never overcame a certain awkwardness
almost uncouthness of appearance
and he never acquired the finer arts of oratory for which his rival douglas was so conspicuous
but in spite of these physical difficulties he was acknowledged by douglas to be the man whom he most feared in debate and lincoln was able to sway the critical
unfamiliar audience assembled in cooper union as readily as the ruder crowds gathered about the illinois stump
on the subject of lincoln's religious belief
about which such varying opinions have been held
it is sufficient to state that
although he was not a member of any religious body
he had a firm conviction of the protecting power of providence and the efficacy of special prayer
this latter characteristic seems to have been especially developed during the presidential period
both in his proclamations and in many private interviews and communications he expresses himself clearly and emphatically upon this subject
it is probable
that lincoln read more deeply and more frequently in the bible during the storm and stress of the civil war than at any other period of his life
there seems to be no authority for the statement sometimes made that after the death of his son willie
lincoln showed a tendency to believe in the doctrines of spiritualism
he was not free
from a belief in the significance of dreams as portending important events
he was also not a little of a fatalist
as he himself once stated to his friend arnold
perhaps the most striking characteristic of lincoln's personality apart from his honesty and sincerity was his perfect simplicity and naturalness
frederick a
the great leader of the colored race
once remarked that president lincoln was the only white man that he had ever met who never suggested by his manner a sense of superiority
not that lincoln was lacking in personal dignity
neither as a practising lawyer nor as president of the united states
would he permit anyone to take what he regarded as liberties with him
on the other hand
he did not allow his elevated position to change his personal relations
his old illinois friends found in the white house the same cordial welcome and simple manners to which they had been accustomed in the pleasant home at springfield
during the first few weeks of the administration it was believed by many persons
including mr
seward himself
that president lincoln would be greatly influenced in his policy by the superior experience in public affairs of his secretary of state
seward even went so far as to draw up a plan of action
which he submitted to his chief
lincoln soon showed
that he was not a follower
but a leader of men
beneath whose good nature and kindly spirit was a power of initiative that has rarely been equalled among the statesmen of the world
even the dictatorial secretary of war found it necessary to yield to the president on all points that the latter regarded as being fundamental
few other presidents have been so bitterly attacked and so cruelly misrepresented as lincoln
but nothing could turn him from his purpose when that was once formed
like the wise man that he was
lincoln was always ready to listen to the suggestions of others
but the conclusion finally reached by him was always his own
he applied to questions of state the same methods of careful
impartial inquiry that had served him so well as a lawyer on the illinois circuit
and if
being human
he did not always avoid committing errors
he never acted from impulse or prejudice
lincoln was a strong leader
but he was at the same time a wise leader
turning now from the man to his works
we note first that the development of lincoln's style was slow
one might almost be tempted to say that lincoln developed several different styles in succession
is hardly true
for in spite of the numerous marked changes and improvements in lincoln's manner of writing
certain fundamental qualities remained
the real expression of his personality
that is
the real style of lincoln
from the beginning to the end we find an effort to say something and to say it in as clear a manner as possible
an effort without which there can be no real success in writing
after a practice in public speaking of over thirty years lincoln as president could still say
i believe i shall never be old enough to speak without embarrassment when i have nothing to talk about
the first specimen of lincoln's writings that has been preserved is a communication to the voters of sangamon county in 1832
when lincoln was for the first time a candidate for the state legislature
it is significant of lincoln's imperfect command of english at that time that some of the grammatical errors were corrected by a friend before the circular was issued
although this circumstance makes it impossible for us to judge exactly what his style was at this period
we may be sure that the changes were comparatively slight and that the general form at least was lincoln's
the question naturally arises whether there is anything in this first specimen of lincoln's writing that suggests
however remotely
the gettysburg address and the second inaugural
a little study will discover suggestions at least of the later manner
just as in the uncouth and awkward young candidate for the illinois state legislature
we can note many traits
intellectual and moral
that distinguish the mature and well poised statesman of thirty years later
it is the same man
but developed and strengthened
it is the same style
strengthened and refined
if nicolay and hay go too far when they say of the address
this is almost precisely the style of his later years
it would be quite as wrong to deny any likeness between the two
in the first place
we have the same severely logical treatment of the subject matter
from which lincoln
a lawyer and public speaker
never departed
lincoln's grammar may not have been impeccable at this time
but his thinking powers were already little short of masterly
is the first element in the makeup of lincoln's style
the ability to think straight and consequently to write straight
his legal training
which was then very meagre
cannot account for his logical thinking it is more correct to say that he later became a successful lawyer because of the logical bent of his mind
closely connected with this early development of the form of thinking was lincoln's interest in words
and his desire always to use words with a perfect understanding of their meaning
even in his boyhood he found pleasure in discovering the exact meaning of a new word and in later life he was constantly adding to his verbal stores
shortly before his inauguration lincoln remarked to a clergyman
who had asked him how he had acquired his remarkable power of putting things
i can say this
that among my earliest recollections i remember how
when a mere child
i used to get irritated when anybody talked to me in a way i could not understand
i don't think i ever got angry at anything else in my life
but that always disturbed my temper
and has ever since
i can remember going to my little bedroom
after hearing the neighbors talk of an evening with my father
and spending no small part of the night walking up and down
trying to make out what was the exact meaning of their
to me
dark sayings
in this first address we find no loose use of words
the character of the address does not of course admit of ornament or figurative language
but any subject
however simple
admits of digressions and mental excursions by the illogical and careless writer
of these there is not a trace
even in the most informal letters and telegrams
written at post haste and at times under the most extreme pressure of business and anxiety
lincoln shows a natural feeling for the appropriate expression that is found only in the masters of language
five years later
in 1837
the interval being represented by only a few unimportant letters
lincoln entered upon a period distinguished by qualities that are not usually associated with his name
a tendency to fine writing that we should look for earlier than at the age of twenty eight
the subject of the address is the perpetuation of our political institutions
and the complete text is given in this volume
here for once lincoln speaks of an alexander
a buonoparte
a washington
the influence of webster is apparent
in this first purely oratorical attempt of lincoln's
it could hardly have been otherwise at a time when the great whig orator was making the whole country ring with his wonderful speeches
it is almost certain
that henry clay
to whom lincoln later referred as beau ideal of an orator
had a part in moulding this early manner
though this is probably less apparent here than in the later soberer addresses
but it must not be supposed that this speech consists merely of what hamlet would call words
neither are all the figures inferior and commonplace
although it is more ornate than anything in the later period
the following description of the passing away of the heroes of the revolution is a fine example of the websterian style
they were a forest of giant oaks but the all resistless hurricane has swept over them
and left only here and there a lonely trunk
despoiled of its verdure
shorn of its foliage
unshading and unshaded
to murmur in a few more ruder storms
then to sink and be no more
the closing sentence of the address is almost wholly
in the later style and might have served for the close of the first inaugural
in its original form
did actually contain a biblical quotation
that the rhetorical manner had not gained entire possession of lincoln at that time
but was simply used by him on what seemed to be appropriate occasions
is sufficiently shown by a speech delivered in the legislature early in 1839
in which we find the strictly logical discussion of the first address
this speech is especially interesting because of the fact that it is the earliest encounter of lincoln and douglas that has been preserved
in a way
it may be regarded as the first lincoln douglas debate
one other rhetorical effort was made
in 1842
and then we find no more specimens of this class of speaking until the so called lost speech of 1856
this address of 1842 was delivered before the springfield washingtonian temperance society
on washington's birthday
and it is even more inflated than the first specimen
combined with the rhetoric
there is a mass of sober argument that again suggests the later lincoln
the arguments
are characterized by a sound common sense that is no less characteristic of the speaker
the peroration deserves quotation as being one of the finest and at the same time one of the least familiar passages in lincoln's writings
this is the one hundredth and tenth anniversary of the birthday of washington
we are met to celebrate this day
washington is the mightiest name of earth
long since mightiest in the cause of civil liberty
still mightiest in moral reformation
on that name a eulogy is expected
it cannot be
to add brightness to the sun or glory to the name of washington is alike impossible
let none attempt it
in solemn awe pronounce the name
and in its naked
deathless splendor leave it shining on
this approaches very closely the beauty and strength of the presidential period
in 1844 lincoln wrote several poems
which are not without merit
as a boy he was famous among his companions for his skill in writing humorous verses
but these later specimens of his muse are serious
even melancholy in their tone
we next come to the congressional period
from 1847 to 1849
the best known speech from this period
lincoln's introduction to a national public
is that of july 27
on general taylor and the veto
taylor being then the whig candidate for the presidency
this speech
which was received with immense applause
owes its special prominence to the fact that it is the only purely humorous speech by lincoln that has been preserved
the subject of the attack is general cass
taylor's democratic opponent
whom lincoln treats in a manner that somewhat suggests douglas' later treatment of lincoln on the stump
its peroration is of peculiar interest
since it consists of a funny story
to anyone familiar with lincoln's habit of story telling the introduction of a story at the end of a speech may not seem strange
as a matter of fact
this is the only case of the kind that has been noted
and a careful reading of the speeches shows either that they were not fully reported or that as a rule he confined his story telling to conversation
even in the debates with douglas
when he was addressing illinois crowds from the stump at a time when stories were even more popular than they are now
lincoln seldom used this device to rouse interest or to strengthen his argument
a partial explanation of this curious contrast between his conversation and his writing
so far as the debates are concerned
may be found in a remark made by lincoln to a friend who had urged him to treat the subject more popularly
lincoln said the occasion is too serious
the issues are too grave
i do not seek applause
or to amuse the people
but to convince them
with lincoln the desire to prove his proposition
whatever it might be
was always uppermost
in the earliest speeches were noted the severe logic and the strict adherence to the subject in hand
to the end lincoln never changed this principle of his public speaking
although the stories
have but little direct bearing upon lincoln's writings
they are so characteristic a feature of the man that they cannot be wholly disregarded
in the two cases already noted the stories were illustrative
and this appears to be true of all of lincoln's anecdotes
whether they occur in his conversation or in his writings
he apparently never dragged in stories for their own sake
as so many conversational bores are in the habit of doing
but the story was suggested by or served to illustrate some incident or principle
in aptness of illustration lincoln has never been surpassed
emerson said of him
i am sure if this man had ruled in a period of less facility of printing
he would have become mythological in a very few years
like aesop or pilpay
or one of the seven wise masters
by his fables and proverbs
many of the anecdotes attributed to lincoln are undoubtedly to be referred to other sources
but the number of authentic stories noted
especially during the presidency
is very large
the question has often been raised whether lincoln originated the stories he told so well
fortunately we have his own words in this matter
to noah brooks he said
i do generally remember a good story when i hear it
but i never did invent anything original
i am only a retail dealer
slightly differing from this
though probably not contradicting it
is lincoln's statement to mr
chauncey m
i have originated but two stories in my life
but i tell tolerably well other people's stories
during the civil war lincoln's stories served a special purpose as a sort of safety valve
to a congressman
who had remonstrated with him for his apparent frivolity in combining funny stories with serious discussion
he said
if it were not for these stories i should die
the addresses of the presidential period
with the exception of a few responses to serenades
are entirely without humorous anecdotes
although lincoln never hesitated to clear the discussion of the most momentous questions through the medium of a funny story
his sense of official and literary propriety made him confine them to informal occasions
the eulogy of henry clay of 1852 is of interest as being the only address of this kind that lincoln ever delivered
it might perhaps better be called an appreciation
and because of its sincerity and deep sympathy it may be regarded as a model of its kind
two years later lincoln engaged in his first real debate with douglas on the burning question of the day
the repeal of the missouri compromise
from the purely literary point of view the peoria speech is superior to the better known debates of four years later
while it lacks the finish and poise of the two inaugurals it is far more imaginative than the debates
one of its most striking features is the comparatively large number of quotations
both from the bible and from profane writings
although as a rule lincoln quotes sparingly
this one speech contains no fewer than twelve quotations
seven of these being from the bible
the only other speech that equals this one in the number of quotations is the so called lost speech of 1856
the authenticity of which is doubtful
the very much shorter second inaugural
with its four bible quotations
has a larger proportionate number
lincoln's quotations seem to be suggested emotionally rather than intellectually
this is indicated by the fact that the most emotional speeches contain the greatest number of quotations
the first inaugural
for example
which is in the main a sober statement of principles
intended to quiet rather than to excite passion
is four times as long as the emotional second inaugural
but contains only one quotation to the four of the other
we may note in this connection that almost exactly one half of the total number of quotations occurring in lincoln's writings are taken from the bible
and that a large proportion of the profane quotations are from shakespeare
lincoln was also fond of using proverbial sayings
a habit that emphasized his character as a popular or national writer
for most of his proverbs are local and many of them are intensely homely
quotations of this class occur at all periods of his life
beginning with the first address
and they are sometimes used in such unexpected places as official telegrams to officers in the field
strange to say
the maxim that is most frequently associated with lincoln's name cannot with any certainty be regarded as having been used by him
either as a quotation or as an original saying
you can fool all of the people some of the time
and some of the people all the time
but you cannot fool all the people all the time
at the first regular republican state convention in illinois
held at bloomington
may 29
lincoln delivered an address on the public issues of the day that roused the enthusiasm of his hearers to such a degree that the reporters forgot to take notes and therefore failed to furnish the text to their respective newspapers
in the course of time it came to be known as the lost speech
and such
in the opinion of many who were present on the occasion
it continued to be
a young lawyer from the neighboring town of champaign
later prepared a version based upon notes
from which some general idea of the character of the speech can perhaps be gained
the lincoln douglas debates furnish perhaps the best example of this class of public speaking that is available
although they were extempore
as far as the actual language is concerned
they have been preserved in full
in spite of the informal style appropriate to the stump
these discussions of the dred scott decision
popular sovereignty
and the other questions suggested by slavery are marked by a closeness of reasoning and a readiness of retort that show the great master in the difficult art of debate
these qualities are not confined to the one speaker
for his opponent was no less adroit and ready
we may well say in this connection
there were giants in those days
much of lincoln's success in these historic debates was due to his intense conviction of the righteousness of the cause for which he was pleading
as lawyer and political speaker lincoln always felt the necessity of believing in his case
he frequently refused to appear in suits because he could not put his heart into them
and he never defended a policy from mere party loyalty
much of lincoln's success as a speaker was due to the fact that his hearers felt that they could trust him
this is simply a new application of the old principle that the chief qualification for success in oratory is character
in reading a man's books we may forget his character for the time
but in listening to an orator we have the man himself constantly before us
and he himself makes or mars his success
in 1859 lincoln delivered his second and last long occasional address a discussion of agriculture at the wisconsin state fair at milwaukee
this is the only important non political speech by lincoln that has been preserved and it is interesting as showing his ability to treat a subject of general interest
as in his discussions of political questions
lincoln displayed true statesmanlike insight and foresight
long before the time when experiment stations and farmers' institutes began to teach the very principles that he so wisely and effectively expounded
in 1860 lincoln appeared for the first time before a new york audience and we have his own word for it that he suffered a severe attack of stage fright on that occasion
the event showed
that he had no reason to fear the judgment of one of the most critical audiences that ever assembled in the cooper union
the hon
joseph h
who was present
writes of his appearance
when he spoke he was transformed
his eye kindled
his voice rang
his face shone and seemed to light up the whole assembly
for an hour and a half he held his audience in the hollow of his hand
this address may be regarded as a precursor
and a worthy precursor
of the first inaugural
and by many competent critics it has been given the first place among the discussions of the political situation just before the war
after such a performance there could be no hesitation on the part of those that heard it in acknowledging abraham lincoln as one of the most powerful speakers of his day
before returning to illinois lincoln travelled through several of the new england states
making speeches in a number of the larger towns
the speeches delivered by lincoln on the journey to washington
in 1860
beginning with the exquisite farewell address at springfield
include some of the best of his shorter addresses
the most interesting of these is the one delivered in independence hall
the first inaugural address was not received at the time of its first publication in the newspapers
even at the north
with the general enthusiasm that we should now be inclined to assume and in the south it was severely criticised for its alleged lack of force and definiteness
its effect
upon the immense audience gathered in front of the capitol seems to have been immediate
the document had been written with great care at springfield
some changes being made after the arrival at washington
the most important of these were the substitution for the original closing paragraph of the beautiful peroration suggested by secretary seward
in beauty of language and elevation of thought this first public utterance by president lincoln may be compared to the great political utterances of burke
first among the little classics of the world stands the gettysburg address
at the time of its delivery it does not seem to have been generally accepted as a notable utterance
by many of the newspaper correspondents it was referred to as remarks by the president
and some of the papers contained no comment upon it
by others it was dismissed with a few words of mild praise
even after the death of lincoln there was no general agreement as to its supreme merits as a part of our national literature
conflicting stories still pass current in books and articles on lincoln about its composition
and original reception
an examination of the testimony shows that the following facts may be accepted as fairly proved
the greater part of the address was written in washington after very careful preparation
and profound reflection
the address was read from ms
but with some variations that apparently occurred to the speaker at the time of delivery
everett did not clasp the president's hand while he expressed a willingness to exchange his hundred pages for the twenty lines just read
it is uncertain whether lincoln said at the time that the address did not scour
but if he did use such an expression it was not because of a consciousness of having failed to make adequate preparation for the occasion
one of the best commentaries on the second inaugural address appeared in an article in the london spectator
we cannot read it without a renewed conviction that it is the noblest political document known to history
and should have for the nation and the statesmen he left behind him something of a sacred and almost prophetic character
carl schurz compared it to a sacred poem
and all discriminating readers agree in placing it by the side of the gettysburg address as an almost perfect specimen of pure english prose
the other addresses of the presidential period are
with the exception of the last speech
on the reconstruction of louisiana
of minor importance
they consist in the main of responses to serenades
a form of address which lincoln cordially detested and in which as a rule he achieved only a moderate degree of success
the cares of his great office made such cruel demands upon his time and strength that he declined many requests to speak in public
and whenever he did appear he confined his remarks within the smallest possible limits
lincoln was not a reader speaker and rarely did himself justice without careful preparation
writers on lincoln have failed to note the severe criticisms upon lincoln's impromptu remarks that appeared in the opposition press and in the english newspapers
even as late as 1863 newspaper writers not opposed to him did not hesitate to refer to the plainness of the president's public speaking
the messages to congress are distinguished from most documents of that class by their frequent purple patches
to the enumeration of dry facts furnished by the various departments they add an elevation and breadth of thought of the first order
in a class by themselves are the various proclamations
some of them of a purely formal character
such as those announcing blockades
others of a distinctly literary character
like the announcements of fasts and feasts
midway between these two classes is the most important of all
the emancipation proclamation of january 1
with the exception of the concluding sentence
is entirely free from ornament
perhaps lincoln felt here
as with the debates
that the occasion was too serious
not only for jesting but even for attempting the mere graces of language
mention should be made of the letters and telegrams written by president lincoln
although many letters have been preserved from earlier times
none make special claims to attention outside of the information that they furnish
but during the last four years of his life lincoln wrote some of the most beautiful letters that have ever been composed
one of these
the letter to mrs
has been given a place on the walls of one of the oxford colleges
as a model of noble english
the conkling letter and the letter to horace greeley are among the most important statements of lincoln's policy and are really short political tracts
the first inaugural can be traced through the cooper union address and the lincoln douglas debates
the peoria speech
and the speeches of 1854 to the seed of 1832
the plain
direct statement of principles of lincoln's first address to the public
the development of the gettysburg address and the second inaugural
those supreme expressions of lincoln's feelings
is not
in the main
to be traced through complete speeches
but it must be sought for in isolated passages
when he left logic for the moment and gave himself up to the passing emotion
the real seed of the majestic simplicity of those addresses is perhaps to be found in those rhetorical speeches of an early period
so lacking apparently in the qualities that we love and admire
in writing
as in so many other things
we reap not what we sow
but its fruition
the effect may seem very remotely related to the cause
but he would be a fool who would deny the relation between them

1832 fellow citizens
having become a candidate for the honorable office of one of your representatives in the next general assembly of this state
in accordance with an established custom and the principles of true republicanism
it becomes my duty to make known to you the people whom i propose to represent my sentiments with regard to local affairs
time and experience have verified to a demonstration
the public utility of internal improvements
that the poorest and most thinly populated countries would be greatly benefited by the opening of good roads
and in the clearing of navigable streams within their limits
is what no person will deny
but yet it is folly to undertake works of this or any other kind
without first knowing that we are able to finish them as half finished work generally proves to be labor lost
there cannot justly be any objection to having railroads and canals
any more than to other good things
provided they cost nothing
the only objection is to paying for them and the objection to paying arises from the want of ability to pay
with respect to the county of sangamon
some more easy means of communication than we now possess
for the purpose of facilitating the task of exporting the surplus products of its fertile soil
and importing necessary articles from abroad
are indispensably necessary
a meeting has been held of the citizens of jacksonville
and the adjacent country
for the purpose of deliberating and enquiring into the expediency of constructing a railroad from some eligible point on the illinois river
through the town of jacksonville
in morgan county
to the town of springfield in sangamon county
this is
a very desirable object
no other improvement that reason will justify us in hoping for
can equal in utility the railroad
it is a never failing source of communication
between places of business remotely situated from each other
upon the railroad the regular progress of commercial intercourse is not interrupted by either high or low water
or freezing weather
which are the principal difficulties that render our future hopes of water communication precarious and uncertain
however desirable an object the construction of a railroad through our country may be however high our imaginations may be heated at thoughts of it there is always a heart appalling shock accompanying the account of its cost
which forces us to shrink from our pleasing anticipations
the probable cost of this contemplated railroad is estimated at 290
000 the bare statement of which
in my opinion
is sufficient to justify the belief
that the improvement of the sangamon river is an object much better suited to our infant resources
respecting this view
i think i may say
without the fear of being contradicted
that its navigation may be rendered completely practicable
as high as the mouth of the south fork
or probably higher
to vessels of from 25 to 30 tons burthen
for at least one half of all common years
and to vessels of much greater burthen a part of that time
from my peculiar circumstances
it is probable that for the last twelve months i have given as particular attention to the stage of the water in this river
as any other person in the country
in the month of march
in company with others
i commenced the building of a flatboat on the sangamon
and finished and took her out in the course of the spring
since that time
i have been concerned in the mill at new salem
these circumstances are sufficient evidence
that i have not been very inattentive to the stages of the water
the time at which we crossed the milldam
being in the last days of april
the water was lower than it had been since the breaking of winter in february
or than it was for several weeks after
the principal difficulties we encountered in descending the river
were from the drifted timber
which obstructions all know is not difficult to be removed
knowing almost precisely the height of water at that time
i believe i am safe in saying that it has as often been higher as lower since
from this view of the subject
it appears that my calculations with regard to the navigation of the sangamon
cannot be unfounded in reason but whatever may be its natural advantages
certain it is
that it never can be practically useful to any great extent
without being greatly improved by art
the drifted timber
as i have before mentioned
is the most formidable barrier to this object
of all parts of this river
none will require so much labor in proportion
to make it navigable as the last thirty or thirty five miles and going with the meanderings of the channel
when we are this distance above its mouth
we are only between twelve and eighteen miles above beardstown in something near a straight direction
and this route is upon such low ground as to retain water in many places during the season
and in all parts such as to draw two thirds or three fourths of the river water at all stages
this route is up on prairieland the whole distance so that it appears to me
by removing the turf
a sufficient width
and damming up the old channel
the whole river in a short time would wash its way through
thereby curtailing the distance
and increasing the velocity of the current very considerably
while there would be no timber upon the banks to obstruct its navigation in future and being nearly straight
the timber which might float in at the head
would be apt to go clear through
there are also many places above this where the river
in its zigzag course
forms such complete peninsulas
as to be easier cut through at the necks than to remove the obstructions from the bends which if done
would also lessen the distance
what the cost of this work would be
i am unable to say
it is probable
that it would not be greater than is common to streams of the same length
i believe the improvement of the sangamon river
to be vastly important and highly desirable to the improvement of the county and if elected
any measure in the legislature having this for its object
which may appear judicious
will meet my approbation and shall receive my support
it appears that the practice of loaning money at exorbitant rates of interest
has already been opened as a field for discussion so i suppose i may enter upon it without claiming the honor
or risking the danger
which may await its first explorer
it seems as though we are never to have an end to this baneful and corroding system
acting almost as prejudicial to the general interests of the community as a direct tax of several thousand dollars annually laid on each county
for the benefit of a few individuals only
unless there be a law made setting a limit to the rates of usury
a law for this purpose
i am of opinion
may be made without materially injuring any class of people
in cases of extreme necessity there could always be means found to cheat the law
while in all other cases it would have its intended effect
i would not favor the passage of a law upon this subject which might be very easily evaded
let it be such that the labor and difficulty of evading it could only be justified in cases of greatest necessity
upon the subject of education
not presuming to dictate any plan or system respecting it
i can only say that i view it as the most important subject which we as a people can be engaged in
that every man may receive at least
a moderate education
and thereby be enabled to read the history of his own and other countries
by which he may duly appreciate the value of our free institutions
appears to be an object of vital importance
even on this account alone
to say nothing of the advantages and satisfaction to be derived from all being able to read the scriptures and other works
both of a religious and moral nature
for themselves
for my part
i desire to see the time when education
and by its means
enterprise and industry
shall become much more general than at present
and should be gratified to have it in my power to contribute something to the advancement of any measure which might have a tendency to accelerate the happy period
with regard to existing laws
some alterations are thought to be necessary
many respectable men have suggested that our estray laws the law respecting the issuing of executions
the road law
and some others
are deficient in their present form
and require alterations
but considering the great probability that the framers of those laws were wiser than myself
i should prefer not meddling with them
unless they were first attacked by others
in which case i should feel it both a privilege and a duty to take that stand
which in my view
might tend most to the advancement of justice
i shall conclude
considering the great degree of modesty which should always attend youth
it is probable i have already been more presuming than becomes me
upon the subjects of which i have treated
i have spoken as i thought
i may be wrong in regard to any or all of them but
holding it a sound maxim
that it is better to be only sometimes right
than at all times wrong
so soon as i discover my opinions to be erroneous
i shall be ready to renounce them
every man is said to have his peculiar ambition
whether it be true or not
i can say
for one
that i have no other so great as that of being truly esteemed of my fellow men
by rendering myself worthy of their esteem
how far i shall succeed in gratifying this ambition
is yet to be developed
i am young and unknown to many of you
i was born and have ever remained in the most humble walks of life
i have no wealthy or popular relations to recommend me
my case is thrown exclusively upon the independent voters of this county
and if elected they will have conferred a favor upon me
for which i shall be unremitting in my labors to compensate
if the good people in their wisdom shall see fit to keep me in the background
i have been too familiar with disappointments to be very much chagrined

the perpetuation of our political institutions
january 27
1837 in the great journal of things happening under the sun
the american people
find our account running under date of the nineteenth century of the christian era
we find ourselves in the peaceful possession of the fairest portion of the earth
as regards extent of territory
fertility of soil
and salubrity of climate
we find ourselves under the government of a system of political institutions conducing more essentially to the ends of civil and religious liberty than any of which the history of former times tells us
when mounting the stage of existence
found ourselves the legal inheritors of these fundamental blessings
we toiled not in the acquirement or establishment of them they are a legacy bequeathed us by a once hardy
and patriotic
but now lamented and departed
race of ancestors
theirs was the task and nobly they performed it to possess themselves
and through themselves us
of this goodly land
and to uprear upon its hills and its valleys a political edifice of liberty and equal rights 'tis ours only to transmit these
the former unprofaned by the foot of an invader the latter undecayed by the lapse of time and untorn by usurpation to the latest generation that fate shall permit the world to know
this task gratitude to our fathers
justice to ourselves
duty to posterity
and love for our species in general
all imperatively require us faithfully to perform
shall we perform it
at what point shall we expect the approach of danger
by what means shall we fortify against it
shall we expect some transatlantic military giant to step the ocean and crush us at a blow
all the armies of europe
and africa combined
with all the treasure of the earth our own excepted in their military chest
with a buonaparte for a commander
could not by force take a drink from the ohio or make a track on the blue ridge in a trial of a thousand years
at what point then is the approach of danger to be expected
i answer
if it ever reach us it must spring up amongst us
it cannot come from abroad
if destruction be our lot
we must ourselves be its author and finisher
as a nation of freemen we must live through all time
or die by suicide
i hope i am over wary but if i am not
there is
even now
something of ill omen amongst us
i mean the increasing disregard for law which pervades the country the growing disposition to substitute the wild and furious passions in lieu of the sober judgment of courts and the worse than savage mobs
for the executive ministers of justice
this disposition is awfully fearful in any community and that it now exists in ours
though grating to our feelings to admit
it would be a violation of truth and an insult to our intelligence to deny
accounts of outrages committed by mobs form the every day news of the times
they have pervaded the country from new england to louisiana they are neither peculiar to the eternal snows of the former nor the burning suns of the latter they are not the creature of climate
neither are they confined to the slave holding or the non slave holding states
alike they spring up among the pleasure hunting masters of southern slaves
and the order loving citizens of the land of steady habits
their cause may be
it is common to the whole country
it would be tedious as well as useless to recount the horrors of all of them
happening in the state of mississippi and at st
louis are
the most dangerous in example and revolting to humanity
in the mississippi case they first commenced by hanging the regular gamblers a set of men certainly not following for a livelihood a very useful or very honest occupation but one which
so far from being forbidden by the laws
was actually licensed by an act of the legislature passed but a single year before
next negroes suspected of conspiring to raise an insurrection were caught up and hanged in all parts of the state then
white men supposed to be leagued with the negroes and finally
strangers from neighboring states
going thither on business
in many instances
subjected to the same fate
thus went on this process of hanging
from gamblers to negroes
from negroes to white citizens
and from these to strangers
till dead men were seen literally dangling from the boughs of trees upon every roadside
and in numbers almost sufficient to rival the native spanish moss of the country
as a drapery of the forest
to that horror striking scene at st
a single victim only was sacrificed there
this story is very short
and is perhaps the most highly tragic of anything of its length that has ever been witnessed in real life
a mulatto man by the name of mcintosh was seized in the street
dragged to the suburbs of the city
chained to a tree
and actually burned to death and all within a single hour from the time he had been a freeman
attending to his own business and at peace with the world
such are the effects of mob law
and such are the scenes becoming more and more frequent in this land so lately famed for love of law and order
and the stories of which have even now grown too familiar to attract anything more than an idle remark
but you are perhaps ready to ask
what has this to do with the perpetuation of our political institutions
i answer
it has much to do with it
its direct consequences are
comparatively speaking
but a small evil
and much of its danger consists in the proneness of our minds to regard its direct as its only consequences
abstractly considered
the hanging of the gamblers at vicksburg was of but little consequence
they constitute a portion of population that is worse than useless in any community and their death
if no pernicious example be set by it
is never matter of reasonable regret with any one
if they were annually swept from the stage of existence by the plague or small pox
honest men would perhaps be much profited by the operation
similar too is the correct reasoning in regard to the burning of the negro at st
he had forfeited his life by the perpetration of an outrageous murder upon one of the most worthy and respectable citizens of the city
and had he not died as he did
he must have died by the sentence of the law in a very short time afterwards
as to him alone
it was as well the way it was as it could otherwise have been
but the example in either case was fearful
when men take it in their heads to day to hang gamblers or burn murderers
they should recollect that in the confusion usually attending such transactions they will be as likely to hang or burn some one who is neither a gambler nor a murderer as one who is
and that
acting upon the example they set
the mob of to morrow may
and probably will
hang or burn some of them by the very same mistake
and not only so the innocent
those who have ever set their faces against violations of law in every shape
alike with the guilty fall victims to the ravages of mob law and thus it goes on
step by step
till all the walls erected for the defence of the persons and property of individuals are trodden down and disregarded
but all this
is not the full extent of the evil
by such examples
by instances of the perpetrators of such acts going unpunished
the lawless in spirit are encouraged to become lawless in practice and having been used to no restraint but dread of punishment
they thus become absolutely unrestrained
having ever regarded government as their deadliest bane
they make a jubilee of the suspension of its operations
and pray for nothing so much as its total annihilation
on the other hand
good men
men who love tranquillity
who desire to abide by the laws and enjoy their benefits
who would gladly spill their blood in the defence of their country
seeing their property destroyed
their families insulted
and their lives endangered
their persons injured
and seeing nothing in prospect that forebodes a change for the better
become tired of and disgusted with a government that offers them no protection
and are not much averse to a change
in which they imagine they have nothing to lose
by the operation of this mobocratic spirit which all must admit is now abroad in the land
the strongest bulwark of any government
and particularly of those constituted like ours
may effectually be broken down and destroyed i mean the attachment of the people
whenever this effect shall be produced among us whenever the vicious portion of population shall be permitted to gather in bands of hundreds and thousands and burn churches
ravage and rob provision stores
throw printing presses into rivers
shoot editors
and hang and burn obnoxious persons at pleasure and with impunity
depend on it
this government cannot last
by such things the feelings of the best citizens will become more or less alienated from it
and thus it will be left without friends
or with too few
and those few too weak to make their friendship effectual
at such a time
and under such circumstances
men of sufficient talent and ambition will not be wanting to seize the opportunity
strike the blow
and overturn that fair fabric which for the last half century as been the fondest hope of the lovers of freedom throughout the world
i know the american people are much attached to their government i know they would suffer much for its sake i know they would endure evils long and patiently before they would ever think of exchanging it for another
notwithstanding all this
if the laws be continually despised and disregarded
if their rights to be secure in their persons and property are held by no better tenure than the caprice of a mob
the alienation of their affections from the government is the natural consequence and to that
sooner or later
it must come
is one point at which danger may be expected
the question recurs
how shall we fortify against it
the answer is simple
let every american
every lover of liberty
every well wisher to his posterity swear by the blood of the revolution never to violate in the least particular the laws of the country
and never to tolerate their violation by others
as the patriots of seventy six did to the support of the declaration of independence
so to the support of the constitution and laws let every american pledge his life
his property
and his sacred honor
let every man remember that to violate the law is to trample on the blood of his father
and to tear the charter of his own and his children's liberty
let reverence for the laws be breathed by every american mother to the lisping babe that prattles on her lap let it be taught in schools
in seminaries
and in colleges let it be written in primers
spelling books
and in almanacs let it be preached from the pulpit
proclaimed in legislative halls
and enforced in courts of justice
in short
let it become the political religion of the nation and let the old and the young
the rich and the poor
the grave and the gay of all sexes and tongues and colors and conditions
sacrifice unceasingly upon its altars
while ever a state of feeling such as this shall universally or even very generally prevail throughout the nation
vain will be every effort
and fruitless every attempt
to subvert our national freedom
when i so pressingly urge a strict observance of all the laws
let me not be understood as saying there are no bad laws
or that grievances may not arise for the redress of which no legal provisions have been made
i mean to say no such thing
but i do mean to say that although bad laws
if they exist
should be repealed as soon as possible
still they continue in force
for the sake of example they should be religiously observed
so also in unprovided cases
if such arise
let proper legal provisions be made for them with the least possible delay
till then
let them
if not too intolerable
be borne with
there is no grievance that is a fit object of redress by mob law
in any case that may arise
for instance
the promulgation of abolitionism
one of two positions is necessarily true that is
the thing is right within itself
and therefore deserves the protection of all law and all good citizens
it is wrong
and therefore proper to be prohibited by legal enactments and in neither case is the interposition of mob law either necessary
or excusable
but it may be asked
why suppose danger to our political institutions
have we not preserved them for more than fifty years
and why may we not for fifty times as long
we hope there is no sufficient reason
we hope all dangers may be overcome but to conclude that no danger may ever arise would itself be extremely dangerous
there are now
and will hereafter be
many causes
dangerous in their tendency
which have not existed heretofore
and which are not too insignificant to merit attention
that our government should have been maintained in its original form
from its establishment until now
is not much to be wondered at
it had many props to support it through that period
which now are decayed and crumbled away
through that period it was felt by all to be an undecided experiment now it is understood to be a successful one
all that sought celebrity and fame and distinction expected to find them in the success of that experiment
their all was staked upon it their destiny was inseparably linked with it
their ambition aspired to display before an admiring world a practical demonstration of the truth of a proposition which had hitherto been considered at best no better than problematical namely
the capability of a people to govern themselves
if they succeeded they were to be immortalized their names were to be transferred to counties
and cities
and rivers
and mountains and to be revered and sung
toasted through all time
if they failed
they were to be called knaves
and fools
and fanatics for a fleeting hour then to sink and be forgotten
they succeeded
the experiment is successful
and thousands have won their deathless names in making it so
but the game is caught and i believe it is true that with the catching end the pleasures of the chase
this field of glory is harvested
and the crop is already appropriated
but new reapers will arise
and they too will seek a field
it is to deny what the history of the world tells us is true
to suppose that men of ambition and talents will not continue to spring up amongst us
when they do
they will as naturally seek the gratification of their ruling passion as others have done before them
the question then is
can that gratification be found in supporting and maintaining an edifice that has been erected by others
most certainly it cannot
many great and good men
sufficiently qualified for any task they should undertake
may ever be found whose ambition would aspire to nothing beyond a seat in congress
a gubernatorial or a presidential chair but such belong not to the family of the lion
or the tribe of the eagle
think you these places would satisfy an alexander
a caesar
or a napoleon
towering genius disdains a beaten path
it seeks regions hitherto unexplored
it sees no distinction in adding story to story upon the monuments of fame erected to the memory of others
it denies that it is glory enough to serve under any chief
it scorns to tread in the footsteps of any predecessor
however illustrious
it thirsts and burns for distinction and if possible
it will have it
whether at the expense of emancipating slaves or enslaving freemen
is it unreasonable then
to expect that some man possessed of the loftiest genius
coupled with ambition sufficient to push it to its utmost stretch
will at some time spring up among us
and when such a one does
it will require the people to be united with each other
attached to the government and laws
and generally intelligent
to successfully frustrate his designs
distinction will be his paramount object
although he would as willingly
perhaps more so
acquire it by doing good as harm
that opportunity being past
and nothing left to be done in the way of building up
he would set boldly to the task of pulling down
here then is a probable case
highly dangerous
and such an one as could have well existed heretofore
another reason which once was
but which
to the same extent
is now no more
has done much in maintaining our institutions thus far
i mean the powerful influence which the interesting scenes of the revolution had upon the passions of the people as distinguished from their judgment
by this influence
the jealousy
and avarice incident to our nature
and so common to a state of peace
and conscious strength
were for the time in a great measure smothered and rendered inactive
while the deep rooted principles of hate
and the powerful motive of revenge
instead of being turned against each other
were directed exclusively against the british nation
and thus
from the force of circumstances
the basest principles of our nature were either made to lie dormant
or to become the active agents in the advancement of the noblest of causes that of establishing and maintaining civil and religious liberty
but this state of feeling must fade
is fading
has faded
with the circumstances that produced it
i do not mean to say that the scenes of the revolution are now or ever will be entirely forgotten
but that
like everything else
they must fade upon the memory of the world
and grow more and more dim by the lapse of time
in history
we hope
they will be read of
and recounted
so long as the bible shall be read but even granting that they will
their influence cannot be what it heretofore has been
even then they cannot be so universally known nor so vividly felt as they were by the generation just gone to rest
at the close of that struggle
nearly every adult male had been a participator in some of its scenes
the consequence was that of those scenes
in the form of a husband
a father
a son
or a brother
a living history was to be found in every family a history bearing the indubitable testimonies of its own authenticity
in the limbs mangled
in the scars of wounds received
in the midst of the very scenes related a history
that could be read and understood alike by all
the wise and the ignorant
the learned and the unlearned
but those histories are gone
they can be read no more forever
they were a fortress of strength but what invading foeman could never do
the silent artillery of time has done the levelling of its walls
they are gone
they were a forest of giant oaks but the all restless hurricane has swept over them
and left only here and there a lonely trunk
despoiled of its verdure
shorn of its foliage
unshading and unshaded
to murmur in a few more gentle breezes
and to combat with its mutilated limbs a few more ruder storms
then to sink and be no more
they were pillars of the temple of liberty and now that they have crumbled away that temple must fall unless we
their descendants
supply their places with other pillars
hewn from the solid quarry of sober reason
passion has helped us
but can do so no more
it will in future be our enemy
unimpassioned reason must furnish all the materials for our future support and defence
let those materials be moulded into general intelligence
sound morality
in particular
a reverence for the constitution and laws and that we improved to the last
that we remained free to the last
that we revered his name to the last
that during his long sleep we permitted no hostile foot to pass over or desecrate his resting place
shall be that which to learn the last trump shall awaken our washington
upon these let the proud fabric of freedom rest
as the rock of its basis
as truly as has been said of the only greater institution
the gates of hell shall not prevail against it
speech
at springfield
june 16
1858 mr
and gentlemen of the convention
if we could first know where we are
and whither we are tending
we could better judge what to do
and how to do it
we are now far into the fifth year since a policy was initiated with the avowed object and confident promise of putting an end to slavery agitation
under the operation of that policy
that agitation has not only not ceased
but has constantly augmented
in my opinion
it will not cease
until a crisis shall have been reached and passed
a house divided against itself cannot stand
i believe this government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free
i do not expect the union to be dissolved i do not expect the house to fall but i do expect it will cease to be divided
it will become all one thing or all the other
either the opponents of slavery will arrest the further spread of it
and place it where the public mind shall rest in the belief that it is in the course of ultimate extinction or its advocates will push it forward
till it shall become alike lawful in all the states
old as well as new
north as well as south
have we no tendency to the latter condition
let any one who doubts carefully contemplate that now almost complete legal combination piece of machinery
so to speak compounded of the nebraska doctrine and the dred scott decision
let him consider not only what work the machinery is adapted to do
and how well adapted but also let him study the history of its construction
and trace
if he can
or rather fail
if he can
to trace the evidences of design and concert of action among its chief architects
from the beginning
the new year of 1854 found slavery excluded from more than half the states by state constitutions
and from most of the national territory by congressional prohibition
four days later commenced the struggle which ended in repealing that congressional prohibition
this opened all the national territory to slavery
and was the first point gained
so far
congress only had acted
and an indorsement by the people
real or apparent
was indispensable
to save the point already gained
and give chance for more
this necessity had not been overlooked
but had been provided for
as well as might be
in the notable argument of squatter sovereignty
otherwise called sacred right of self government
which latter phrase
though expressive of the only rightful basis of any government
was so perverted in this attempted use of it as to amount to just this
that if any one man choose to enslave another
no third man shall be allowed to object
that argument was incorporated into the nebraska bill itself
in the language which follows
it being the true intent and meaning of this act not to legislate slavery into any territory or state
nor to exclude it therefrom but to leave the people thereof perfectly free to form and regulate their domestic institutions in their own way
subject only to the constitution of the united states
then opened the roar of loose declamation in favor of squatter sovereignty and sacred right of self government
but
said opposition members
let us amend the bill so as to expressly declare that the people of the territory may exclude slavery
not we
said the friends of the measure and down they voted the amendment
while the nebraska bill was passing through congress
a law case involving the question of a negro's freedom
by reason of his owner having voluntarily taken him first into a free state and then into a territory covered by the congressional prohibition
and held him as a slave for a long time in each
was passing through the united states circuit court for the district of missouri and both nebraska bill and lawsuit were brought to a decision in the same month of may
the negro's name was dred scott
which name now designates the decision finally made in the case
before the then next presidential election
the law case came to and was argued in the supreme court of the united states but the decision of it was deferred until after the election
before the election
senator trumbull
on the floor of the senate
requested the leading advocate of the nebraska bill to state his opinion whether the people of a territory can constitutionally exclude slavery from their limits and the latter answers
that is a question for the supreme court
the election came
buchanan was elected
and the indorsement
such as it was
that was the second point gained
the indorsement
fell short of a clear popular majority by nearly four hundred thousand votes
and so
was not overwhelmingly reliable and satisfactory
the out going president
in his last annual message
as impressively as possible echoed back upon the people the weight and authority of the indorsement
the supreme court met again did not announce their decision
but ordered a reargument
the presidential inauguration came
and still no decision of the court but the incoming president in his inaugural address fervently exhorted the people to abide by the forthcoming decision
whatever it might be
in a few days
came the decision
the reputed author of the nebraska bill finds an early occasion to make a speech at this capital indorseing the dred scott decision
and vehemently denouncing all opposition to it
the new president
seizes the early occasion of the silliman letter to indorse and strongly construe that decision
and to express his astonishment that any different view had ever been entertained
at length a squabble springs up between the president and the author of the nebraska bill
on the mere question of fact
whether the lecompton constitution was or was not
in any just sense
made by the people of kansas and in that quarrel the latter declares that all he wants is a fair vote for the people
and that he cares not whether slavery be voted down or voted up
i do not understand his declaration that he cares not whether slavery be voted down or voted up to be intended by him other than as an apt definition of the policy he would impress upon the public mind the principle for which he declares he has suffered so much
and is ready to suffer to the end
and well may he cling to that principle
if he has any parental feeling
well may he cling to it
that principle is the only shred left of his original nebraska doctrine
under the dred scott decision squatter sovereignty squatted out of existence
tumbled down like temporary scaffolding like the mould at the foundry served through one blast and fell back into loose sand
helped to carry an election
and then was kicked to the winds
his late joint struggle with the republicans against the lecompton constitution involves nothing of the original nebraska doctrine
that struggle was made on a point the right of a people to make their own constitution upon which he and the republicans have never differed
the several points of the dred scott decision
in connection with senator douglas's care not policy
constitute the piece of machinery in its present state of advancement
this was the third point gained
the working points of that machinery are
1 that no negro slave
imported as such from africa
and no descendant of such slave
can ever be a citizen of any state
in the sense of that term as used in the constitution of the united states
this point is made in order to deprive the negro
in every possible event
of the benefit of that provision of the united states constitution which declares that the citizens of each state shall be entitled to all the privileges and immunities of citizens in the several states
2 that
subject to the constitution of the united states
neither congress nor a territorial legislature can exclude slavery from any united states territory
this point is made in order that individual men may fill up the territories with slaves
without danger of losing them as property
and thus to enhance the chances of permanency to the institution through all the future
3 that whether the holding a negro in actual slavery in a free state makes him free as against the holder
the united states courts will not decide
but will leave to be decided by the courts of any slave state the negro may be forced into by the master
this point is made
not to be pressed immediately but
if acquiesced in for a while
and apparently indorsed by the people at an election
then to sustain the logical conclusion that what dred scott's master might lawfully do with dred scott
in the free state of illinois
every other master may lawfully do with any other one
or one thousand slaves
in illinois
or in any other free state
auxiliary to all this
and working hand in hand with it
the nebraska doctrine
or what is left of it
is to educate and mould public opinion
at least northern public opinion
not to care whether slavery is voted down or voted up
this shows exactly where we now are and partially
whither we are tending
it will throw additional light on the latter
to go back and run the mind over the string of historical facts already stated
several things will now appear less dark and mysterious than they did when they were transpiring
the people were to be left perfectly free
subject only to the constitution
what the constitution had to do with it outsiders could not then see
plainly enough now
it was an exactly fitted niche for the dred scott decision to afterward come in
and declare the perfect freedom of the people to be just no freedom at all
why was the amendment
expressly declaring the right of the people
voted down
plainly enough now
the adoption of it would have spoiled the niche for the dred scott decision
why was the court decision held up
why even a senator's individual opinion withheld till after the presidential election
plainly enough now
the speaking out then would have damaged the perfectly free argument upon which the election was to be carried
why the outgoing president's felicitation on the indorsement
why the delay of a reargument
why the incoming president's advance exhortation in favor of the decision
these things look like the cautious patting and petting of a spirited horse preparatory to mounting him
when it is dreaded that he may give the rider a fall
and why the hasty after indorsement of the decision by the president and others
we cannot absolutely know that all these exact adaptations are the result of preconcert
but when we see a lot of framed timbers
different portions of which we know have been gotten out at different times and places and by different workmen
and james
for instance and we see these timbers joined together
and see they exactly make the frame of a house or a mill
all the tenons and mortices exactly fitting
and all the lengths and proportions of the different pieces exactly adapted to their respective places
and not a piece too many or too few
not omitting even scaffolding or
if a single piece be lacking
we see the place in the frame exactly fitted and prepared yet to bring such piece in in such a case we find it impossible not to believe that stephen and franklin and roger and james all understood one another from the beginning
and all worked upon a common plan or draft drawn up before the first blow was struck
it should not be overlooked that
by the nebraska bill
the people of a state as well as territory were to be left perfectly free
subject only to the constitution
why mention a state
they were legislating for territories
and not for or about states
certainly the people of a state are and ought to be subject to the constitution of the united states but why is mention of this lugged into this merely territorial law
why are the people of a territory and the people of a state therein lumped together
and their relation to the constitution therein treated as being precisely the same
while the opinion of the court
by chief justice taney
in the dred scott case
and the separate opinions of all the concurring judges
expressly declare that the constitution of the united states neither permits congress nor a territorial legislature to exclude slavery from any united states territory
they all omit to declare whether or not the same constitution permits a state
or the people of a state
to exclude it
this is a mere omission but who can be quite sure
if mclean or curtis had sought to get into the opinion a declaration of unlimited power in the people of a state to exclude slavery from their limits
just as chase and mace sought to get such declaration
in behalf of the people of a territory
into the nebraska bill i ask
who can be quite sure that it would not have been voted down in the one case as it had been in the other
the nearest approach to the point of declaring the power of a state over slavery is made by judge nelson
he approaches it more than once
using the precise idea
and almost the language too
of the nebraska act
on one occasion his exact language is
except in cases where the power is restrained by the constitution of the united states
the law of the state is supreme over the subject of slavery within its jurisdiction
in what cases the power of the states is so restrained by the united states constitution is left an open question
precisely as the same question as to the restraint on the power of the territories was left open in the nebraska act
put this and that together
and we have another nice little niche
which we may
ere long
see filled with another supreme court decision declaring that the constitution of the united states does not permit a state to exclude slavery from its limits
and this may especially be expected if the doctrine of care not whether slavery be voted down or voted up shall gain upon the public mind sufficiently to give promise that such a decision can be maintained when made
such a decision is all that slavery now lacks of being alike lawful in all the states
or unwelcome
such decision is probably coming
and will soon be upon us
unless the power of the present political dynasty shall be met and overthrown
we shall lie down pleasantly dreaming that the people of missouri are on the verge of making their state free
and we shall awake to the reality instead that the supreme court has made illinois a slave state
to meet and overthrow the power of that dynasty is the work now before all those who would prevent that consummation
that is what we have to do
how can we best do it
there are those who denounce us openly to their own friends
and yet whisper us softly that senator douglas is the aptest instrument there is with which to effect that object
they wish us to infer all from the fact that he now has a little quarrel with the present head of the dynasty and that he has regularly voted with us on a single point
upon which he and we have never differed
they remind us that he is a great man
and that the largest of us are very small ones
let this be granted
but a living dog is better than a dead lion
judge douglas
if not a dead lion for this work
is at least a caged and toothless one
how can he oppose the advances of slavery
he don't care anything about it
his avowed mission is impressing the public heart to care nothing about it
a leading douglas democratic newspaper thinks douglas's superior talent will be needed to resist the revival of the african slave trade
does douglas believe an effort to revive that trade is approaching
he has not said so
does he really think so
but if it is
how can he resist it
for years he has labored to prove it a sacred right of white men to take negro slaves into the new territories
can he possibly show that it is less a sacred right to buy them where they can be bought cheapest
and unquestionably they can be bought cheaper in africa than in virginia
he has done all in his power to reduce the whole question of slavery to one of a mere right of property and
as such
how can he oppose the foreign slave trade how can he refuse that trade in that property shall be perfectly free unless he does it as a protection to the home production
and as the home producers will probably not ask the protection
he will be wholly without a ground of opposition
senator douglas holds
we know
that a man may rightfully be wiser to day than he was yesterday that he may rightfully change when he finds himself wrong
but can we
for that reason
run ahead
and infer that he will make any particular change
of which he himself has given no intimation
can we safely base our action upon any such vague inference
as ever
i wish not to misrepresent judge douglas's position
question his motives
or do aught that can be personally offensive to him
if ever
he and we can come together on principle so that our great cause may have assistance from his great ability
i hope to have interposed no adventitious obstacle
but clearly he is not now with us he does not pretend to be he does not promise ever to be
our cause
must be intrusted to
and conducted by
its own undoubted friends those whose hands are free
whose hearts are in the work
who do care for the result
two years ago the republicans of the nation mustered over thirteen hundred thousand strong
we did this under the single impulse of resistance to a common danger
with every external circumstance against us
of strange
and even hostile elements
we gathered from the four winds
and formed and fought the battle through
under the constant hot fire of a disciplined
and pampered enemy
did we brave all then to falter now
when that same enemy is wavering
and belligerent
the result is not doubtful
we shall not fail if we stand firm
we shall not fail
wise counsels may accelerate or mistakes delay it
sooner or later
the victory is sure to come
second joint debate at freeport
august 27
1858 ladies and gentlemen on saturday last
judge douglas and myself first met in public discussion
he spoke one hour
i an hour and a half
and he replied for half an hour
the order is now reversed
i am to speak an hour
he an hour and a half
and then i am to reply for half an hour
i propose to devote myself during the first hour to the scope of what was brought within the range of his half hour speech at ottawa
of course
there was brought within the scope of that half hour's speech something of his own opening speech
in the course of that opening argument judge douglas proposed to me seven distinct interrogatories
in my speech of an hour and a half
i attended to some other parts of his speech
and incidentally
as i thought
answered one of the interrogatories then
i then distinctly intimated to him that i would answer the rest of his interrogatories on condition only that he should agree to answer as many for me
he made no intimation at the time of the proposition
nor did he in his reply allude at all to that suggestion of mine
i do him no injustice in saying that he occupied at least half of his reply in dealing with me as though i had refused to answer his interrogatories
i now propose that i will answer any of the interrogatories
upon condition that he will answer questions from me not exceeding the same number
i give him an opportunity to respond
the judge remains silent
i now say that i will answer his interrogatories
whether he answers mine or not and that after i have done so
i shall propound mine to him
i have supposed myself
since the organization of the republican party at bloomington
in may
bound as a party man by the platforms of the party
then and since
if in any interrogatories which i shall answer i go beyond the scope of what is within these platforms
it will be perceived that no one is responsible but myself
having said thus much
i will take up the judge's interrogatories as i find them printed in the chicago times
and answer them seriatim
in order that there may be no mistake about it
i have copied the interrogatories in writing
and also my answers to them
the first one of these interrogatories is in these words
question 1
i desire to know whether lincoln today stands as he did in 1854
in favor of the unconditional repeal of the fugitive slave law
answer
i do not now
nor ever did
stand in favor of the unconditional repeal of the fugitive slave law
i desire him to answer whether he stands pledged to day as he did in 1854
against the admission of any more slave states into the union
even if the people want them
a
i do not now
nor ever did
stand pledged against the admission of any more slave states into the union
i want to know whether he stands pledged against the admission of a new state into the union with such a constitution as the people of that state may see fit to make
a
i do not stand pledged against the admission of a new state into the union with such a constitution as the people of that state may see fit to make
i want to know whether he stands to day pledged to the abolition of slavery in the district of columbia
a
i do not stand to day pledged to the abolition of slavery in the district of columbia
i desire him to answer whether he stands pledged to the prohibition of the slave trade between the different states
a
i do not stand pledged to the prohibition of the slave trade between the different states
i desire to know whether he stands pledged to prohibit slavery in all the territories of the united states
north as well as south of the missouri compromise line
a
i am impliedly
if not expressly
pledged to a belief in the right and duty of congress to prohibit slavery in all the united states territories
i desire him to answer whether he is opposed to the acquisition of any new territory unless slavery is first prohibited therein
a
i am not generally opposed to honest acquisition of territory and
in any given case
i would or would not oppose such acquisition
accordingly as i might think such acquisition would or would not aggravate the slavery question among ourselves
my friends
it will be perceived upon an examination of these questions and answers
that so far i have only answered that i was not pledged to this
or the other
the judge has not framed his interrogatories to ask me anything more than this
and i have answered in strict accordance with the interrogatories
and have answered truly that i am not pledged at all upon any of the points to which i have answered
but i am not disposed to hang upon the exact form of his interrogatory
i am really disposed to take up at least some of these questions
and state what i really think upon them
as to the first one
in regard to the fugitive slave law
i have never hesitated to say
and i do not now hesitate to say
that i think
under the constitution of the united states
the people of the southern states are entitled to a congressional fugitive slave law
having said that
i have had nothing to say in regard to the existing fugitive slave law
further than that i think it should have been framed so as to be free from some of the objections that pertain to it
without lessening its efficiency
and inasmuch as we are now not in an agitation in regard to an alteration or modification of that law
i would not be the man to introduce it as a new subject of agitation upon the general question of slavery
in regard to the other question
of whether i am pledged to the admission of any more slave states into the union
i state to you very frankly that i would be exceedingly sorry ever to be put in a position of having to pass upon that question
i should be exceedingly glad to know that there would never be another slave state admitted into the union but i must add
that if slavery shall be kept out of the territories during the territorial existence of any one given territory
and then the people shall
having a fair chance and a clear field
when they come to adopt the constitution
do such an extraordinary thing as to adopt a slave constitution
uninfluenced by the actual presence of the institution among them
i see no alternative
if we own the country
but to admit them into the union
the third interrogatory is answered by the answer to the second
it being
as i conceive
the same as the second
the fourth one is in regard to the abolition of slavery in the district of columbia
in relation to that
i have my mind very distinctly made up
i should be exceedingly glad to see slavery abolished in the district of columbia
i believe that congress possesses the constitutional power to abolish it
as a member of congress
i should not
with my present views
be in favor of endeavoring to abolish slavery in the district of columbia
unless it would be upon these conditions first
that the abolition should be gradual second
that it should be on a vote of the majority of qualified voters in the district and third
that compensation should be made to unwilling owners
with these three conditions
i confess i would be exceedingly glad to see congress abolish slavery in the district of columbia
in the language of henry clay
sweep from our capital that foul blot upon our nation
in regard to the fifth interrogatory
i must say here that as to the question of the abolition of the slave trade between the different states
i can truly answer
as i have
that i am pledged to nothing about it
it is a subject to which i have not given that mature consideration that would make me feel authorized to state a position so as to hold myself entirely bound by it
in other words
that question has never been prominently enough before me to induce me to investigate whether we really have the constitutional power to do it
i could investigate it if i had sufficient time to bring myself to a conclusion upon that subject
but i have not done so
and i say so frankly to you here and to judge douglas
i must say
that if i should be of opinion that congress does possess the constitutional power to abolish the slave trade among the different states
i should still not be in favor of the exercise of that power unless upon some conservative principle
as i conceive it
akin to what i have said in relation to the abolition of slavery in the district of columbia
my answer as to whether i desire that slavery should be prohibited in all the territories of the united states is full and explicit within itself
and cannot be made clearer by any comments of mine
so i suppose in regard to the question whether i am opposed to the acquisition of any more territory unless slavery is first prohibited therein
my answer is such that i could add nothing by way of illustration
or making myself better understood
than the answer which i have placed in writing
now in all this the judge has me
and he has me on the record
i suppose he had flattered himself that i was really entertaining one set of opinions for one place and another set for another place that i was afraid to say at one place what i uttered at another
what i am saying here i suppose i say to a vast audience as strongly tending to abolitionism as any audience in the state of illinois
and i believe i am saying that which
if it would be offensive to any persons and render them enemies to myself
would be offensive to persons in this audience
i now proceed to propound to the judge the interrogatories
so far as i have framed them
i will bring forward a new instalment when i get them ready
i will bring them forward now
only reaching to number four
the first one is
question 1
if the people of kansas shall
by means entirely unobjectionable in all other respects
adopt a state constitution
and ask admission into the union under it
before they have the requisite number of inhabitants according to the english bill
some ninety three thousand
will you vote to admit them
can the people of a united states territory
in any lawful way
against the wish of any citizen of the united states
exclude slavery from its limits prior to the formation of a state constitution
if the supreme court of the united states shall decide that states cannot exclude slavery from their limits
are you in favor of acquiescing in
and following such decision as a rule of political action
are you in favor of acquiring additional territory
in disregard of how such acquisition may affect the nation on the slavery question
as introductory to these interrogatories which judge douglas propounded to me at ottawa
he read a set of resolutions which he said judge trumbull and myself had participated in adopting
in the first republican state convention
held at springfield
in october
he insisted that i and judge trumbull
and perhaps the entire republican party
were responsible for the doctrines contained in the set of resolutions which he read
and i understand that it was from that set of resolutions that he deduced the interrogatories which he propounded to me
using these resolutions as a sort of authority for propounding those questions to me
now i say here to day that i do not answer his interrogatories because of their springing at all from that set of resolutions which he read
i answered them because judge douglas thought fit to ask them
i do not now
nor ever did
recognize any responsibility upon myself in that set of resolutions
when i replied to him on that occasion
i assured him that i never had anything to do with them
i repeat here to day
that i never in any possible form had anything to do with that set of resolutions
it turns out
i believe
that those resolutions were never passed at any convention held in springfield
it turns out that they were never passed at any convention or any public meeting that i had any part in
i believe it turns out
in addition to all this
that there was not
in the fall of 1854
any convention holding a session in springfield calling itself a republican state convention yet it is true there was a convention
or assemblage of men calling themselves a convention
at springfield
that did pass some resolutions
but so little did i really know of the proceedings of that convention
or what set of resolutions they had passed
though having a general knowledge that there had been such an assemblage of men there
that when judge douglas read the resolutions
i really did not know but that they had been the resolutions passed then and there
i did not question that they were the resolutions adopted
for i could not bring myself to suppose that judge douglas could say what he did upon this subject without knowing that it was true
i contented myself
on that occasion
with denying
as i truly could
all connection with them
not denying or affirming whether they were passed at springfield
now it turns out that he had got hold of some resolutions passed at some convention or public meeting in kane county
i wish to say here
that i don't conceive that in any fair and just mind this discovery relieves me at all
i had just as much to do with the convention in kane county as that at springfield
i am just as much responsible for the resolutions at kane county as those at springfield
the amount of the responsibility being exactly nothing in either case no more than there would be in regard to a set of resolutions passed in the moon
i allude to this extraordinary matter in this canvass for some further purpose than anything yet advanced
judge douglas did not make his statement upon that occasion as matters that he believed to be true
but he stated them roundly as being true
in such form as to pledge his veracity for their truth
when the whole matter turns out as it does
and when we consider who judge douglas is
that he is a distinguished senator of the united states that he has served nearly twelve years as such that his character is not at all limited as an ordinary senator of the united states
but that his name has become of world wide renown
it is most extraordinary that he should so far forget all the suggestions of justice to an adversary
or of prudence to himself
as to venture upon the assertion of that which the slightest investigation would have shown him to be wholly false
i can only account for his having done so upon the supposition that that evil genius which has attended him through his life
giving to him an apparent astonishing prosperity
such as to lead very many good men to doubt there being any advantage in virtue over vice i say i can only account for it on the supposition that that evil genius has at last made up its mind to forsake him
and i may add that another extraordinary feature of the judge's conduct in this canvass made more extraordinary by this incident is
that he is in the habit
in almost all the speeches he makes
of charging falsehood upon his adversaries
myself and others
i now ask whether he is able to find in anything that judge trumbull
for instance
has said
or in anything that i have said
a justification at all compared with what we have
in this instance
for that sort of vulgarity
i have been in the habit of charging as a matter of belief on my part
in the introduction of the nebraska bill into congress
there was a conspiracy to make slavery perpetual and national
i have arranged from time to time the evidence which establishes and proves the truth of this charge
i recurred to this charge at ottawa
i shall not now have time to dwell upon it at very great length but
inasmuch as judge douglas in his reply of half an hour made some points upon me in relation to it
i propose noticing a few of them
the judge insists that
in the first speech i made
in which i very distinctly made that charge
he thought for a good while i was in fun
that i was playful that i was not sincere about it and that he only grew angry and somewhat excited when he found that i insisted upon it as a matter of earnestness
he says he characterized it as a falsehood as far as i implicated his moral character in that transaction
i did not know
till he presented that view
that i had implicated his moral character
he is very much in the habit
when he argues me up into a position i never thought of occupying
of very cozily saying he has no doubt lincoln is conscientious in saying so
he should remember that i did not know but what he was altogether conscientious in that matter
i can conceive it possible for men to conspire to do a good thing
and i really find nothing in judge douglas's course of arguments that is contrary to or inconsistent with his belief of a conspiracy to nationalize and spread slavery as being a good and blessed thing
and so i hope he will understand that i do not at all question but that in all this matter he is entirely conscientious
but to draw your attention to one of the points i made in this case
beginning at the beginning
when the nebraska bill was introduced
or a short time afterward
by an amendment
i believe
it was provided that it must be considered the true intent and meaning of this act not to legislate slavery into any state or territory
or to exclude it therefrom
but to leave the people thereof perfectly free to form and regulate their own domestic institutions in their own way subject only to the constitution of the united states
i have called his attention to the fact that when he and some others began arguing that they were giving an increased degree of liberty to the people in the territories over and above what they formerly had on the question of slavery
a question was raised whether the law was enacted to give such unconditional liberty to the people and to test the sincerity of this mode of argument
of ohio
introduced an amendment
in which he made the law if the amendment were adopted expressly declare that the people of the territory should have the power to exclude slavery if they saw fit
i have asked attention also to the fact that judge douglas
and those who acted with him
voted that amendment down
notwithstanding it expressed exactly the thing they said was the true intent and meaning of the law
i have called attention to the fact that in subsequent times a decision of the supreme court has been made in which it has been declared that a territorial legislature has no constitutional right to exclude slavery
and i have argued and said that for men who did intend that the people of the territory should have the right to exclude slavery absolutely and unconditionally
the voting down of chase's amendment is wholly inexplicable
it is a puzzle a riddle
but i have said that with men who did look forward to such a decision
or who had it in contemplation
that such a decision of the supreme court would or might be made
the voting down of that amendment would be perfectly rational and intelligible
it would keep congress from coming in collision with the decision when it was made
anybody can conceive that if there was an intention or expectation that such a decision was to follow
it would not be a very desirable party attitude to get into for the supreme court all or nearly all its members belonging to the same party to decide one way
when the party in congress had decided the other way
hence it would be very rational for men expecting such a decision to keep the niche in that law clear for it
after pointing this out
i tell judge douglas that it looks to me as though here was the reason why chase's amendment was voted down
i tell him that as he did it
and knows why he did it
if it was done for a reason different from this
he knows what that reason was
and can tell us what it was
i tell him
it will be vastly more satisfactory to the country for him to give some other plausible
intelligible reason why it was voted down than to stand upon his dignity and call people liars
on saturday he did make his answer
and what do you think it was
he says if i had only taken upon myself to tell the whole truth about that amendment of chase's
no explanation would have been necessary on his part or words to that effect
i say here that i am quite unconscious of having suppressed anything material to the case
and i am very frank to admit if there is any sound reason other than that which appeared to me material
it is quite fair for him to present it
what reason does he propose
that when chase came forward with his amendment expressly authorizing the people to exclude slavery from the limits of every territory
general cass proposed to chase
if he chase would add to his amendment that the people should have the power to introduce or exclude
they would let it go
this is substantially all of his reply
and because chase would not do that they voted his amendment down
it turns out
i believe
upon examination
that general cass took some part in the little running debate upon that amendment
and then ran away and did not vote on it at all
is not that the fact
so confident
as i think
was general cass that there was a snake somewhere about
he chose to run away from the whole thing
this is an inference i draw from the fact that
though he took part in the debate
his name does not appear in the ayes and noes
but does judge douglas's reply amount to a satisfactory answer
cries of yes
yes
and no
no
there is some little difference of opinion here
but i ask attention to a few more views bearing on the question of whether it amounts to a satisfactory answer
the men who were determined that that amendment should not get into the bill
and spoil the place where the dred scott decision was to come in
sought an excuse to get rid of it somewhere
one of these ways one of these excuses was to ask chase to add to his proposed amendment a provision that the people might introduce slavery if they wanted to
they very well knew chase would do no such thing that mr
chase was one of the men differing from them on the broad principle of his insisting that freedom was better than slavery a man who would not consent to enact a law
penned with his own hand
by which he was made to recognize slavery on the one hand and liberty on the other as precisely equal and when they insisted on his doing this
they very well knew they insisted on that which he would not for a moment think of doing
and that they were only bluffing him
i believe i have not
since he made his answer
had a chance to examine the journals or congressional globe
and therefore speak from memory i believe the state of the bill at that time
according to parliamentary rules
was such that no member could propose an additional amendment to chase's amendment
i rather think this the truth the judge shakes his head
very well
i would
like to know then
if they wanted chase's amendment fixed over
why somebody else could not have offered to do it
if they wanted it amended
why did they not offer the amendment
why did they stand there taunting and quibbling at chase
why did they not put it in themselves
to put it on the other ground
suppose that there was such an amendment offered and chase's was an amendment to an amendment until one is disposed of by parliamentary law
you cannot pile another on
then all these gentlemen had to do was to vote chase's on
and then
in the amended form in which the whole stood
add their own amendment to it if they wanted to put it in that shape
this was all they were obliged to do
and the ayes and noes show that there were thirty six who voted it down
against ten who voted in favor of it
the thirty six held entire sway and control
they could in some form or other have put that bill in the exact shape they wanted
if there was a rule preventing their amending it at the time
they could pass that
and then
chase's amendment being merged
put it in the shape they wanted
they did not choose to do so
but they went into a quibble with chase to get him to add what they knew he would not add
and because he would not
they stand upon that flimsy pretext for voting down what they argued was the meaning and intent of their own bill
they left room thereby for this dred scott decision
which goes very far to make slavery national throughout the united states
i pass one or two points i have because my time will very soon expire
but i must be allowed to say that judge douglas recurs again
as he did upon one of two other occasions
to the enormity of lincoln an insignificant individual like lincoln upon his ipse dixit charging a conspiracy upon a large number of members of congress
the supreme court
and two presidents
to nationalize slavery
i want to say that
in the first place
i have made no charge of this sort upon my ipse dixit
i have only arrayed the evidence tending to prove it
and presented it to the understanding of others
saying what i think it proves
but giving you the means of judging whether it proves it or not
this is precisely what i have done
i have not placed it upon my ipse dixit at all
on this occasion
i wish to recall his attention to a piece of evidence which i brought forward at ottawa on saturday
showing that he had made substantially the same charge against substantially the same persons
excluding his dear self from the category
i ask him to give some attention to the evidence which i brought forward
that he himself had discovered a fatal blow being struck against the right of the people to exclude slavery from their limits
which fatal blow he assumed as in evidence in an article in the washington union
published by authority
i ask by whose authority
he discovers a similar or identical provision in the lecompton constitution
made by whom
the framers of that constitution
advocated by whom
by all the members of the party in the nation who advocated the introduction of kansas into the union under the lecompton constitution
i have asked his attention to the evidence that he arrayed to prove that such a fatal blow was being struck
and to the facts which he brought forward in support of that charge being identical with the one which he thinks so villainous in me
he pointed it not at a newspaper editor merely
but at the president and his cabinet
and the members of congress advocating the lecompton constitution
and those framing that instrument
i must again be permitted to remind him
that although my ipse dixit may not be as great as his
yet it somewhat reduces the force of his calling my attention to the enormity of my making a like charge against him
go on
judge douglas
the cooper institute address
february 27
1860 mr
president and fellow citizens of new york
the facts with which i shall deal this evening are mainly old and familiar nor is there anything new in the general use i shall make of them
if there shall be any novelty
it will be in the mode of presenting the facts
and the inferences and observations following that presentation
in his speech last autumn
at columbus
as reported in the new york times
senator douglas said
our fathers
when they framed the government under which we live
understood this question just as well
and even better
than we do now
i fully indorse this
and i adopt it as a text for this discourse
i so adopt it because it furnishes a precise and agreed starting point for a discussion between republicans and that wing of the democracy headed by senator douglas
it simply leaves the inquiry
what was the understanding those fathers had of the question mentioned
what is the frame of government under which we live
the answer must be
the constitution of the united states
that constitution consists of the original
framed in 1787 and under which the present government first went into operation
and twelve subsequently framed amendments
the first ten of which were framed in 1789
who were our fathers that framed the constitution
i suppose the thirty nine who signed the original instrument may be fairly called our fathers who framed that part of the present government
it is almost exactly true to say they framed it
and it is altogether true to say they fairly represented the opinion and sentiment of the whole nation at that time
their names
being familiar to nearly all
and accessible to quite all
need not now be repeated
i take these thirty nine
for the present
as being our fathers who framed the government under which we live
what is the question which
according to the text
those fathers understood just as well
and even better
than we do now
it is this
does the proper division of local from federal authority
or anything in the constitution
forbid our federal government to control as to slavery in our federal territories
upon this
senator douglas holds the affirmative
and republicans the negative
this affirmation and denial form an issue and this issue this question is precisely what the text declares our fathers understood better than we
let us now
inquire whether the thirty nine
or any of them
ever acted upon this question and if they did
how they acted upon it how they expressed that better understanding
in 1784
three years before the constitution
the united states then owning the northwestern territory
and no other
the congress of the confederation had before them the question of prohibiting slavery in that territory and four of the thirty nine who afterward framed the constitution were in that congress
and voted on that question
of these
roger sherman
thomas mifflin
and hugh williamson voted for the prohibition
thus showing that
in their understanding
no line dividing local from federal authority
nor anything else
properly forbade the federal government to control as to slavery in federal territory
the other of the four james mchenry voted against the prohibition
showing that for some cause he thought it improper to vote for it
in 1787
still before the constitution
but while the convention was in session framing it
and while the northwestern territory still was the only territory owned by the united states
the same question of prohibiting slavery in the territory again came before the congress of the confederation and three more of the thirty nine who afterward signed the constitution were in that congress
and voted on the question
they were william blount
william few
and abraham baldwin and they all voted for the prohibition thus showing that
in their understanding
no line dividing local from federal authority
nor anything else
properly forbade the federal government to control as to slavery in federal territory
this time the prohibition became a law
being part of what is now well known as the ordinance of '87
the question of federal control of slavery in the territories seems not to have been directly before the convention which framed the original constitution and hence it is not recorded that the thirty nine
or any of them
while engaged on that instrument
expressed any opinion on that precise question
in 1789
by the first congress which sat under the constitution
an act was passed to enforce the ordinance of '87
including the prohibition of slavery in the northwestern territory
the bill for this act was reported by one of the thirty nine
thomas fitzsimmons
then a member of the house of representatives from pennsylvania
it went through all its stages without a word of opposition
and finally passed both branches without ayes and nays
which is equivalent to an unanimous passage
in this congress there were sixteen of the thirty nine fathers who framed the original constitution
they were john langdon
nicholas gilman
roger sherman
robert morris
william few
abraham baldwin
rufus king
william patterson
george clymer
richard bassett
george read
pierce butler
daniel carroll
and james madison
this shows that
in their understanding
no line dividing local from federal authority
nor anything in the constitution
properly forbade congress to prohibit slavery in the federal territory else both their fidelity to correct principle
and their oath to support the constitution
would have constrained them to oppose the prohibition
george washington
another of the thirty nine
was then president of the united states
and as such
approved and signed the bill
thus completing its validity as a law
and thus showing that
in his understanding
no line dividing local from federal authority
nor anything in the constitution
forbade the federal government to control as to slavery in federal territory
no great while after the adoption of the original constitution
north carolina ceded to the federal government the country now constituting the state of tennessee and a few years later georgia ceded that which now constitutes the states of mississippi and alabama
in both deeds of cession it was made a condition by the ceding states that the federal government should not prohibit slavery in the ceded country
besides this
slavery was then actually in the ceded country
under these circumstances
on taking charge of these countries
did not absolutely prohibit slavery within them
but they did interfere with it take control of it even there
to a certain extent
in 1798
congress organized the territory of mississippi
in the act of organization they prohibited the bringing of slaves into the territory from any place without the united states
by fine
and giving freedom to slaves so brought
this act passed both branches of congress without yeas and nays
in that congress were three of the thirty nine who framed the original constitution
they were john langdon
george read
and abraham baldwin
they all probably voted for it
certainly they would have placed their opposition to it upon record if
in their understanding
any line dividing local from federal authority
or anything in the constitution
properly forbade the federal government to control as to slavery in federal territory
in 1803
the federal government purchased the louisiana country
our former territorial acquisitions came from certain of our own states but this louisiana country was acquired from a foreign nation
in 1804
congress gave a territorial organization to that part of it which now constitutes the state of louisiana
new orleans
lying within that part
was an old and comparatively large city
there were other considerable towns and settlements
and slavery was extensively and thoroughly intermingled with the people
congress did not
in the territorial act
prohibit slavery but they did interfere with it take control of it in a more marked and extensive way than they did in the case of mississippi
the substance of the provision therein made in relation to slaves was
that no slave should be imported into the territory from foreign parts
that no slave should be carried into it who had been imported into the united states since the first day of may
that no slave should be carried into it
except by the owner
and for his own use as a settler the penalty in all the cases being a fine upon the violator of the law
and freedom to the slave
this act also was passed without ayes and nays
in the congress which passed it there were two of the thirty nine
they were abraham baldwin and jonathan dayton
as stated in the case of mississippi
it is probable they both voted for it
they would not have allowed it to pass without recording their opposition to it if
in their understanding
it violated either the line properly dividing local from federal authority
or any provision of the constitution
in 1819 20 came and passed the missouri question
many votes were taken
by yeas and nays
in both branches of congress
upon the various phases of the general question
two of the thirty nine rufus king and charles pinckney were members of that congress
king steadily voted for slavery prohibition and against all compromises
while mr
pinckney as steadily voted against slavery prohibition and against all compromises
by this
king showed that
in his understanding
no line dividing local from federal authority
nor anything in the constitution
was violated by congress prohibiting slavery in federal territory while mr
by his votes
showed that
in his understanding
there was some sufficient reason for opposing such prohibition in that case
the cases i have mentioned are the only acts of the thirty nine
or of any of them
upon the direct issue
which i have been able to discover
to enumerate the persons who thus acted as being four in 1784
three in 1787
seventeen in 1789
three in 1798
two in 1804
and two in 1819 20
there would be thirty of them
but this would be counting john langdon
roger sherman
william few
rufus king
and george read each twice
and abraham baldwin three times
the true number of those of the thirty nine whom i have shown to have acted upon the question which
by the text
they understood better than we
is twenty three
leaving sixteen not shown to have acted upon it in any way
we have twenty three out of our thirty nine fathers who framed the government under which we live
who have
upon their official responsibility and their corporal oaths
acted upon the very question which the text affirms they understood just as well
and even better
than we do now and twenty one of them a clear majority of the whole thirty nine so acting upon it as to make them guilty of gross political impropriety and wilful perjury if
in their understanding
any proper division between local and federal authority
or anything in the constitution they had made themselves
and sworn to support
forbade the federal government to control as to slavery in the federal territories
thus the twenty one acted and
as actions speak louder than words
so actions under such responsibility speak still louder
two of the twenty three voted against congressional prohibition of slavery in the federal territories
in the instances in which they acted upon the question
but for what reasons they so voted is not known
they may have done so because they thought a proper division of local from federal authority
or some provision or principle of the constitution
stood in the way or they may
without any such question
have voted against the prohibition on what appeared to them to be sufficient grounds of expediency
no one who has sworn to support the constitution can conscientiously vote for what he understands to be an unconstitutional measure
however expedient he may think it but one may and ought to vote against a measure which he deems constitutional if
at the same time
he deems it inexpedient
would be unsafe to set down even the two who voted against the prohibition as having done so because
in their understanding
any proper division of local from federal authority
or anything in the constitution
forbade the federal government to control as to slavery in federal territory
the remaining sixteen of the thirty nine
so far as i have discovered
have left no record of their understanding upon the direct question of federal control of slavery in the federal territories
but there is much reason to believe that their understanding upon that question would not have appeared different from that of their twenty three compeers
had it been manifested at all
for the purpose of adhering rigidly to the text
i have purposely omitted whatever understanding may have been manifested by any person
however distinguished
other than the thirty nine fathers who framed the original constitution and
for the same reason
i have also omitted whatever understanding may have been manifested by any of the thirty nine even on any other phase of the general question of slavery
if we should look into their acts and declarations on those other phases
as the foreign slave trade
and the morality and policy of slavery generally
it would appear to us that on the direct question of federal control of slavery in federal territories
the sixteen
if they had acted at all
would probably have acted just as the twenty three did
among that sixteen were several of the most noted anti slavery men of those times
as dr
alexander hamilton
and gouverneur morris
while there was not one now known to have been otherwise
unless it may be john rutledge
of south carolina
the sum of the whole is that of our thirty nine fathers who framed the original constitution
twenty one a clear majority of the whole certainly understood that no proper division of local from federal authority
nor any part of the constitution
forbade the federal government to control slavery in the federal territories while all the rest probably had the same understanding
was the understanding of our fathers who framed the original constitution and the text affirms that they understood the question better than we
but
so far
i have been considering the understanding of the question manifested by the framers of the original constitution
in and by the original instrument
a mode was provided for amending it and
as i have already stated
the present frame of the government under which we live consists of that original
and twelve amendatory articles framed and adopted since
those who now insist that federal control of slavery in federal territories violates the constitution
point us to the provisions which they suppose it thus violates and
i understand
they all fix upon provisions in these amendatory articles
and not in the original instrument
the supreme court
in the dred scott case
plant themselves upon the fifth amendment
which provides that no person shall be deprived of life
or property without due process of law while senator douglas and his peculiar adherents plant themselves upon the tenth amendment
providing that the powers not delegated to the united states by the constitution are reserved to the states respectively
or to the people
now
it so happens that these amendments were framed by the first congress which sat under the constitution the identical congress which passed the act already mentioned
enforcing the prohibition of slavery in the northwestern territory
not only was it the same congress
but they were the identical
same individual men who
at the same session
and at the same time within the session
had under consideration
and in progress toward maturity
these constitutional amendments
and this act prohibiting slavery in all the territory the nation then owned
the constitutional amendments were introduced before
and passed after
the act enforcing the ordinance of '87 so that
during the whole pendency of the act to enforce the ordinance
the constitutional amendments were also pending
that congress
consisting in all of seventy six members
including sixteen of the framers of the original constitution
as before stated
were preeminently our fathers who framed that part of the government under which we live
which is now claimed as forbidding the federal government to control slavery in the federal territories
is it not a little presumptuous in any one at this day to affirm that the two things which that congress deliberately framed
and carried to maturity at the same time
are absolutely inconsistent with each other
and does not such affirmation become impudently absurd when coupled with the other affirmation
from the same mouth
that those who did the two things
alleged to be inconsistent
understood whether they really were inconsistent better than we better than he who affirms that they are inconsistent
it is surely safe to assume that the thirty nine framers of the original constitution
and the seventy six members of the congress which framed the amendments thereto
taken together
do certainly include those who may be fairly called our fathers who framed the government under which we live
and so assuming
i defy any man to show that any one of them ever
in his whole life
declared that
in his understanding
any proper division of local from federal authority
or any part of the constitution
forbade the federal government to control as to slavery in the federal territories
i go a step further
i defy any one to show that any living man
in the whole world ever did
prior to the beginning of the present century and i might almost say prior to the beginning of the last half of the present century
declare that
in his understanding
any proper division of local from federal authority
or any part of the constitution
forbade the federal government to control as to slavery in the federal territories
to those who now so declare i give not only our fathers who framed the government under which we live
but with them all other living men within the century in which it was framed
among whom to search
and they shall not be able to find the evidence of a single man agreeing with them
and here let me guard a little against being misunderstood
i do not mean to say we are bound to follow implicitly in whatever our fathers did
to do so would be to discard all the lights of current experience to reject all progress
all improvement
what i do say is
that if we would supplant the opinions and policy of our fathers in any case
we should do so upon evidence so conclusive
and argument so clear
that even their great authority
fairly considered and weighed
cannot stand and most surely not in a case whereof we ourselves declare they understood the question better than we
if any man at this day sincerely believes that a proper division of local from federal authority
or any part of the constitution
forbids the federal government to control as to slavery in the federal territories
he is right to say so
and to enforce his position by all truthful evidence and fair argument which he can
but he has no right to mislead others
who have less access to history
and less leisure to study it
into the false belief that our fathers who framed the government under which we live were of the same opinion thus substituting falsehood and deception for truthful evidence and fair argument
if any man at this day sincerely believes our fathers who framed the government under which we live used and applied principles
in other cases
which ought to have led them to understand that a proper division of local from federal authority
or some part of the constitution
forbids the federal government to control as to slavery in the federal territories
he is right to say so
but he should
at the same time
brave the responsibility of declaring that
in his opinion
he understands their principles better than they did themselves and especially should he not shirk that responsibility by asserting that they understood the question just as well
and even better
than we do now
but enough
let all who believe that our fathers who framed the government under which we live understood this question just as well
and even better
than we do now
speak as they spoke
and act as they acted upon it
this is all republicans ask all republicans desire in relation to slavery
as those fathers marked it
so let it be again marked
as an evil not to be extended
but to be tolerated and protected only because of and so far as its actual presence among us makes that toleration and protection a necessity
let all the guaranties those fathers gave it be not grudgingly
but fully and fairly
for this republicans contend
and with this
so far as i know or believe
they will be content
and now
if they would listen as i suppose they will not i would address a few words to the southern people
i would say to them
you consider yourselves a reasonable and a just people and i consider that in the general qualities of reason and justice you are not inferior to any other people
when you speak of us republicans
you do so only to denounce us as reptiles
at the best
as no better than outlaws
you will grant a hearing to pirates or murderers
but nothing like it to black republicans
in all your contentions with one another
each of you deems an unconditional condemnation of black republicanism as the first thing to be attended to
such condemnation of us seems to be an indispensable prerequisite license
so to speak among you to be admitted or permitted to speak at all
can you
or not
be prevailed upon to pause and to consider whether this is quite just to us
or even to yourselves
bring forward your charges and specifications
and then be patient long enough to hear us deny or justify
you say we are sectional
we deny it
that makes an issue and the burden of proof is upon you
you produce your proof and what is it
that our party has no existence in your section gets no votes in your section
the fact is substantially true but does it prove the issue
if it does
then in case we should
without change of principle
begin to get votes in your section
we should thereby cease to be sectional
you cannot escape this conclusion and yet
are you willing to abide by it
if you are
you will probably soon find that we have ceased to be sectional
for we shall get votes in your section this very year
you will then begin to discover
as the truth plainly is
that your proof does not touch the issue
the fact that we get no votes in your section is a fact of your making
and not of ours
and if there be fault in that fact
that fault is primarily yours
and remains so until you show that we repel you by some wrong principle or practice
if we do repel you by any wrong principle or practice
the fault is ours but this brings you to where you ought to have started to discussion of the right or wrong of our principle
if our principle
put in practice
would wrong your section for the benefit of ours
or for any other object
then our principle
and we with it
are sectional
and are justly opposed and denounced as such
meet us
on the question of whether our principle
put in practice
would wrong your section and so meet us as if it were possible that something may be said on our side
do you accept the challenge
then you really believe that the principle which our fathers who framed the government under which we live thought so clearly right as to adopt it
and indorse it again and again
upon their official oaths
is in fact so clearly wrong as to demand your condemnation without a moment's consideration
some of you delight to flaunt in our faces the warning against sectional parties given by washington in his farewell address
less than eight years before washington gave that warning
he had
as president of the united states
approved and signed an act of congress enforcing the prohibition of slavery in the northwestern territory
which act embodied the policy of the government upon that subject up to and at the very moment he penned that warning and about one year after he penned it
he wrote lafayette that he considered that prohibition a wise measure
expressing in the same connection his hope that we should at some time have a confederacy of free states
bearing this in mind
and seeing that sectionalism has since arisen upon this same subject
is that warning a weapon in your hands against us
or in our hands against you
could washington himself speak
would he cast the blame of that sectionalism upon us
who sustain his policy
or upon you
who repudiate it
we respect that warning of washington
and we commend it to you
together with his example pointing to the right application of it
but you say you are conservative eminently conservative while we are revolutionary
or something of the sort
what is conservatism
is it not adherence to the old and tried
against the new and untried
we stick to
contend for
the identical old policy on the point in controversy which was adopted by our fathers who framed the government under which we live while you with one accord reject
and scout
and spit upon that old policy
and insist upon substituting something new
you disagree among yourselves as to what that substitute shall be
you are divided on new propositions and plans
but you are unanimous in rejecting and denouncing the old policy of the fathers
some of you are for reviving the foreign slave trade some for a congressional slave code for the territories some for congress forbidding the territories to prohibit slavery within their limits some for maintaining slavery in the territories through the judiciary some for the gur reat pur rinciple that if one man would enslave another
no third man should object
fantastically called popular sovereignty but never a man among you is in favor of federal prohibition of slavery in federal territories
according to the practice of our fathers who framed the government under which we live
not one of all your various plans can show a precedent or an advocate in the century within which our government originated
whether your claim of conservatism for yourselves
and your charge of destructiveness against us
are based on the most clear and stable foundations
you say we have made the slavery question more prominent than it formerly was
we deny it
we admit that it is more prominent
but we deny that we made it so
it was not we
but you
who discarded the old policy of the fathers
we resisted
and still resist
your innovation and thence comes the greater prominence of the question
would you have that question reduced to its former proportions
go back to that old policy
what has been will be again
under the same conditions
if you would have the peace of the old times
readopt the precepts and policy of the old times
you charge that we stir up insurrections among your slaves
we deny it and what is your proof
harper's ferry
john brown
john brown was no republican and you have failed to implicate a single republican in his harper's ferry enterprise
if any member of our party is guilty in that matter
you know it
or you do not know it
if you do know it
you are inexcusable for not designating the man and proving the fact
if you do not know it
you are inexcusable to assert it
and especially to persist in the assertion after you have tried and failed to make the proof
you need not be told that persisting in a charge which one does not know to be true
is simply malicious slander
some of you admit that no republican designedly aided or encouraged the harper's ferry affair
but still insist that our doctrines and declarations necessarily lead to such results
we do not believe it
we know we hold no doctrine
and make no declaration
which were not held to and made by our fathers who framed the government under which we live
you never dealt fairly by us in relation to this affair
when it occurred
some important state elections were near at hand
and you were in evident glee with the belief that
by charging the blame upon us
you could get an advantage of us in those elections
the elections came
and your expectations were not quite fulfilled
every republican man knew that
as to himself at least
your charge was a slander
and he was not much inclined by it to cast his vote in your favor
republican doctrines and declarations are accompanied with a continual protest against any interference whatever with your slaves
or with you about your slaves
this does not encourage them to revolt
we do
in common with our fathers who framed the government under which we live
declare our belief that slavery is wrong but the slaves do not hear us declare even this
for anything we say or do
the slaves would scarcely know there is a republican party
i believe they would not
in fact
generally know it but for your misrepresentations of us in their hearing
in your political contests among yourselves
each faction charges the other with sympathy with black republicanism and then
to give point to the charge
defines black republicanism to simply be insurrection
and thunder among the slaves
slave insurrections are no more common now than they were before the republican party was organized
what induced the southampton insurrection
twenty eight years ago
in which at least three times as many lives were lost as at harper's ferry
you can scarcely stretch your very elastic fancy to the conclusion that southampton was got up by black republicanism
in the present state of things in the united states
i do not think a general
or even a very extensive
slave insurrection is possible
the indispensable concert of action cannot be obtained
the slaves have no means of rapid communication nor can incendiary freemen
black or white
supply it
the explosive materials are everywhere in parcels but there neither are
nor can be supplied
the indispensable connecting trains
much is said by southern people about the affection of slaves for their masters and mistresses and a part of it
at least
is true
a plot for an uprising could scarcely be devised and communicated to twenty individuals before some one of them
to save the life of a favorite master or mistress
would divulge it
this is the rule and the slave revolution in hayti was not an exception to it
but a case occurring under peculiar circumstances
the gunpowder plot of british history
though not connected with slaves
was more in point
in that case
only about twenty were admitted to the secret and yet one of them
in his anxiety to save a friend
betrayed the plot to that friend
by consequence
averted the calamity
occasional poisonings from the kitchen
and open or stealthy assassinations in the field
and local revolts extending to a score or so will continue to occur as the natural results of slavery but no general insurrection of slaves
as i think
can happen in this country for a long time
whoever much fears
or much hopes
for such an event
will be alike disappointed
in the language of mr
uttered many years ago
it is still in our power to direct the process of emancipation and deportation peaceably
and in such slow degrees
as that the evil will wear off insensibly and their places be
pari passu
filled up by free white laborers
on the contrary
it is left to force itself on
human nature must shudder at the prospect held up
mr
jefferson did not mean to say
nor do i
that the power of emancipation is in the federal government
he spoke of virginia and
as to the power of emancipation
i speak of the slaveholding states only
the federal government
as we insist
has the power of restraining the extension of the institution the power to insure that a slave insurrection shall never occur on any american soil which is now free from slavery
john brown's effort was peculiar
it was not a slave insurrection
it was an attempt by white men to get up a revolt among slaves
in which the slaves refused to participate
in fact
it was so absurd that the slaves
with all their ignorance
saw plainly enough it could not succeed
that affair
in its philosophy
corresponds with the many attempts
related in history
at the assassination of kings and emperors
an enthusiast broods over the oppression of a people till he fancies himself commissioned by heaven to liberate them
he ventures the attempt
which ends in little else than in his own execution
orsini's attempt on louis napoleon
and john brown's attempt at harper's ferry
in their philosophy
precisely the same
the eagerness to cast blame on old england in the one case
and on new england in the other
does not disprove the sameness of the two things
and how much would it avail you
if you could
by the use of john brown
helper's book
and the like
break up the republican organization
human action can be modified to some extent
but human nature cannot be changed
there is a judgment and a feeling against slavery in this nation
which cast at least a million and a half of votes
you cannot destroy that judgment and feeling that sentiment by breaking up the political organization which rallies around it
you can scarcely scatter and disperse an army which has been formed into order in the face of your heaviest fire but if you could
how much would you gain by forcing the sentiment which created it out of the peaceful channel of the ballot box into some other channel
what would that other channel probably be
would the number of john browns be lessened or enlarged by the operation
but you will break up the union rather than submit to a denial of your constitutional rights
that has a somewhat reckless sound but it would be palliated
if not fully justified
were we proposing
by the mere force of numbers
to deprive you of some right plainly written down in the constitution
but we are proposing no such thing
when you make these declarations you have a specific and well understood allusion to an assumed constitutional right of yours to take slaves into the federal territories
and to hold them there as property
but no such right is specifically written in the constitution
that instrument is literally silent about any such right
on the contrary
deny that such a right has any existence in the constitution
even by implication
your purpose
plainly stated
is that you will destroy the government
unless you be allowed to construe and force the constitution as you please
on all points in dispute between you and us
you will rule or ruin in all events
plainly stated
is your language
perhaps you will say the supreme court has decided the disputed constitutional question in your favor
not quite so
but waiving the lawyer's distinction between dictum and decision
the court has decided the question for you in a sort of way
the court has substantially said
it is your constitutional right to take slaves into the federal territories
and to hold them there as property
when i say the decision was made in a sort of way
i mean it was made in a divided court
by a bare majority of the judges
and they not quite agreeing with one another in the reasons for making it that it is so made as that its avowed supporters disagree with one another about its meaning
and that it was mainly based upon a mistaken statement of fact the statement in the opinion that the right of property in a slave is distinctly and expressly affirmed in the constitution
an inspection of the constitution will show that the right of property in a slave is not distinctly and expressly affirmed in it
bear in mind
the judges do not pledge their judicial opinion that such right is impliedly affirmed in the constitution but they pledge their veracity that it is distinctly and expressly affirmed there distinctly
that is
not mingled with anything else expressly
that is
in words meaning just that
without the aid of any inference
and susceptible of no other meaning
if they had only pledged their judicial opinion that such right is affirmed in the instrument by implication
it would be open to others to show that neither the word slave nor slavery is to be found in the constitution
nor the word property even
in any connection with language alluding to the things slave
or slavery and that wherever in that instrument the slave is alluded to
he is called a person and wherever his master's legal right in relation to him is alluded to
it is spoken of as service or labor which may be due as a debt payable in service or labor
also it would be open to show
by contemporaneous history
that this mode of alluding to slaves and slavery
instead of speaking of them
was employed on purpose to exclude from the constitution the idea that there could be property in man
to show all this is easy and certain
when this obvious mistake of the judges shall be brought to their notice
is it not reasonable to expect that they will withdraw the mistaken statement
and reconsider the conclusion based upon it
and then it is to be remembered that our fathers who framed the government under which we live the men who made the constitution decided this same constitutional question in our favor long ago
decided it without a division among themselves when making the decision without division among themselves about the meaning of it after it was made
and so far as any evidence is left
without basing it upon any mistaken statement of facts
under all these circumstances
do you really feel yourself justified to break up this government unless such a court decision as yours is shall be at once submitted to as a conclusive and final rule of political action
but you will not abide the election of a republican president
in that supposed event
you say
you will destroy the union and then
you say
the great crime of having destroyed it will be upon us
that is cool
a highwayman holds a pistol to my ear
and mutters through his teeth
stand and deliver
or i shall kill you
and then you will be a murderer
to be sure
what the robber demanded of me my money was my own and i had a clear right to keep it but it was no more my own than my vote is my own and the threat of death to me
to extort my money
and the threat of destruction to the union
to extort my vote
can scarcely be distinguished in principle
a few words now to republicans
it is exceedingly desirable that all parts of this great confederacy shall be at peace
and in harmony one with another
let us republicans do our part to have it so
even though much provoked
let us do nothing through passion and ill temper
even though the southern people will not so much as listen to us
let us calmly consider their demands
and yield to them if
in our deliberate view of our duty
we possibly can
judging by all they say and do
and by the subject and nature of their controversy with us
let us determine if we can
what will satisfy them
will they be satisfied if the territories be unconditionally surrendered to them
we know they will not
in all their present complaints against us
the territories are scarcely mentioned
invasions and insurrections are the rage now
will it satisfy them if
in the future
we have nothing to do with invasions and insurrections
we know it will not
we so know
because we know we never had anything to do with invasions and insurrections and yet this total abstaining does not exempt us from the charge and the denunciation
the question recurs
what will satisfy them
simply this
we must not only let them alone
but we must somehow convince them that we do let them alone
we know by experience
is no easy task
we have been so trying to convince them from the very beginning of our organization
but with no success
in all our platforms and speeches we have constantly protested our purpose to let them alone but this has had no tendency to convince them
alike unavailing to convince them is the fact that they have never detected a man of us in any attempt to disturb them
these natural and apparently adequate means all failing
what will convince them
and this only
cease to call slavery wrong
and join them in calling it right
and this must be done thoroughly done in acts as well as in words
silence will not be tolerated we must place ourselves avowedly with them
senator douglas's new sedition law must be enacted and enforced
suppressing all declarations that slavery is wrong
whether made in politics
in presses
in pulpits
or in private
we must arrest and return their fugitive slaves with greedy pleasure
we must pull down our free state constitutions
the whole atmosphere must be disinfected from all taint of opposition to slavery
before they will cease to believe that all their troubles proceed from us
i am quite aware they do not state their case precisely in this way
most of them would probably say to us
let us alone do nothing to us
and say what you please about slavery
but we do let them alone
have never disturbed them
so that
after all
it is what we say which dissatisfies them
they will continue to accuse us of doing
until we cease saying
i am also aware they have not as yet in terms demanded the overthrow of our free state constitutions
yet those constitutions declare the wrong of slavery with more solemn emphasis than do all other sayings against it and when all these other sayings shall have been silenced
the overthrow of these constitutions will be demanded
and nothing be left to resist the demand
it is nothing to the contrary that they do not demand the whole of this just now
demanding what they do
and for the reason they do
they can voluntarily stop nowhere short of this consummation
as they do
that slavery is morally right and socially elevating
they cannot cease to demand a full national recognition of it as a legal right and a social blessing
nor can we justifiably withhold this on any ground save our conviction that slavery is wrong
if slavery is right
all words
and constitutions against it are themselves wrong
and should be silenced and swept away
if it is right
we cannot justly object to its nationality its universality if it is wrong
they cannot justly insist upon its extension its enlargement
all they ask we could readily grant
if we thought slavery right all we ask they could as readily grant
if they thought it wrong
their thinking it right and our thinking it wrong is the precise fact upon which depends the whole controversy
thinking it right
as they do
they are not to blame for desiring its full recognition as being right but thinking it wrong
as we do
can we yield to them
can we cast our votes with their view
and against our own
in view of our moral
and political responsibilities
can we do this
wrong as we think slavery is
we can yet afford to let it alone where it is
because that much is due to the necessity arising from its actual presence in the nation but can we
while our votes will prevent it
allow it to spread into the national territories
and to overrun us here in these free states
if our sense of duty forbids this
then let us stand by our duty fearlessly and effectively
let us be diverted by none of those sophistical contrivances wherewith we are so industriously plied and belabored contrivances such as groping for some middle ground between the right and the wrong
vain as the search for a man who should be neither a living man nor a dead man such as a policy of don't care on a question about which all true men do care such as union appeals beseeching true union men to yield to disunionists
reversing the divine rule
and calling
not the sinners
but the righteous to repentance such as invocations to washington
imploring men to unsay what washington said and undo what washington did
neither let us be slandered from our duty by false accusations against us
nor frightened from it by menaces of destruction to the government
nor of dungeons to ourselves
let us have faith that right makes might
and in that faith let us to the end dare to do our duty as we understand it
farewell address at springfield
february 12
1861 my friends
no one not in my position can appreciate the sadness i feel at this parting
to this people i owe all that i am
here i have lived more than a quarter of a century here my children were born
and here one of them lies buried
i know not how soon i shall see you again
a duty devolves upon me which is
greater than that which has devolved upon any other man since the days of washington
he never could have succeeded except for the aid of divine providence
upon which he at all times relied
i feel that i cannot succeed without the same divine aid which sustained him and in the same almighty being i place my reliance for support and i hope you
my friends
will all pray that i may receive that divine assistance
without which i cannot succeed
but with which success is certain
again i bid you all an affectionate farewell
farewell address at springfield
february 11
1861 my friends
no one
not in my situation
can appreciate my feeling of sadness at this parting
to this place
and the kindness of these people
i owe everything
here i have lived a quarter of a century
and have passed from a young to an old man
here my children have been born and one is buried
i now leave
not knowing when or whether ever i may return
with a task before me greater than that which rested upon washington
without the assistance of that divine being who ever attended him
i cannot succeed
with that assistance
i cannot fail
trusting in him
who can go with me and remain with you
and be everywhere for good let us confidently hope that all will yet be well
to his care commending you
as i hope in your prayers you will commend me
i bid you an affectionate farewell
address in independence hall
february 22
1861 mr
i am filled with deep emotion at finding myself standing in this place
where were collected together the wisdom
the patriotism
the devotion to principle
from which sprang the institutions under which we live
you have kindly suggested to me that in my hands is the task of restoring peace to our distracted country
i can say in return
that all the political sentiments i entertain have been drawn
so far as i have been able to draw them
from the sentiments which originated in and were given to the world from this hall
i have never had a feeling politically
that did not spring from the sentiments embodied in the declaration of independence
i have often pondered over the dangers which were incurred by the men who assembled here and framed and adopted that declaration
i have pondered over the toils that were endured by the officers and soldiers of the army who achieved that independence
i have often inquired of myself what great principle or idea it was that kept this confederacy so long together
it was not the mere matter of the separation of the colonies from the motherland
but that sentiment in the declaration of independence which gave liberty not alone to the people of this country
but hope to all the world
for all future time
it was that which gave promise that in due time the weights would be lifted from the shoulders of all men
and that all should have an equal chance
this is the sentiment embodied in the declaration of independence
my friends
can this country be saved on that basis
if it can
i will consider myself one of the happiest men in the world if i can help to save it
if it cannot be saved upon that principle
it will be truly awful
but if this country cannot be saved without giving up that principle
i was about to say i would rather be assassinated on this spot than surrender it
in my view of the present aspect of affairs
there is no need of bloodshed and war
there is no necessity for it
i am not in favor of such a course and i may say in advance that there will be no bloodshed unless it is forced upon the government
the government will not use force
unless force is used against it
my friends
this is wholly an unprepared speech
i did not expect to be called on to say a word when i came here
i supposed i was merely to do something toward raising a flag
i may
have said something indiscreet
cries of no
but i have said nothing but what i am willing to live by
if it be the pleasure of almighty god
to die by
first inaugural address
march 4
1861 fellow citizens of the united states
in compliance with a custom as old as the government itself
i appear before you to address you briefly
and to take in your presence the oath prescribed by the constitution of the united states to be taken by the president before he enters on the execution of his office
i do not consider it necessary at present for me to discuss those matters of administration about which there is no special anxiety or excitement
apprehension seems to exist among the people of the southern states that
by the accession of a republican administration
their property and their peace and personal security are to be endangered
there has never been any reasonable cause for such apprehension
the most ample evidence to the contrary has all the while existed and been open to their inspection
it is found in nearly all the published speeches of him who now addresses you
i do but quote from one of those speeches when i declare that i have no purpose
directly or indirectly
to interfere with the institution of slavery in the states where it exists
i believe i have no lawful right to do so
and i have no inclination to do so
those who nominated and elected me did so with full knowledge that i had made this and many similar declarations
and had never recanted them
more than this
they placed in the platform for my acceptance
and as a law to themselves and to me
the clear and emphatic resolution which i now read
that the maintenance inviolate of the rights of the states
and especially the right of each state to order and control its own domestic institutions according to its own judgment exclusively
is essential to that balance of power on which the perfection and endurance of our political fabric depend
and we denounce the lawless invasion by armed force of the soil of any state or territory
no matter under what pretext
as among the gravest of crimes
i now reiterate these sentiments and
in doing so
i only press upon the public attention the most conclusive evidence of which the case is susceptible
that the property
and security of no section are to be in any wise endangered by the now incoming administration
i add
that all the protection which
consistently with the constitution and the laws
can be given
will be cheerfully given to all the states when lawfully demanded
for whatever cause as cheerfully to one section as to another
there is much controversy about the delivering up of fugitives from service or labor
the clause i now read is as plainly written in the constitution as any other of its provisions
no person held to service or labor in one state
under the laws thereof
escaping into another
shall in consequence of any law or regulation therein be discharged from such service or labor
but shall be delivered up on claim of the party to whom such service or labor may be due
it is scarcely questioned that this provision was intended by those who made it for the reclaiming of what we call fugitive slaves and the intention of the lawgiver is the law
all members of congress swear their support to the whole constitution to this provision as much as to any other
to the proposition
that slaves whose cases come within the terms of this clause shall be delivered up
their oaths are unanimous
if they would make the effort in good temper
could they not with nearly equal unanimity frame and pass a law by means of which to keep good that unanimous oath
there is some difference of opinion whether this clause should be enforced by national or by state authority but surely that difference is not a very material one
if the slave is to be surrendered
it can be of but little consequence to him or to others by which authority it is done
and should any one in any case be content that his oath shall go unkept on a merely unsubstantial controversy as to how it shall be kept
in any law upon this subject
ought not all the safeguards of liberty known in civilized and humane jurisprudence to be introduced
so that a free man be not
in any case
surrendered as a slave
and might it not be well at the same time to provide by law for the enforcement of that clause in the constitution which guarantees that the citizen of each state shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of citizens in the several states
i take the official oath to day with no mental reservations
and with no purpose to construe the constitution or laws by any hypercritical rules
and while i do not choose now to specify particular acts of congress as proper to be enforced
i do suggest that it will be much safer for all
both in official and private stations
to conform to and abide by all those acts which stand unrepealed
than to violate any of them
trusting to find impunity in having them held to be unconstitutional
it is seventy two years since the first inauguration of a president under our national constitution
during that period fifteen different and greatly distinguished citizens have
in succession
administered the executive branch of the government
they have conducted it through many perils
and generally with great success
with all this scope of precedent
i now enter upon the same task for the brief constitutional term of four years under great and peculiar difficulty
a disruption of the federal union
heretofore only menaced
is now formidably attempted
i hold that
in contemplation of universal law and of the constitution
the union of these states is perpetual
perpetuity is implied
if not expressed
in the fundamental law of all national governments
it is safe to assert that no government proper ever had a provision in its organic law for its own termination
continue to execute all the express provisions of our national constitution
and the union will endure forever it being impossible to destroy it except by some action not provided for in the instrument itself
if the united states be not a government proper
but an association of states in the nature of contract merely
can it
as a contract
be peaceably unmade by less than all the parties who made it
one party to a contract may violate it break it
so to speak but does it not require all to lawfully rescind it
descending from these general principles
we find the proposition that
in legal contemplation the union is perpetual confirmed by the history of the union itself
the union is much older than the constitution
it was formed
in fact
by the articles of association in 1774
it was matured and continued by the declaration of independence in 1776
it was further matured
and the faith of all the then thirteen states expressly plighted and engaged that it should be perpetual
by the articles of confederation in 1778
in 1787 one of the declared objects for ordaining and establishing the constitution was to form a more perfect union
but if the destruction of the union by one or by a part only of the states be lawfully possible
the union is less perfect than before the constitution
having lost the vital element of perpetuity
it follows from these views that no state upon its own mere motion can lawfully get out of the union that resolves and ordinances to that effect are legally void and that acts of violence
within any state or states
against the authority of the united states
are insurrectionary or revolutionary
according to circumstances
i therefore consider that
in view of the constitution and the laws
the union is unbroken and to the extent of my ability i shall take care
as the constitution itself expressly enjoins upon me
that the laws of the union be faithfully executed in all the states
doing this i deem to be only a simple duty on my part and i shall perform it so far as practicable
unless my rightful masters
the american people
shall withhold the requisite means
or in some authoritative manner direct the contrary
i trust this will not be regarded as a menace
but only as the declared purpose of the union that it will constitutionally defend and maintain itself
in doing this there needs to be no bloodshed or violence and there shall be none
unless it be forced upon the national authority
the power confided to me will be used to hold
and possess the property and places belonging to the government
and to collect the duties and imposts but beyond what may be necessary for these objects
there will be no invasion
no using of force against or among the people anywhere
where hostility to the united states
in any interior locality
shall be so great and universal as to prevent competent resident citizens from holding the federal offices
there will be no attempt to force obnoxious strangers among the people for that object
while the strict legal right may exist in the government to enforce the exercise of these offices
the attempt to do so would be so irritating
and so nearly impracticable withal
that i deem it better to forego for the time the uses of such offices
the mails
unless repelled
will continue to be furnished in all parts of the union
so far as possible
the people everywhere shall have that sense of perfect security which is most favorable to calm thought and reflection
the course here indicated will be followed unless current events and experience shall show a modification or change to be proper
and in every case and exigency my best discretion will be exercised according to circumstances actually existing
and with a view and a hope of a peaceful solution of the national troubles and the restoration of fraternal sympathies and affections
that there are persons in one section or another who seek to destroy the union at all events
and are glad of any pretext to do it
i will neither affirm nor deny but if there be such
i need address no word to them
to those
who really love the union may i not speak
before entering upon so grave a matter as the destruction of our national fabric
with all its benefits
its memories
and its hopes
would it not be wise to ascertain precisely why we do it
will you hazard so desperate a step while there is any possibility that any portion of the ills you fly from have no real existence
will you
while the certain ills you fly to are greater than all the real ones you fly from will you risk the commission of so fearful a mistake
all profess to be content in the union if all constitutional rights can be maintained
is it true
that any right
plainly written in the constitution
has been denied
i think not
happily the human mind is so constituted that no party can reach to the audacity of doing this
if you can
of a single instance in which a plainly written provision of the constitution has ever been denied
if by the mere force of numbers a majority should deprive a minority of any clearly written constitutional right
it might
in a moral point of view
justify revolution certainly would if such a right were a vital one
but such is not our case
all the vital rights of minorities and of individuals are so plainly assured to them by affirmations and negations
guarantees and prohibitions
in the constitution
that controversies never arise concerning them
but no organic law can ever be framed with a provision specifically applicable to every question which may occur in practical administration
no foresight can anticipate
nor any document of reasonable length contain
express provisions for all possible questions
shall fugitives from labor be surrendered by national or by state authority
the constitution does not expressly say
may congress prohibit slavery in the territories
the constitution does not expressly say
must congress protect slavery in the territories
the constitution does not expressly say
from questions of this class spring all our constitutional controversies
and we divide upon them into majorities and minorities
if the minority will not acquiesce
the majority must
or the government must cease
there is no other alternative for continuing the government is acquiescence on one side or the other
if a minority in such case will secede rather than acquiesce
they make a precedent which in turn will divide and ruin them for a minority of their own will secede from them whenever a majority refuses to be controlled by such minority
for instance
why may not any portion of a new confederacy a year or two hence arbitrarily secede again
precisely as portions of the present union now claim to secede from it
all who cherish disunion sentiments are now being educated to the exact temper of doing this
is there such perfect identity of interests among the states to compose a new union
as to produce harmony only
and prevent renewed secession
the central idea of secession is the essence of anarchy
a majority held in restraint by constitutional checks and limitations
and always changing easily with deliberate changes of popular opinions and sentiments
is the only true sovereign of a free people
whoever rejects it does
of necessity
fly to anarchy or to despotism
unanimity is impossible the rule of a minority
as a permanent arrangement
is wholly inadmissible so that
rejecting the majority principle
anarchy or despotism in some form is all that is left
i do not forget the position
assumed by some
that constitutional questions are to be decided by the supreme court nor do i deny that such decisions must be binding
in any case
upon the parties to a suit
as to the object of that suit
while they are also entitled to very high respect and consideration in all parallel cases by all other departments of the government
and while it is obviously possible that such decision may be erroneous in any given case
still the evil effect following it
being limited to that particular case
with the chance that it may be overruled and never become a precedent for other cases
can better be borne than could the evils of a different practice
at the same time
the candid citizen must confess that if the policy of the government
upon vital questions affecting the whole people
is to be irrevocably fixed by decisions of the supreme court
the instant they are made
in ordinary litigation between parties in personal actions
the people will have ceased to be their own rulers
having to that extent practically resigned their government into the hands of that eminent tribunal
nor is there in this view any assault upon the court or the judges
it is a duty from which they may not shrink to decide cases properly brought before them
and it is no fault of theirs if others seek to turn their decisions to political purposes
one section of our country believes slavery is right
and ought to be extended
while the other believes it is wrong
and ought not to be extended
this is the only substantial dispute
the fugitive slave clause of the constitution
and the law for the suppression of the foreign slave trade
are each as well enforced
perhaps as any law can ever be in a community where the moral sense of the people imperfectly supports the law itself
the great body of the people abide by the dry legal obligation in both cases
and a few break over in each
i think
cannot be perfectly cured and it would be worse in both cases after the separation of the sections than before
the foreign slave trade
now imperfectly suppressed
would be ultimately revived
without restriction
in one section
while fugitive slaves
now only partially surrendered
would not be surrendered at all by the other
physically speaking
we cannot separate
we cannot remove our respective sections from each other
nor build an impassable wall between them
a husband and wife may be divorced
and go out of the presence and beyond the reach of each other but the different parts of our country cannot do this
they cannot but remain face to face
and intercourse either amicable or hostile
must continue between them
is it possible
to make that intercourse more advantageous or more satisfactory after separation than before
can aliens make treaties easier than friends can make laws
can treaties be more faithfully enforced between aliens than laws can among friends
suppose you go to war
you cannot fight always and when
after much loss on both sides
and no gain on either
you cease fighting
the identical old questions as to terms of intercourse are again upon you
this country
with its institutions
belongs to the people who inhabit it
whenever they shall grow weary of the existing government
they can exercise their constitutional right of amending it
or their revolutionary right to dismember or overthrow it
i cannot be ignorant of the fact that many worthy and patriotic citizens are desirious of having the national constitution amended
while i make no recommendation of amendments
i fully recognize the rightful authority of the people over the whole subject
to be exercised in either of the modes prescribed in the instrument itself and i should
under existing circumstances
favor rather than oppose a fair opportunity being afforded the people to act upon it
i will venture to add that to me the convention mode seems preferable
in that it allows amendments to originate with the people themselves
instead of only permitting them to take or reject propositions originated by others not especially chosen for the purpose
and which might not be precisely such as they would wish to either accept or refuse
i understand a proposed amendment to the constitution which amendment
i have not seen has passed congress
to the effect that the federal government shall never interfere with the domestic institutions of the states
including that of persons held to service
to avoid misconstruction of what i have said
i depart from my purpose not to speak of particular amendments so far as to say that
holding such a provision to now be implied constitutional law
i have no objection to its being made express and irrevocable
the chief magistrate derives all his authority from the people
and they have conferred none upon him to fix terms for the separation of the states
the people themselves can do this also if they choose
but the executive
as such
has nothing to do with it
his duty is to administer the present government
as it came to his hands
and to transmit it
unimpaired by him
to his successor
why should there not be a patient confidence in the ultimate justice of the people
is there any better or equal hope in the world
in our present differences is either party without faith of being in the right
if the almighty ruler of nations
with his eternal truth and justice
be on your side of the north
or on yours of the south
that truth and that justice will surely prevail by the judgment of this great tribunal of the american people
by the frame of the government under which we live
this same people have wisely given their public servants but little power for mischief and have
with equal wisdom
provided for the return of that little to their own hands at very short intervals
while the people retain their virtue and vigilance
no administration
by any extreme of wickedness or folly
can very seriously injure the government in the short space of four years
my countrymen
one and all
think calmly and well upon this whole subject
nothing valuable can be lost by taking time
if there be an object to hurry any of you in hot haste to a step which you would never take deliberately
that object will be frustrated by taking time but no good object can be frustrated by it
such of you as are now dissatisfied
still have the old constitution unimpaired
on the sensitive point
the laws of your own framing under it while the new administration will have no immediate power
if it would
to change either
if it were admitted that you who are dissatisfied hold the right side in the dispute
there still is no single good reason for precipitate action
and a firm reliance on him who has never yet forsaken this favored land
are still competent to adjust in the best way all your present difficulties
in your hands
my dissatisfied fellow countrymen
and not in mine
is the momentous issue of civil war
the government will not assail you
you can have no conflict without being yourselves the aggressors
you have no oath registered in heaven to destroy the government
while i shall have the most solemn one to preserve
and defend it
i am loath to close
we are not enemies
but friends
we must not be enemies
though passion may have strained
it must not break our bonds of affection
the mystic chords of memory
stretching from every battle field and patriot grave to every living heart and hearthstone all over this broad land
will yet swell the chorus of the union when again touched
as surely they will be
by the better angels of our nature
response to a serenade
march 4
1861 fellow citizens
i thank you for this visit
i thank you that you call upon me
not in any sectional spirit
but that you come
without distinction of party
to pay your respects to the president of the united states
i am informed that you are mostly citizens of new york
cries of all
all
you all appear to be very happy
may i hope that the public expression which i have this day given to my sentiments
may have contributed in some degree to your happiness
emphatic exclamations of assent
as far as i am concerned
the loyal citizens of every state
and of every section
shall have no cause to feel any other sentiment
cries of good
good
as towards the disaffected portions of our fellow citizens
i will say
as every good man throughout the country must feel
that there will be more rejoicing over one sheep that is lost
and is found
than over the ninety and nine which have not gone astray
great cheering
and now
my friends
as i have risen from the dinner table to see you
you will excuse me for the brevity of my remarks
and permit me again to thank you heartily and cordially for the pleasant visit
as i rejoin those who await my return
letter to colonel ellsworth's parents washington
may 25
to the father and mother of colonel elmer e
my dear sir and madam
in the untimely loss of your noble son
our affliction here is scarcely less than your own
so much of promised usefulness to one's country
and of bright hopes for one's self and friends
have rarely been so suddenly dashed as in his fall
in size
in years
and in youthful appearance a boy only
his power to command men was surpassingly great
this power
combined with a fine intellect
an indomitable energy
and a taste altogether military
constituted in him
as seemed to me
the best natural talent in that department i ever knew
and yet
he was singularly modest and deferential in social intercourse
my acquaintance with him began less than two years ago yet through the latter part of the intervening period it was as intimate as the disparity of our ages and my engrossing engagements would permit
to me he appeared to have no indulgences or pastimes and i never heard him utter a profane or an intemperate word
what was conclusive of his good heart
he never forgot his parents
the honors he labored for so laudably
and for which in the sad end he so gallantly gave his life
he meant for them no less than for himself
in the hope that it may be no intrusion upon the sacredness of your sorrow
i have ventured to address you this tribute to the memory of my young friend and your brave and early fallen child
may god give you that consolation which is beyond all earthly power
sincerely your friend in a common affliction
letter to horace greeley executive mansion
august 22
horace greeley
dear sir
i have just read yours of the 19th
addressed to myself through the n
if there be in it any statements or assumptions of fact which i may know to be erroneous
i do not now and here controvert them
if there be in it any inferences which i may believe to be falsely drawn
i do not now and here argue against them
if there be perceptible in it an impatient and dictatorial tone
i waive it in deference to an old friend
whose heart i have always supposed to be right
as to the policy i seem to be pursuing
as you say
i have not meant to leave any one in doubt
i would save the union
i would save it in the shortest way under the constitution
the sooner the national authority can be restored
the nearer the union will be the union as it was
if there be those who would not save the union unless they could at the same time save slavery
i do not agree with them
if there be those who would not save the union unless they could at the same time destroy slavery
i do not agree with them
my paramount object in this struggle is to save the union
and is not either to save or to destroy slavery
if i could save the union without freeing any slave
i would do it if i could save it by freeing all the slaves
i would do it and if i could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone
i would also do that
what i do about slavery and the colored race
i do because i believe it helps to save this union and what i forbear
i forbear because i do not believe it would help to save the union
i shall do less whenever i shall believe that what i am doing hurts the cause
and i shall do more whenever i shall believe doing more will help the cause
i shall try to correct errors when shown to be errors and i shall adopt new views as fast as they shall appear to be true views
i have here stated my purpose according to my views of official duty and i intend no modification of my oft expressed personal wish that all men
everywhere could be free
extract from the second annual message to congress
december 1
1862 a nation may be said to consist of its territory
its people
and its laws
the territory is the only part which is of certain durability
one generation passeth away
and another generation cometh
but the earth abideth forever
it is of the first importance to duly consider and estimate this ever enduring part
that portion of the earth's surface which is owned and inhabited by the people of the united states is well adapted to be the home of one national family
and it is not well adapted for two or more
its vast extent and its variety of climate and productions are of advantage in this age for one people whatever they might have been in former ages
and intelligence have brought these to be an advantageous combination for one united people
in the inaugural address i briefly pointed out the total inadequacy of disunion as a remedy for the differences between the people of the two sections
i did so in language which i cannot improve and which
i beg to repeat
one section of our country believes slavery is right and ought to be extended
while the other believes it is wrong and ought not to be extended
this is the only substantial dispute
the fugitive slave clause of the constitution and the law for the suppression of the foreign slave trade are each as well enforced
as any law can ever be in a community where the moral sense of the people imperfectly supports the law itself
the great body of the people abide by the dry legal obligation in both cases
and a few break over in each
i think
cannot be perfectly cured and it would be worse in both cases after the separation of the sections than before
the foreign slave trade
now imperfectly suppressed
would be ultimately revived without restriction in one section while fugitive slaves
now only partially surrendered
would not be surrendered at all by the other
physically speaking
we cannot separate
we cannot remove our respective sections from each other
nor build an impassable wall between them
a husband and wife may be divorced and go out of the presence and beyond the reach of each other but the different parts of our country cannot do this
they cannot but remain face to face and intercourse
either amicable or hostile
must continue between them
is it possible
to make that intercourse more advantageous or more satisfactory after separation than before
can aliens make treaties easier than friends can make laws
can treaties be more faithfully enforced between aliens than laws can among friends
suppose you go to war
you cannot fight always and when
after much loss on both sides and no gain on either
you cease fighting
the identical old questions as to terms of intercourse are again upon you
there is no line
straight or crooked
suitable for a national boundary upon which to divide
trace through
from east to west
upon the line between the free and slave country
and we shall find a little more than one third of its length are rivers
easy to be crossed
and populated
or soon to be populated
thickly upon both sides while nearly all its remaining length are merely surveyors' lines
over which people may walk and back forth without any consciousness of their presence
no part of this line can be made any more difficult to pass by writing it down on paper or parchment as a national boundary
the fact of separation
if it comes
gives up on the part of the seceding section the fugitive slave clause along with all other constitutional obligations upon the section seceded from
while i should expect no treaty stipulation would be ever made to take its place
but there is another difficulty
the great interior region
bounded east by the alleghanies
north by the british dominions
west by the rocky mountains
and south by the line along which the culture of corn and cotton meets
and which includes part of virginia
part of tennessee
all of kentucky
and the territories of dakota
and part of colorado
already has above ten millions of people
and will have fifty millions within fifty years if not prevented by any political folly or mistake
it contains more than one third of the country owned by the united states certainly more than one million of square miles
once half as populous as massachusetts already is
it would have more than seventy five millions of people
a glance at the map shows that
territorially speaking
it is the great body of the republic
the other parts are but marginal borders to it
the magnificent region sloping west from the rocky mountains to the pacific being the deepest and also the richest in undeveloped resources
in the production of provisions
and all which proceed from them
this great interior region is naturally one of the most important in the world
ascertain from the statistics the small proportion of the region which has
as yet
been brought into cultivation
and also the large and rapidly increasing amount of its products
and we shall be overwhelmed with the magnitude of the prospect presented and yet this region has no seacoast
touches no ocean anywhere
as part of one nation
its people now find
and may forever find
their way to europe by new york
to south america and africa by new orleans
and to asia by san francisco
but separate our common country into two nations
as designed by the present rebellion
and every man of this great interior region is thereby cut off from some one or more of these outlets not
by a physical barrier
but by embarrassing and onerous trade regulations
and this is true wherever a dividing or boundary line may be fixed
place it between the now free and slave country
or place it south of kentucky or north of ohio
and still the truth remains that none south of it can trade to any port or place north of it
and none north of it can trade to any port or place south of it except upon terms dictated by a government foreign to them
these outlets
and south
are indispensable to the well being of the people inhabiting
and to inhabit
this vast interior region
which of the three may be the best
is no proper question
all are better than either and all of right belong to that people and to their successors forever
true to themselves
they will not ask where a line of separation shall be
but will vow rather that there shall be no such line
nor are the marginal regions less interested in these communications to and through them to the great outside world
and each of them
must have access to this egypt of the west without paying toll at the crossing of any national boundary
our national strife springs not from our permanent part
not from the land we inhabit
not from our national homestead
there is no possible severing of this but would multiply
and not mitigate
evils among us
in all its adaptations and aptitudes it demands union and abhors separation
in fact
it would ere long force reunion
however much of blood and treasure the separation might have cost
our strife pertains to ourselves to the passing generations of men and it can without convulsion be hushed forever with the passing of one generation
i do not forget the gravity which should characterize a paper addressed to the congress of the nation by the chief magistrate of the nation
nor do i forget that some of you are my seniors
nor that many of you have more experience than i in the conduct of public affairs
yet i trust that in view of the great responsibility resting upon me
you will perceive no want of respect to yourselves in any undue earnestness i may seem to display
is it doubted
that the plan i propose
if adopted
would shorten the war
and thus lessen its expenditure of money and of blood
is it doubted that it would restore the national authority and national prosperity
and perpetuate both indefinitely
is it doubted that we here congress and executive can secure its adoption
will not the good people respond to a united and earnest appeal from us
can we
can they
by any other means so certainly or so speedily assure these vital objects
we can succeed only by concert
it is not can any of us imagine better
but
can we all do better
object whatsoever is possible
still the question occurs
can we do better
the dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate to the stormy present
the occasion is piled high with difficulty
and we must rise with the occasion
as our case is new
so we must think anew and act anew
we must disenthral ourselves
and then we shall save our country
we cannot escape history
we of this congress and this administration will be remembered in spite of ourselves
no personal significance or insignificance can spare one or another of us
the fiery trial through which we pass will light us down
in honor or dishonor
to the latest generation
we say we are for the union
the world will not forget that we say this
we know how to save the union
the world knows we do know how to save it
we even we here hold the power and bear the responsibility
in giving freedom to the slave
we assure freedom to the free honorable alike in what we give and what we preserve
we shall nobly save or meanly lose the last
best hope of earth
other means may succeed this could not fail
the way is plain
just a way which
if followed
the world will forever applaud
and god must forever bless

the emancipation proclamation
january 1
1863 whereas
on the twenty second day of september
in the year of our lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty two
a proclamation was issued by the president of the united states
among other things
the following
to wit
that on the first day of january
in the year of our lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty three
all persons held as slaves within any state
or designated part of a state
the people whereof shall then be in rebellion against the united states
shall be then
and forever free and the executive government of the united states
including the military and naval authority thereof
will recognize and maintain the freedom of such persons
and will do no act or acts to repress such persons
or any of them
in any efforts they may make for their actual freedom
that the executive will
on the first day of january aforesaid
by proclamation
designate the states and parts of states
if any
in which the people thereof respectively shall then be in rebellion against the united states and the fact that any state
or the people thereof
shall on that day be in good faith represented in the congress of the united states by members chosen thereto at elections wherein a majority of the qualified voters of such state shall have participated
shall in the absence of strong countervailing testimony be deemed conclusive evidence that such state and the people thereof are not then in rebellion against the united states
now
abraham lincoln
president of the united states
by virtue of the power in me vested as commander in chief of the army and navy of the united states
in time of actual armed rebellion against the authority and government of the united states
and as a fit and necessary war measure for suppressing said rebellion
on this first day of january
in the year of our lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty three
and in accordance with my purpose so to do
publicly proclaimed for the full period of 100 days from the day first above mentioned
order and designate as the states and parts of states wherein the people thereof
are this day in rebellion against the united states
the following
to wit
arkansas
louisiana except the parishes of st
terre bonne
and orleans
including the city of new orleans
south carolina
north carolina
and virginia except the forty eight counties designated as west virginia
and also the counties of berkeley
elizabeth city
princess ann
and norfolk
including the cities of norfolk and portsmouth
and which excepted parts are for the present left precisely as if this proclamation were not issued
and by virtue of the power and for the purpose aforesaid
i do order and declare that all persons held as slaves within said designated states and parts of states are
and henceforward shall be
free and that the executive government of the united states
including the military and naval authorities thereof
will recognize and maintain the freedom of said persons
and i hereby enjoin upon the people so declared to be free to abstain from all violence
unless in necessary self defence
and i recommend to them that
in all cases when allowed
they labor faithfully for reasonable wages
and i further declare and make known that such persons of suitable condition will be received into the armed service of the united states to garrison forts
and other places
and to man vessels of all sorts in said service
and upon this act
sincerely believed to be an act of justice
warranted by the constitution upon military necessity
i invoke the considerate judgment of mankind and the gracious favor of almighty god
thanksgiving proclamation
july 15
1863 it has pleased almighty god to hearken to the supplications and prayers of an afflicted people
and to vouchsafe to the army and navy of the united states victories on land and on the sea so signal and so effective as to furnish reasonable grounds for augmented confidence that the union of these states will be maintained
their constitution preserved
and their peace and prosperity permanently restored
but these victories have been accorded not without sacrifices of life
and liberty
incurred by brave
and patriotic citizens
domestic affliction in every part of the country follows in the train of these fearful bereavements
it is meet and right to recognize and confess the presence of the almighty father
and the power of his hand equally in these triumphs and in these sorrows
be it known that i do set apart thursday
the 6th day of august next
to be observed as a day for national thanksgiving
and prayer
and i invite the people of the united states to assemble on that occasion in their customary places of worship
in the forms approved by their own consciences
render the homage due to the divine majesty for the wonderful things he has done in the nation's behalf
and invoke the influence of his holy spirit to subdue the anger which has produced and so long sustained a needless and cruel rebellion
to change the hearts of the insurgents
to guide the counsels of the government with wisdom
adequate to so great a national emergency
and to visit with tender care and consolation throughout the length and breadth of our land all those who
through the vicissitudes of marches
and sieges have been brought to suffer in mind
or estate
and finally to lead the whole nation through the paths of repentance and submission to the divine will back to the perfect enjoyment of union and fraternal peace
letter to j
conkling executive mansion
august 26
james c
my dear sir
your letter inviting me to attend a mass meeting of unconditional union men
to be held at the capital of illinois on the 3d day of september
has been received
it would be very agreeable to me to thus meet my old friends at my own home but i cannot just now be absent from here so long as a visit there would require
the meeting is to be of all those who maintain unconditional devotion to the union and i am sure my old political friends will thank me for tendering
as i do
the nation's gratitude to those and other noble men whom no partizan malice or partizan hope can make false to the nation's life
there are those who are dissatisfied with me
to such i would say
you desire peace
and you blame me that we do not have it
but how can we attain it
there are but three conceivable ways
to suppress the rebellion by force of arms
this i am trying to do
are you for it
if you are
so far we are agreed
if you are not for it
a second way is to give up the union
i am against this
are you for it
if you are
you should say so plainly
if you are not for force
nor yet for dissolution
there only remains some imaginable compromise
i do not believe that any compromise embracing the maintenance of the union is now possible
all i learn leads to a directly opposite belief
the strength of the rebellion is its military
its army
that army dominates all the country and all the people within its range
any offer of terms made by any man or men within that range
in opposition to that army
is simply nothing for the present
because such man or men have no power whatever to enforce their side of a compromise
if one were made with them
to illustrate
suppose refugees from the south and peace men of the north get together in convention
and frame and proclaim a compromise embracing a restoration of the union
in what way can that compromise be used to keep lee's army out of pennsylvania
meade's army can keep lee's army out of pennsylvania
i think
can ultimately drive it out of existence
but no paper compromise to which the controllers of lee's army are not agreed can at all affect that army
in an effort at such compromise we should waste time which the enemy would improve to our disadvantage and that would be all
a compromise
to be effective
must be made either with those who control the rebel army
or with the people first liberated from the domination of that army by the success of our own army
allow me to assure you that no word or intimation from that rebel army
or from any of the men controlling it
in relation to any peace compromise
has ever come to my knowledge or belief
all charges and insinuations to the contrary are deceptive and groundless
and i promise you that if any such proposition shall hereafter come
it shall not be rejected and kept a secret from you
i freely acknowledge myself the servant of the people
according to the bond of service
the united states constitution
and that
as such
i am responsible to them
but to be plain
you are dissatisfied with me about the negro
quite likely there is a difference of opinion between you and myself upon that subject
i certainly wish that all men could be free
while i suppose you do not
yet i have neither adopted nor proposed any measure which is not consistent with even your views
provided you are for the union
i suggested compensated emancipation
to which you replied you wished not to be taxed to buy negroes
but i had not asked you to be taxed to buy negroes
except in such way as to save you from greater taxation to save the union exclusively by other means
you dislike the emancipation proclamation
and perhaps would have it retracted
you say it is unconstitutional
i think differently
i think the constitution invests its commander in chief with the law of war in time of war
the most that can be said if so much is
that slaves are property
is there
has there ever been
any question that
by the law of war
both of enemies and friends
may be taken when needed
and is it not needed whenever taking it helps us or hurts the enemy
the world over
destroy enemies' property when they cannot use it
and even destroy their own to keep it from the enemy
civilized belligerents do all in their power to help themselves or hurt the enemy
except a few things regarded as barbarous or cruel
among the exceptions are the massacre of vanquished foes and non combatants
male and female
but the proclamation
as law
either is valid or is not valid
if it is not valid
it needs no retraction
if it is valid
it cannot be retracted any more than the dead can be brought to life
some of you profess to think its retraction would operate favorably for the union
why better after the retraction than before the issue
there was more than a year and a half of trial to suppress the rebellion before the proclamation issued
the last one hundred days of which passed under an explicit notice that it was coming
unless averted by those in revolt returning to their allegiance
the war has certainly progressed as favorably for us since the issue of the proclamation as before
i know
as fully as one can know the opinions of others
that some of the commanders of our armies in the field who have given us our most important successes
believe the emancipation policy and the use of colored troops constitute the heaviest blow yet dealt to the rebellion
and that at least one of these important successes could not have been achieved when it was but for the aid of black soldiers
among the commanders holding these views are some who have never had any affinity with what is called abolitionism
or with republican party politics
but who hold them purely as military opinions
i submit their opinions as being entitled to some weight against the objections often urged that emancipation and arming the blacks are unwise as military measures
and were not adopted as such in good faith
you say you will not fight to free negroes
some of them seem willing to fight for you but no matter
fight you
to save the union
i issued the proclamation on purpose to aid you in saving the union
whenever you shall have conquered all resistance to the union
if i shall urge you to continue fighting
it will be an apt time then for you to declare you will not fight to free negroes
i thought that in your struggle for the union
to whatever extent the negroes should cease helping the enemy
to that extent it weakened the enemy in his resistance to you
do you think differently
i thought that whatever negroes can be got to do as soldiers
leaves just so much less for white soldiers to do in saving the union
does it appear otherwise to you
but negroes
like other people
act upon motives
why should they do anything for us if we will do nothing for them
if they stake their lives for us they must be prompted by the strongest motive
even the promise of freedom
and the promise being made
must be kept
the signs look better
the father of waters again goes unvexed to the sea
thanks to the great northwest for it
nor yet wholly to them
three hundred miles up they met new england
and jersey
hewing their way right and left
the sunny south
in more colors than one
also lent a hand
on the spot
their part of the history was jotted down in black and white
the job was a great national one
and let none be banned who bore an honorable part in it
and while those who have cleared the great river may well be proud
even that is not all
it is hard to say that anything has been more bravely and well done than at antietam
and on many fields of lesser note
nor must uncle sam's webfeet be forgotten
at all the watery margins they have been present
not only on the deep sea
the broad bay
and the rapid river
but also up the narrow
muddy bayou
and wherever the ground was a little damp
they have been and made their tracks
thanks to all
for the great republic
for the principle it lives by and keeps alive
for man's vast future
thanks to all
peace does not appear so distant as it did
i hope it will come soon
and come to stay and so come as to be worth the keeping in all future time
it will then have been proved that among freemen there can be no successful appeal from the ballot to the bullet
and that they who take such appeal are sure to lose their case and pay the cost
and then there will be some black men who can remember that with silent tongue
and clenched teeth
and steady eye
and well poised bayonet
they have helped mankind on to this great consummation
while i fear there will be some white ones unable to forget that with malignant heart and deceitful speech they strove to hinder it
let us not be over sanguine of a speedy
final triumph
let us be quite sober
let us diligently apply the means
never doubting that a just god
in his own good time
will give us the rightful result
yours very truly
the gettysburg address
1863 fourscore and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation
conceived in liberty
and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal
now we are engaged in a great civil war
testing whether that nation
or any nation so conceived and so dedicated
can long endure
we are met on a great battle field of that war
we have come to dedicate a portion of that field as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live
it is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this
in a larger sense
we cannot dedicate we cannot consecrate we cannot hallow this ground
the brave men
living and dead
who struggled here
have consecrated it far above our poor power to add or detract
the world will little note nor long remember what we say here
but it can never forget what they did here
it is for us
the living
to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced
it is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain that this nation
under god
shall have a new birth of freedom and that government of the people
by the people
for the people
shall not perish from the earth
letter to mrs
bixby executive mansion
to mrs
dear madam
i have been shown in the files of the war department a statement of the adjutant general of massachusetts that you are the mother of five sons who have died gloriously on the field of battle
i feel how weak and fruitless must be any word of mine which should attempt to beguile you from the grief of a loss so overwhelming
but i cannot refrain from tendering to you the consolation that may be found in the thanks of the republic they died to save
i pray that our heavenly father may assuage the anguish of your bereavement
and leave you only the cherished memory of the loved and lost
and the solemn pride that must be yours to have laid so costly a sacrifice upon the altar of freedom
yours very sincerely and respectfully
second inaugural address
march 4
1865 fellow countrymen
at this second appearing to take the oath of the presidential office
there is less occasion for an extended address than there was at the first
then a statement
somewhat in detail
of a course to be pursued
seemed fitting and proper
at the expiration of four years
during which public declarations have been constantly called forth on every point and phase of the great contest which still absorbs the attention and engrosses the energies of the nation
little that is new could be presented
the progress of our arms
upon which all else chiefly depends
is as well known to the public as to myself and it is
i trust
reasonably satisfactory and encouraging to all
with high hope for the future
no prediction in regard to it is ventured
on the occasion corresponding to this four years ago
all thoughts were anxiously directed to an impending civil war
all dreaded it all sought to avert it
while the inaugural address was being delivered from this place
devoted altogether to saving the union without war
insurgent agents were in the city seeking to destroy it without war seeking to dissolve the union
and divide effects
by negotiation
both parties deprecated war but one of them would make war rather than let the nation survive and the other would accept war rather than let it perish
and the war came
one eighth of the whole population were colored slaves
not distributed generally over the union
but localized in the southern part of it
these slaves constituted a peculiar and powerful interest
all knew that this interest was
the cause of the war
to strengthen
and extend this interest was the object for which the insurgents would rend the union
even by war while the government claimed no right to do more than to restrict the territorial enlargement of it
neither party expected for the war the magnitude or the duration which it has already attained
neither anticipated that the cause of the conflict might cease with
or even before
the conflict itself should cease
each looked for an easier triumph
and a result less fundamental and astounding
both read the same bible
and pray to the same god and each invokes his aid against the other
it may seem strange that any men should dare to ask a just god's assistance in wringing their bread from the sweat of other men's faces but let us judge not
that we be not judged
the prayers of both could not be answered that of neither has been answered fully
the almighty has his own purposes
woe unto the world because of offences
for it must needs be that offences come but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh
if we shall suppose that american slavery is one of those offences which
in the providence of god
must needs come
but which
having continued through his appointed time
he now wills to remove
and that he gives to both north and south this terrible war
as the woe due to those by whom the offence came
shall we discern therein any departure from those divine attributes which the believers in a living god always ascribe to him
fondly do we hope fervently do we pray that this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away
if god wills that it continue until all the wealth piled by the bondman's two hundred and fifty years of unrequited toil shall be sunk
and until every drop of blood drawn with the lash shall be paid by another drawn with the sword
as was said three thousand years ago
so still it must be said
the judgments of the lord are true and righteous altogether
with malice toward none with charity for all with firmness in the right
as god gives us to see the right
let us strive on to finish the work we are in to bind up the nation's wounds to care for him who shall have borne the battle
and for his widow
and his orphan to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves
and with all nations
last public address
april 11
1865 we meet this evening not in sorrow
but in gladness of heart
the evacuation of petersburg and richmond
and the surrender of the principal insurgent army
give hope of a righteous and speedy peace
whose joyous expression cannot be restrained
in the midst of this
he from whom all blessings flow
must not be forgotten
a call for a national thanksgiving is being prepared
and will be duly promulgated
nor must those whose harder part give us the cause of rejoicing be overlooked
their honors must not be parcelled out with others
i myself was near the front
and had the high pleasure of transmitting much of the good news to you but no part of the honor for plan or execution is mine
to general grant
his skilful officers and brave men
all belongs
the gallant navy stood ready
but was not in reach to take active part
by these recent successes the reinauguration of the national authority reconstruction which has had a large share of thought from the first
is pressed much more closely upon our attention
it is fraught with great difficulty
unlike a case of war between independent nations
there is no authorized organ for us to treat with
no one man has authority to give up the rebellion for any other man
we simply must begin with and mold from disorganized and discordant elements
nor is it a small additional embarrassment that we
the loyal people
differ among ourselves as to the mode
and measure of reconstruction
as a general rule
i abstain from reading the reports of attacks upon myself
wishing not to be provoked by that to which i cannot properly offer an answer
in spite of this precaution
it comes to my knowledge that i am much censured for some supposed agency in setting up and seeking to sustain the new state government of louisiana
in this i have done just so much as
and no more than
the public knows
in the annual message of december
and in the accompanying proclamation
i presented a plan of reconstruction
as the phrase goes
which i promised
if adopted by any state
should be acceptable to and sustained by the executive government of the nation
i distinctly stated that this was not the only plan which might possibly be acceptable
and i also distinctly protested that the executive claimed no right to say when or whether members should be admitted to seats in congress from such states
this plan was
in advance
submitted to the then cabinet
and distinctly approved by every member of it
one of them suggested that i should then and in that connection apply the emancipation proclamation to the theretofore excepted parts of virginia and louisiana that i should drop the suggestion about apprenticeship for freed people
and that i should omit the protest against my own power in regard to the admission of members to congress
but even he approved every part and parcel of the plan which has since been employed or touched by the action of louisiana
the new constitution of louisiana
declaring emancipation for the whole state
practically applies the proclamation to the part previously excepted
it does not adopt apprenticeship for freed people
and it is silent
as it could not well be otherwise
about the admission of members to congress
so that
as it applies to louisiana
every member of the cabinet fully approved the plan
the message went to congress
and i received many commendations of the plan
written and verbal
and not a single objection to it from any professed emancipationist came to my knowledge until after the news reached washington that the people of louisiana had began to move in accordance with it
from about july
i had corresponded with different persons supposed to be interested in seeking a reconstruction of a state government for louisiana
when the message of 1863
with the plan before mentioned
reached new orleans
general banks wrote me he was confident that the people
with his military cooperation
would reconstruct substantially on that plan
i wrote him and some of them to try it
they tried it
and the result is known
such only has been my agency in getting up the louisiana government
as to sustaining it
my promise is out
as before stated
but as bad promises are better broken than kept
i shall treat this as a bad promise
and break it whenever i shall be convinced that keeping it is adverse to the public interest but i have not yet been so convinced
i have been shown a letter on this subject
supposed to be an able one
in which the writer expresses regret that my mind has not seemed to be definitely fixed on the question whether the seceded states
so called
are in the union or out of it
it would
add astonishment to his regret were he to learn that since i have found professed union men endeavoring to make that question
i have purposely forborne any public expression upon it
as appears to me
that question has not been
nor yet is
a practically material one
and that any discussion of it
while it thus remains practically immaterial
could have no effect other than the mischievous one of dividing our friends
as yet
whatever it may hereafter become
that question is bad as the basis of a controversy
and good for nothing at all a merely pernicious abstraction
we all agree that the seceded states
so called
are out of their proper practical relation with the union
and that the sole object of the government
civil and military
in regard to those states is to again get them into that proper practical relation
i believe that it is not only possible
but in fact easier
to do this without deciding or even considering whether these states have ever been out of the union
than with it
finding themselves safely at home
it would be utterly immaterial whether they had ever been abroad
let us all join in doing the acts necessary to restoring the proper practical relations between these states and the union
and each forever after innocently
indulge his own opinion whether in doing the acts he brought the states from without into the union
or only gave them proper assistance
they never having been out of it
the amount of constituency
so to speak
on which the new louisiana government rests
would be more satisfactory to all if it contained 50
or 30
or even 20
instead of only about 12
as it really does
it is also unsatisfactory to some that the elective franchise is not given to the colored man
i would myself prefer that it were now conferred on the very intelligent
and on those who serve our cause as soldiers
the question is not whether the louisiana government
as it stands
is quite all that is desirable
the question is
will it be wiser to take it as it is and help to improve it
or to reject and disperse it
can louisiana be brought into proper practical relation with the union sooner by sustaining or by discarding her new state government
some twelve thousand voters in the heretofore slave state of louisiana have sworn allegiance to the union
assumed to be the rightful political power of the state
held elections
organized a state government
adopted a free state constitution
giving the benefit of public schools equally to black and white
and empowering the legislature to confer the elective franchise upon the colored man
their legislature has already voted to ratify the constitutional amendment recently passed by congress
abolishing slavery throughout the nation
these twelve thousand persons are thus fully committed to the union and to perpetual freedom in the state committed to the very things
and nearly all the things
the nation wants and they ask the nation's recognition and its assistance to make good their committal
if we reject and spurn them
we do our utmost to disorganize and disperse them
in effect
say to the white man
you are worthless or worse we will neither help you
nor be helped by you
to the blacks we say
this cup of liberty which these
your old masters
hold to your lips we will dash from you
and leave you to the chances of gathering the spilled and scattered contents in some vague and undefined when
and how
if this course
discouraging and paralyzing both white and black
has any tendency to bring louisiana into proper practical relations with the union
i have so far been unable to perceive it
on the contrary
we recognize and sustain the new government of louisiana
the converse of all this is made true
we encourage the hearts and nerve the arms of the twelve thousand to adhere to their work
and argue for it
and proselyte for it
and fight for it
and feed it
and grow it
and ripen it to a complete success
the colored man too
in seeing all united for him
is inspired with vigilance
and energy
and daring
to the same end
grant that he desires the elective franchise
will he not attain it sooner by saving the already advanced steps toward it than by running backward over them
concede that the new government of louisiana is only to what it should be as the egg is to the fowl
we shall sooner have the fowl by hatching the egg than by smashing it
if we reject louisiana we also reject one vote in favor of the proposed amendment to the national constitution
to meet this proposition it has been argued that no more than three fourths of those states which have not attempted secession are necessary to validly ratify the amendment
i do not commit myself against this further than to say that such a ratification would be questionable
and sure to be persistently questioned
while a ratification by three fourths of all the states would be unquestioned and unquestionable
i repeat the question
can louisiana be brought into proper practical relation with the union sooner by sustaining or by discarding her new state government
what has been said of louisiana will apply generally to other states
and yet so great peculiarities pertain to each state
and such important and sudden changes occur in the same state
and withal so new and unprecedented is the whole case that no exclusive and inflexible plan can safely be prescribed as to details and collaterals
such exclusive and inflexible plan would surely become a new entanglement
important principles may and must be inflexible
in the present situation
as the phrase goes
it may be my duty to make some new announcement to the people of the south
i am considering
and shall not fail to act when satisfied that action will be proper

december 20
1859 i was born february 12
in hardin county
my parents were born in virginia
of undistinguished families second families
perhaps i should say
my mother
who died in my tenth year
was of a family of the name of hanks
some of whom now reside in adams
and others in macon county
my paternal grandfather
abraham lincoln
emigrated from rockingham county
to kentucky about 1781 or 1782
where a year or two later he was killed by the indians
not in battle
but by stealth
when he was laboring to open a farm in the forest
his ancestors
who were quakers
went to virginia from berks county
an effort to identify them with the new england family of the same name ended in nothing more definite than a similarity of christian names in both families
such as enoch
and the like
my father
at the death of his father
was but six years of age
and he grew up literally without education
he removed from kentucky to what is now spencer county
in my eighth year
we reached our new home about the time the state came into the union
it was a wild region
with many bears and other wild animals still in the woods
there i grew up
there were some schools
so called
but no qualification was ever required of a teacher beyond readin
and cipherin' to the rule of three
if a straggler supposed to understand latin happened to sojourn in the neighborhood
he was looked upon as a wizard
there was absolutely nothing to excite ambition for education
of course
when i came of age
i did not know much
i could read
and cipher to the rule of three
but that was all
i have not been to school since
the little advance i now have upon this store of education i have picked up from time to time under the pressure of necessity
i was raised to farm work
which i continued till i was twenty two
at twenty one i came to illinois
macon county
then i got to new salem
at that time in sangamon
now in menard county
where i remained a year as a sort of clerk in a store
then came the black hawk war and i was elected a captain of volunteers
a success which gave me more pleasure than any i have had since
i went the campaign
was elated
ran for the legislature the same year 1832
and was beaten the only time i ever have been beaten by the people
the next and three succeeding biennial elections i was elected to the legislature
i was not a candidate afterward
during this legislative period i had studied law
and removed to springfield to practise it
in 1846 i was once elected to the lower house of congress
was not a candidate for re election
from 1849 to 1854
both inclusive
practised law more assiduously than ever before
always a whig in politics and generally on the whig electoral tickets
making active canvasses
i was losing interest in politics when the repeal of the missouri compromise aroused me again
what i have done since then is pretty well known
if any personal description of me is thought desirable
it may be said i am
in height
six feet four inches
nearly lean
in flesh
weighing on an average one hundred and eighty pounds dark complexion
with coarse black hair and gray eyes
no other marks or brands recollected
notes communication to the people of sangamon county this announcement of political principles appeared in the sangamon journal
at that time the only newspaper published in springfield
the present text
which differs in some details from that found in the various editions of lincoln's works
follows the original
except in changing the spelling of sangamo to sangamon
perpetuation of our political institutions
on the close of the address resolutions were passed requesting the author to furnish a copy to the press
but for some unexplained reason it was not published until a year later
the present text is taken from the sangamon journal
lincoln was one of the organizers of the lyceum
all through his life lincoln showed a marked respect for the law
and the present warning against the consequences of lawlessness
so rhetorically sounded by the young orator of twenty eight
was a perfectly sincere expression of a profound conviction
the gates of hell
matthew xvi
this quotation was repeated in a speech delivered at indianapolis twenty four years later
when civil war was threatening
the springfield speech during the summer of 1858 lincoln delivered two important anti slavery speeches at springfield
the first and more important of these was made june 16
at the close of the republican state convention
at which lincoln was declared the party candidate for the united states senate
the second
delivered a month later
is in part a defence and explanation of the earlier speech
which had been severely criticised by lincoln's old opponent judge douglas
the first springfield speech was very carefully prepared and the ms
was submitted to several of lincoln's friends
all of whom objected to the opening statement as being impolitic and sure to lose the speaker the position for which he was a candidate
lincoln refused to make any change
saying that he preferred to go down linked with truth
if that was necessary
by herndon the date is given as june 17
a house divided against itself
suggested by matthew xii
and mark iii
this quotation had already been used in 1843 in a whig circular signed by lincoln and two others
and in a letter written in 1863 lincoln speaks of the government as a house divided against itself
nebraska doctrine
the doctrine of squatter sovereignty was recognized in the bill
introduced in the senate january 4
by douglas
to give territorial government to the district west of missouri and iowa known as nebraska
a similar bill had been introduced the year before by douglas
in its original form the bill contained no reference to the repeal of the missouri compromise
but in the form in which it was passed it declared the missouri compromise to be null and void
under the terms of this compromise slavery had been restricted to the territory south of 36 degrees 30 minutes
dred scott decision
this decision was rendered march 6
silliman letter
a statement on the situation in kansas by the electors of connecticut
which received its name from professor silliman of yale college
by whom it was in the main drawn up
lecompton constitution
in 1857 a convention was held at lecompton
to draw up a state constitution
in this convention the advocates of slavery were in the majority and the instrument was so prepared as not to interfere with slavery wherever it already existed in the territory
the free soil advocates refused to accept this constitution
when the question of admitting kansas under the lecompton constitution was presented before congress
in accordance with his principles of popular sovereignty
broke with his party and opposed the effort
from our present point of view lincoln does not seem to do douglas justice
the reference is to stephen a
president franklin pierce
chief justice roger b
and james buchanan
lincoln's perfectly sincere belief in a deliberate conspiracy among these men to perpetuate slavery
which was shared by many republicans of that time
is not sustained by the impartial investigations of later historians
mclean or curtis
john mclean and benjamin r
curtis were the only justices who were strongly opposed to the dred scott decision
who was a whig from massachusetts and who resigned the same year
wrote a minority decision
chase and mace
salmon p
chase was at that time senator from ohio
daniel mace was a democrat representative
who was opposed to the nebraska bill

the freeport debate
the lincoln douglas joint debates took place in seven towns in various parts of illinois between august 21 and october 15
the proposal for these meetings was made by lincoln in a note addressed to douglas
the length of each debate and the division of time between the speakers are stated in the opening sentence of the speech given in the text
the speeches
which were all extempore
as far as the actual form is concerned
were later collected from the newspaper reports
and after some slight revision by the authors were published in 1860 in columbus
this volume
from which the present text is taken
contained in addition a number of speeches delivered by lincoln and douglas earlier in 1858 and two speeches made by lincoln in ohio in 1859
lincoln's statement at the close of a letter to the publishers
accompanying the copy for the book
is characteristic and interesting
i wish the reprint to be precisely as the copies i send
without any comment whatever
this columbus issue was used as a republican campaign document and large numbers were sold
the freeport debate
the second in the series
was held on the afternoon of august 27
with the exception of the galesburg debate
it was the most largely attended of the seven meetings
and in its effect upon the campaign it is now regarded as the most important
judge douglas and myself
in the informal speeches lincoln frequently committed errors of speech like this
even during the presidential period he shows a marked tendency to use the cleft infinitive
but in the carefully written addresses the language is almost always correct
fugitive slave law
this statute was passed in 1850 for the stricter regulation of the return of escaped slaves to their owners
in his answer to this question lincoln showed clearly that he was not an abolitionist
as that term was then understood
question 2
douglas' reply to this question was as follows
i answer emphatically
as mr
lincoln has heard me answer a hundred times from every stump in illinois that in my opinion the people of a territory can
by lawful means
exclude slavery from their limits prior to the formation of a state constitution
it is claimed that this question was put by lincoln in spite of the protests of several of his friends
who believed that it would give douglas an advantage
but here
as in the equally feared springfield speech
lincoln proved his superior sagacity
douglas' affirmative answer probably gained him the senatorship
but it certainly lost him the presidency two years later
first republican state convention
the reference is to a meeting held in springfield
which was addressed by owen lovejoy
lincoln was not present on this occasion
recent investigation seems to show that there was no foundation for the charge that this was exclusively a meeting of abolitionists
but that it included many men who held the same political views as lincoln
douglas honestly believed that the resolutions read by him at the ottawa meeting were genuine and he was greatly chagrined at the mistake
by an amendment
this amendment was offered by douglas
the cooper institute address
this address
lincoln's first important direct message to the people of the east
was very carefully prepared
the text in this volume is taken from the tribune tract
issued as a campaign document
the northwestern territory
the district comprising the present states of ohio
and wisconsin
had been ceded to the national government by the original states
black republicans
douglas constantly referred to his opponents under this title
in the ottawa debate he affirmed that in 1854 lincoln and trumbull had arranged to form an abolition party
under the name and disguise of a republican party
popular sovereignty
this principle is defined by douglas as follows
my principle is to recognize each state of the union as independent
and equal in its sovereignty
harper's ferry
john brown
john brown was a new englander
who had taken an active part in the kansas disorders in 1856
during the summer of 1859 he engaged in an attempt to free the slaves of virginia
after capturing the arsenal at harper's ferry
he was overpowered by a body of marines and with the survivors of his army
was hanged
by the extreme anti slavery people he was regarded as a martyr
the best expression of this spirit being given by mrs
julia ward howe's battle hymn of the republic
in a speech in congress of january 16
senator douglas had stated his firm and deliberate conviction that the harper's ferry crime was the natural
inevitable result of the doctrines and teachings of the republican party
the southampton insurrection
the reference is to a slave insurrection which occurred in 1831 in southampton
helper's book
hinton p
a north carolinian of the so called poor white class
was the author of a book on the effects of slavery
entitled the impending crisis in the south
the special reference is to the recent agreement among sixty four republican representatives to publish a compendium of the book for circulation in doubtful states
the farewell speech
this beautiful little address was delivered from the platform of the car that bore the president elect away from his old home
it has been preserved in two slightly differing versions
neither of which probably exactly reproduces the words used
the springfield papers
which were followed by herndon
gave an inaccurate report that robbed the speech of much of its rare beauty
the first inaugural address
the first inaugural was carefully written in springfield a month before its delivery
contrary to his usual practice in public speaking
lincoln read from the ms
the address was enthusiastically received by an immense audience assembled front of the capitol and the general impression produced at the north was favorable
by the southern and the abolition press it was severely criticised
both with regard to its form and its content
the mystic chords of memory
this passage was suggested by mr
to whom the address had been submitted for criticism
the customary usury of genius was paid for the verbal loan
response to serenade
this speech was delivered before a delegation of new yorkers
who called at the white house on the evening of march 4
two other similar responses have been preserved from the same day
the present address is reprinted here for the first time
from the new york times
letter to horace greeley
greeley's letter of august 19
which was headed the prayer of twenty millions
began as follows
i do not intrude to tell you for you must know already that a great proportion of those who triumphed in your election
and of all who desire the unqualified suppression of the rebellion now desolating our country
are sorely disappointed and deeply pained by the policy you seem to be pursuing
that lincoln had good reason to complain of an impatient and dictatorial tone is sufficiently shown by the closing sentence
i entreat you to render hearty and unequivocal obedience to the laws of the land
the following issue of the tribune contained a long editorial on the same subject
the influence of the tribune in the northern states was immense
and lincoln realized the importance of making a clear statement of his policy to its readers
second annual message to congress
after a long statement about the conditions of the finances and of the different departments
the president devoted the remainder of the space to the discussion of compensated emancipation
on which he had already made a recommendation earlier in the year in a special message to congress
the concluding paragraph is in the elevated style of the inaugurals
the emancipation proclamation
the first draft of the proclamation was submitted to the cabinet in the preceding july
with the remark that he had fully determined to issue it immediately
secretary seward suggested that its issue be postponed until it could be given to the country supported by some military success
the president saw the force of the suggestion and waited until after the battle of antietam
the preliminary proclamation was dated september 22
in a reply to a serenade two days later the president said
i can only trust in god i have made no mistake
upon military necessity
this phrase was inserted in the concluding sentence
which had been suggested by secretary chase
as furnishing the only authority by which the president felt that he could free the slaves of the enemy
the proclamation did not refer to those slaves held by persons who were not in rebellion
letter to j
conkling was a personal friend of the president
and the formal letter was accompanied by the following note
my dear conkling
i cannot leave here now
herewith is a letter instead
you are one of the best public readers
i have but one request read it very slowly and now god bless you
and all good union men
in spite of precautions
the letter was published in the new york evening post several days before the meeting
i know as fully as one can know
the portion of the paragraph from these words to the end was not in the original letter
but was added by telegraph
the gettysburg address
the standard text of the address does not agree exactly either with the original written form or with the form in which it was delivered
but it is a combination of these
made by lincoln a few days later
in the contemporary newspaper reports it was variously referred to as an address
a speech
and remarks
government of the people
the thought contained in this sentence was not original with lincoln
but it has been traced back through several centuries
it was probably suggested to lincoln by the following passage in an address by theodore parker
which he is known to have read
democracy is direct self government over all the people
for all the people
by all the people
the second inaugural address
this address is in marked contrast
both in length and character
to president lincoln's first official communication
some of the main thoughts and two of the biblical quotations occur in a letter written may 30
let us judge not
that we be not judged
adapted from matthew vii
woe unto the world
matthew xviii
fondly do we hope
the accidental rhyme in this passage is the only blemish that has been objected to in the address
and it is not serious
the judgments of the lord
psalms xix
the opening words of the last paragraph are the best expression ever given of the spirit of lincoln
who on another occasion said
i have never willingly planted a thorn in any man's bosom
the last speech
this address
the longest of the presidential period with the exception of the first inaugural
was delivered before a great crowd gathered in front of the white house
four days before lincoln's assassination
the evening before
on a similar occasion
he had requested the people to wait until he could prepare his remarks
adding that he wished to be careful
as everything he said got into print
the newspaper reports of the following day state that it was received with great enthusiasm
the address is of special interest as indicating the attitude of the president toward the difficult question of reconstruction
the evacuation of petersburg and richmond
april 2 and 3 respectively
general lee surrendered april 9
the new constitution of louisiana
the constitution was adopted september 5
the proposed amendment
the thirteenth amendment
abolishing slavery throughout the united states
was proposed in 1864
but failed to receive the necessary two thirds vote in the house of representatives
it was passed in 1865
and after receiving the endorsement of the necessary number of states went into effect december 15 of the same year
lincoln's gettysburg address
given november 19
1863 on the battlefield near gettysburg
usa four score and seven years ago
our fathers brought forth upon this continent a new nation
conceived in liberty
and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal
now we are engaged in a great civil war
testing whether that nation
or any nation so conceived and so dedicated
can long endure
we are met on a great battlefield of that war
we have come to dedicate a portion of that field as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that this nation might live
it is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this
in a larger sense
we cannot dedicate
we cannot consecrate
we cannot hallow this ground
the brave men
living and dead
who struggled here have consecrated it
far above our poor power to add or detract
the world will little note
nor long remember
what we say here
but it can never forget what they did here
it is for us the living
to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced
it is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us
that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion
that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain
that this nation
under god
shall have a new birth of freedom
and that government of the people
by the people
for the people
shall not perish from this earth
